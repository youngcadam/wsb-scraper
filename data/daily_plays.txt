Also Robinhood: Congratulations on your free share: SIRIUS XM $5.88 (-1.01%)

Your friend: Trading is boring I think I'm gonna close my account. Anyways thanks for the free Google share or whatever.For the noobies, PLUG was a banned ticker on WSB 1 year ago and if you talked about it you were labeled a “shill” or “pump and dump” 🤡Just got a message that I was permanently banned from r/personalfinance for posting about the ETFs: ICLN, ARKG, ARKK, LIT

The post I commented under was asking about advice on which ETFs they should add to their portfolio, and so I recommend some of the ones that I have in my portfolio. The mods mentioned that I was “trolling” and broke a rule that apparently does not allow people to post about either of those ETFs. 

I was genuinely trying to help. What the fuck.My father died today.  Hug your kids/parents just a little bit longer today.I think I’m addicted to this subredditUsually I'm good with "profit is profit" but my missed profit on PLUG is going to make me sickI day trade TSLA stock options just to feel alive.You motherfuckers who are like:

*cant believe I sold XYZ last year. I’d be millionaire now*


Need to STFU. No one posting in here can hold shit for a week let alone some FLAT shit for a year.YOU SEE A BUBBLE I SEE THE BEGINNING OF A SEVEN YEAR BULL RUN

Thanks Dad, I love you.LMFAO Doordash up 15% get the absolute fuck out of here 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂CRAMER PUMPING CATHIE WOOD OMG DREAMS DO COME TRUE HE CALLED HER QUEEN MIDASICLN gang rise we up 1.3% AHIt's psychologically exhausting to see every play you make, that is well thought out and planned, just tank. And then you have all the plays that you were thinking about making( all the fomo plays) but didn't, just take off and gap up 100% in a week. One time that happens, fine. Twice, you're probably really annoyed. But to have it happen again and again, shit is fucking exhausting. Been trading for years and while I'm happy to see a lot of you make a killing, I'm starting to think whether something like that will ever happen to me. I'm just so fucking sick of losing to the point where it just fills me with anger and disgust. Please universe, throw me a fucking bone. 🙏Biden needs to pass his stimulus right away so I can load up on FCEL and more ICLNcan't believe I avoided PLUG when it was 11$ cuz people were laughing in here for people buying it at that price when they bought it for 3$Making 50-100% gains on EV SPACs I know nothing about other than what I read here is starting to get concerningICLN gang check in 😤😤😤how many people are actually working with accounts over 25k?

Don’t be a haterThe fact that Elon sent a random stock SIGL skyrocketing from \~$6 - $38 by complete accident when people just misunderstood a tweet shows the retard strength behind TSLA. There is no top.Holding these TSLA weeklies overnight. Pray for me.AAPL up 0.09%, more than I could ever have dreamedPlug shares seem like a steal, company is only trading at 200x revenue. That should be much higher!Tim Cook: *Yes the big announcement is that here at Apple we believe in freedom and unity lol*

Genius.My father was a retard, my grandfather was retard, and I am also a retard.**How much $20,000 invested in SPY at the bottom in March is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 1/15/21 $300** strike calls was **2.07**. Lets say we used $20k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

SPY 1/15 $300 calls at the ask price of 78.78 which gives us a total value of:

[https://imgur.com/a/NrC5JJE](https://imgur.com/a/NrC5JJE) 

ICLN had a 'golden cross' moment (my first green arrow from left to right: 7EMA passing 100EMA). As soon as this occurred, there was an influx in volume (400K volume) spike, mostly options driven. Of those options, 73% were bulls (calls) and 27% were bears (puts). Majority lead, bulls. The average price target on options was at a $1.98 above it's current trading value which is $32.34, which puts the majority of the bullish call options around a \~$34 call. As a result, the relative strength index (bottom green arrow) has been tapering around 65%. This indicates potential further upwards momentum. And for those who didn't read this... here are some rockets.  🚀🚀🚀  TLDR: $ICLN Call options in April/July at $34C will print, anticipate the ticker to hit a $34C by Friday post-Biden announcement.

Gonna tell him my net worth is already locked up in TSLA derivatives.Since I started frequenting WSB, the rest of Reddit has become incredibly...bleh, more so than it already was. It's not the whole "too PC" thing either, which I honestly don't care about at all, but people here just take themselves so much less seriously -- it's so refreshing and fun to be a part of.

> THIS IS THE MOTHER OF ALL BUBBLES

Someone call patrick star in here, he can stretch a bubble like a mofoJust late night thoughts... I don’t post much on Reddit but I was thinking VALE is probably going to the moon.

My thought process behind it is Apple is working on a EV. Tesla is dominating the market with EV. Nickel will be in super high demand but the main point is VALE strive on being an eco friendly mining company. Which Apple and Tesla both push for being eco friendly in their companies. If Apple works with another manufacturer they are going to make sure that they play by apples rules. Apple rules mean eco friendly no matter what. Just like removing all charging bricks from phones watch’s and even there wireless chargers. 

So to summarize Apple and Tesla will both need nickel for there cars and VALE is a cleaner mining company. VALE to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes upl gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies report blowout Q4 earnings and give super optimistic guidance for 2021. However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. 

Have a nice rest of the evening folks!

Calls on APPLNice I gambled away all my money and have nothing left to pay for college

Was good knowing youPresident Biden, with the help of a Democrat-controlled House + Senate, will pump $2.4 trillion into the sector during 2021. My prediction is that sometime in the next 5 years, **ICLN** will cost $300+ per share (maybe more). Getting it now is still an absolute steal. Get in now before the real pump happens. This is once in a lifetime opportunity, we haven't seen an infrastructure change like this since the industrial revolution. The dam has broken, and smart money, even oil companies such as Shell and BP, have already started pouring funds into the clean energy sector.

The energy sector is about to turn upside down and clean energy will be the only way to power anything by 2035.

AAPL 420c 1/15The Wall Street Journal online comment section might be the most boomery place in the history of the universe.  Boomers, boomers everywhere! Here is a legit excerpt from our friend David S.:

>I'd rather own Berkshire, and get solid returns over the next 25 years, with minimal risk allowing me to sleep at night, versus something like NIO which could go up 100% the next few years, or very possibly go back down to $10 or so... Young people chasing these high flying EV stocks haven't experienced the pain of the dot com bubble.  And they don't have families to support yet, so "preservation of capital" is not top of mind for them.  They will eventually learn.Bought 25k in PLUG puts 10 minutes before close.

I’ve been shilling ICLN here for a week or so and we’ve made some fat racks, now ima tell you about a ticker just like PLUG.

This motherfucker has been mooning for a couple of weeks now, and hit a whopping **37%** today. As of now it’s trading at **$10.67**

The chart on this grade-A fuckable stock looks just like PLUG, and the best part is the ticker.

That’s right. The ticker is already in space.

Now i’m not a scientist or an astronaut, but I do know that once you’re in space it’s a **helluvalot easier to get to the moon.**

AAPL to the moonCarly Rae Jepsen years ago started as a meme, and now she’s probably the best pop artist in the world.Hot take. I was just thinking, online shopping should be like selling covered puts. Instead of announcing sell, customers bid on prices they are willing to pay for a product, you also have ATM option to purchase now. Like selling puts on a $5k Tv at $4k. The seller has the option to exercise anytime.

Edit: yes like eBay but bestbuy and Costco doing it with all their return customer service etc...Okay, hear me out guys. 
Apple’s big news is this: all stores are for vaccines, and if you get one, you get a discount on the new Hyundai/canoo vehicle, but they will keep tabs on you with palantir, and will partner with Tesla for their batteries. All this while going green by using PLUG to power all their stores. 
That covers all the meme stocks, right?I'm going to say the grossest thing ever. I just buy. I never sell. I guess I'm an investor...?Bears holding out their empty portfolios by the bus stop:

> While Canoo now has the money it sought at the beginning of 2020, that hasn’t softened its ambitions to work with big companies like Apple. The startup said in that same SEC filing that it is “currently in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging Canoo’s technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.” 

My reading of this article is that previous Apple talks fell apart, not that current/future ones are off the table.Apple was willing to buy Canoo, and the executives/board had the confidence in their company to reject the acquisition. Now, months later, they got a partnership with Hyundai and coincidentally Apple is partnering with Hyundai too.So much apple news so little apple tendiesCanoo gang, idk what the fuck happened, but we're waking up on the moon tomorrowAAPL pls flyAnother day, another EV SPAC popping off in my accountI would give my left nut for a massively Green Day tomorrow.🛶🛶🛶 my Canoo calls printing tomorrow!!!

When his next SPAC is announced for either IPOD/IPOF, sell once the stock exceeds 50% gains at opening (calls w/ 500% gain), or exercise your calls if you're a LT investor (which I know none of you degenerates are). Chamath's the best marketer in the game right now. He will make you money, but you have to be positioned.Assuming I have the balls to hold and not sell on swings, is ARKK where I should put my life savings for the next 5 years? Honest questionThis market is gonna trade sideways forever apparently. Every dip gets bought up because people think it’s never gonna go lower. Then every new high gets sold off because valuations suddenly matter at that point unless it’s the Russell 2000. 🤡🤡Feeling like shit because you missed the PLUG train? KTOS is the next rocket.

Population of India = 1.366 billion
Population of China = 1.398 billion
World population = 7.794 billion

Total market of India and China represent 35% of the world's population. 

Therefore, TSLA valuation deserves 35% of the world's total money supply which is $80.9 trillion according to [Business Insider ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/all-of-worlds-money-in-one-chart-2015-12%3famp). This roughly translates to about $30,000 per share.

Thank you Mr. Sanders and Buyden. As the new Budget Committee Chair, Sanders wants to rev up stimulus, and pump cash into the economy to help build it back up. He'll use reconciliation to get most things Buyden wants thru the senate. It should now be fairly easy to get funding for stimulus, healthcare, climate change, etc.

Issuer:  Affirm Holdings, Inc.

Offering:  Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO

The registration statement for Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO WILL NOT be declared effective and the offering priced this evening, 01/12/2021.  Therefore Personal Investments (PI) has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering for the following reasons: 

PI is required by the SEC to obtain confirmations on indications of interest after effectiveness but before secondary market trading in Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO begins.  The Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering is NOW expected to be declared effective tomorrow morning, 01/13/2021 and trading in the secondary market will begin immediately afterwards.  As a result, there would be insufficient amount of time for PI to obtain customer confirmations and complete the allocation process prior to the security's trading in the secondary market.  Therefore, PI has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering.

3.	⁠Add the wet ingredients into the dry and mix until just combined. Lastly mix in the melted butter and stir until combined, the batter will be slightly lumpy.
4.	⁠Set the batter aside while you heat your griddle to medium-low heat. Melt a small pat of butter on the griddle and then scoop out 1/4 cup of pancake batter onto the hot griddle and top evenly with blueberries, as many or few as you prefer.

Thank me laterI just binge ate so hard. Fuck me. This lockdown is killing my gainslicense to kill pump n dumpers who post their gay dds at 4:01pm on fridaysHere sneky, sneky, Snek. Let me touch it.Just thought of the craziest fucking idea. What if scientists find a way to make people immortal but they have to take others people life force away. So when everyone human is born is given a random amount of "years" to live. To extend your life you can take it or transfer it from other people. So the world has rendered money useless and instead people use their "time" as a form of currency. So if you want a coffee well that cost a minute of your life. And your wages are paid in extra time. So in the stock market we can gamble our time and to actually YOLO you can literally die or become immortal.Why are you retards awake?holy shit GOEV 👀Giant green dildo on ICLN 🤑🤑🤑My retired mom bought TSLA shares in the March dip because she heard about it from her boomer friends. Obviously she's up a lot, so she started getting interest in TSLA and decided to sell her paid-off car and buy a Tesla car. Cool, it's her money and she's buying a cool car. The problem is, she called me this morning and told me she ordered a Model S and because she's not using a gas car anymore, she ordered the Tesla solar roof thing, the battery pack, and the Tesla wall charger. She basically dropped $100k on Tesla products because she's up a bit on the stocks. Not only that, when I went to her house to talk to her after the call, I found a poster of Elon Musk hung up next to my dead dad's ashes.

The execs didn’t want to be acquired and Apple wanted an acquisition. That means Apple really wanted access to the skateboard technology.

And now, almost a year later, Apple is talking with Hyundai who is partnered with Canoo. If Apple wants Canoo’s skateboard tech this badly, other companies will want it as well.“CCIV is crashing”

I've seen very few stocks be able to maintain any upwards momentum when they get that stretched. There will be at least one fat red daily candle for you to profit off of. Just have to get out once you get that red day or two, don't baghold.

Part of the reason why this works is because 90 on the daily is just crazytown. TSLA has only managed it once or twice. PLUG is actually still below 90 as of close today.Lottery grand prize is over 1 Billion dollars. Going all in.

What if apple partners with Tesla to produce its apple car. Elon knows about it and decide to make the apple tweet- as a way of cryptically telling us? 

Tim apple said we have something huge that isn’t a product— an apple car produce by Tesla. Would be huge. 

Not a product but a partnership. Paired by musks tweet today— you’re going to make it.

Tesla "Model $25k" being accelerated to 2022 is 𝙝𝙪𝙜𝙚 news: previous assumption was 2024-2025, and few TSLA valuation models include it.

Thanks jim say hi to the kidsIf you’re wondering why TSLA is not mooning on good news it’s cause all the good news about TSLA is priced in and it already mooned ladsDumb question but why do some of my upvotes show in red and then sometimes they are in green?How do you guys find all of these retarded companies?Angry orchard really isn’t very good tbhSince all of you are going to be rich soon I have some real world advice. If you fly less than 150 hours a year private do not buy your own private jet! Also if you do PLEASE for the love of god make sure the engines are on Corporate Care / Gold. Fucking things are $$$ and just because you have 3000 hours before TBO does not mean some Mechanic Jackass will not say one needs a overhaul / replacing during the annual!Fuck me.

###How many ANAL GoDs are there...?NGA CEO starting the day with Benzinga interview in the morning then heads over to a conference presentation on why they’re the shit.  Rumored ending the day with a Mad Money interview.

At pixel time, the French car company’s shares are up 1.5 per cent to €36.80 on the news. That gives it a valuation of just under €11bn.
Yet in early trading, Plug Power’s share price is up 17 per cent to $62.36, giving it a market capitalisation of $30bn. Yes, that’s billion with a ‘B’.
So, in short, the press release caused the market to forecast that the discounted value of Plug Power’s future cash flows from this joint-venture agreement will be worth almost exactly a third of Renault’s market value (which, as a reminder, is the discounted value of its total future cash flows).

If I buy a call option and the contract goes up in value and then I sell it before expiration, do I then owe the person I sold the option to the underlying shares at expiration if it’s above the strike price? Or is that the person who originally sold me the options contract? 

I’m tempted to trade options once I’m 18 but I really don’t want to be one of those guys who goes into negative balance cos they had no idea what they were doing.

At pixel time, the French car company’s shares are up 1.5 per cent to €36.80 on the news. That gives it a valuation of just under €11bn.
Yet in early trading, Plug Power’s share price is up 17 per cent to $62.36, giving it a market capitalisation of $30bn. Yes, that’s billion with a ‘B’.
So, in short, the press release caused the market to forecast that the discounted value of Plug Power’s future cash flows from this joint-venture agreement will be worth almost exactly a third of Renault’s market value (which, as a reminder, is the discounted value of its total future cash flows).

Find a stock you wouldn't mind owning that is a good value. Dividend stocks are bad for this.

Buy a call and sell a put. Both at the money. Total cost $0. Have the put be cash secured. If the stock goes up, sell some of the calls (not all) and all of the puts. Now you have all the upside of calls and no downside. You can move on to the next stock and repeat.

If it goes down you will just end up owning the stock.

AOC has a man faceMango on TV earlier bragging about his great border wall, talking about coyotes and illegals waiting Biden's term to get into the "gravy train" that is democrat policies.

Dude, Democrats aren't exactly going to open the door and wave people through (see MAGA Capitol police) they are however going to improve international relations.

To be insane tomorrowI put 5k into a  SPY Jan 21 2022 485c. If market does 30 % next calendar year it is worth 30k.... If SPY does 40% next year it turns into 155k.  Thinking of doing another chunk into QQQ and IWB. Shit IWB did 50% since the March low. Buy and diamond hand.

Edit
Yea I'm a retard... They are 2022 fixed it. again 40% is top end. I make a decent return with 30%. You don't think full dem control is going to open the infrastructure money gates?Anybody here ever fuck a girl that told you she just sees you as a friend ?fuck i’m too scared to see TSLA premarket I wanna just sleep first so I don’t worry about it# HOLY MEGA GREEN DILDOTracking ICLN Euro holdings at open, with weight rank:

There are so many missing commas in this thread. So little correct punctuation, capitalization, etc. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, SPY to 385 EoW.Oh my god GOEV after hours I am going to fucking cumI honestly think Tesla will hit 900 EOW but definitely 870 tomorrow we tested it today but didn’t have the trading volume to past itIsn’t GME’s ultimate game plan entirely like Blockbusters? Blockbuster realized it was losing market share and copied Redbox and tried to get video on-demand but was too late and died. Coronavirus + new console was saving grace for GME but let’s be honest — you didn’t try to get that PS5 at GameStop. You first tried Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart before succumbing and standing in line with the neckbeards who sell new releases back for under the going eBay price. 

I know you all are only here for the short squeeze but I get a bad feeling about investing certainties. Something tells me your timing will be off and theta and IV will screw you. Well, good luck then.AOC is life rn 👀

Rode the 2000 tech crash to become a millionaire at 15 years old.

Used AOL IM to hook up with milfs and I could be your daddy.Imagine being a bear. SPY hits another milestone at 380. You give it your best shot and think that this is finally it. SPY spends literally half an hour below 378 and instantly bounces. You know now in your heart that those 375P will expire worthless as we blast right through 380.

Oh well, no way it goes to 390!!I want to put it in Pelosi’s pooper.Don’t ever let anyone, for any reason, convince you that anime is not a legitimate form of entertainment.

* Upstart AI lending platform, aggregates consumer demand for loans while connecting network of bank partners enabled with Upstart AI
* Significantly faster and more accurate than traditional lending models. This reduces loss rate while increasing the number of approved applicants 
* Recent IPO (Dec 16th), some big ol’ gains since then

They appear to be the only big player in their particular niche at the moment. If they establish a strong partner network it seems likely to provide a deep moat and solidify their position.

Or... the pump and dump is coming in fast and hot.

While Canoo now has the money it sought at the beginning of 2020, that hasn’t softened its ambitions to work with big companies like Apple. The startup said in that same SEC filing that it is “currently in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging Canoo’s technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.”

FuckWHO IS DOWNVOTING? I will find you and upvote you!Who else is gonna buy this TSLA dip tomorrow? I heard its gonna get as low as 780!Plug almost gets me going as much as AOC🤤Today’s  moves. Had a good position in plug today made best gains I’ve ever had. Decided I wanted more exposure to hydrogen so I dumped meme stock nio which I fomo into yesterday for small loss, (people on Instagram were even pumping it yesterday, the echo chamber got to me, it was like I was fucking being subliminally programmed or some shit) put that shit into bldp when it was at $34. BLDP is leader in hydro for transit, buses, trains etc and it had a news release today about  a newly secured contract. rt it’s absolutely ripping ah so seems like a good move. Otherwise after seeing some gain porn on wsb about a dude make 20k off of 200$, put some speculative money on aqms. Made a grand on eng, don’t know why it shot the fuck up, it looks like a regular engineering consultancy that will struggle to compete with arcadis and Jacobs, but it’s meme stock with a cute ticker so a lot of autists.

On the bio side tried  getting more of Dtil but spreads too wide. Speculative position on ziop. Bought $500 worth of stock in amrn don’t know why except my cash needed to be parked  somewhere.

Tomorrow... really confused about eng. will probably see if I can trade it more or something or take out a small $200 dollar position, but the max leap is like july which is disappointing. May also speculate on fuel tech, ftek, another $200 or so. But really I shouldn’t make any moves. It’s wise not to feel like you should trade every day, but I’m a retardSo extremely bullish on TSLA, we dip for one day, then we pump for a week. Today was day 1, strap inJust curious, are any of you little shits from Nashvillewould lex luthor be an incel if he wasn't mega rich?How fucked are my Apple 130 calls that expire this Friday I bought at today’s dip ?

* The market went overbought on Dec. 2.
* The market will remain overbought until Jan. 13, 2021.
* The Big Money Index will peak on Monday, Dec. 21, 2020, at an S&P 500 level of 3,731.56.
* The S&P 500 will peak on Jan. 18, 2021, at a level of 3,828.50.
* The S&P 500 will then subsequently fall until Monday, April 19, when it will trough at 3,341.81.

Deadass they try so hard to play a good role in the movie, especially Gandalf (Ian Mckellian)!Guys, I think I’ve figured out what Palantir does and how they can actually expand their core products and business. I work with the network security field and to me besides business intelligence their core focus for their products is cyber security with the core product for commercial use being asset and information tracking and mapping. To me that can expand their product going one of two routes. Create APIs that also integrate with existing cyber security systems and build their data sets to also be able to analyze and track actual network analytics from the perimeter and multi site management of network security assets similar to solar winds, but also be able to build it out so network traffic from malicious entities can be tracked within the UI so notjust for hunting and locating criminals but mapping attackers, the partners in attacks of a network, and using that information to identify the location and identity of the attacker. They could even build the system out to track where malicious software originated. 

They can truly build this out and customize it in truly unique ways. It can be a platform for physical security, cyber security, or simply to asset tracking and logging as in covid. This company isn’t just building with military in mind if you think about how they can expand their existing platform to even integrate with big players like Cisco and Palo Alto with APIs.You guys gotta stop trading on emotion.

Like, for a place that is all about betting and gambling they sure treated an ETF as if it was TESLAWrong. $400 EOY.Nice man!Should be tagged DD.

Retail sucks.I’m holding through earnings!sorry for your loss bro 😢 may he rest in peaceI’m sorry for your loss. Praying for you and your loved ones.calls on good dads, sorry man :(Sorry for your loss man. Beautiful post. He sounds like he was an amazing dude.I'd give you a wholesome award if I had one. I'm sorry for your loss and I'm glad that you loved your dad back and recognized your love for each other. It's not as common as you may think.RIPPrayers up my manIm sorry for your loss! You will always have the moments you spent with him.. and sometimes memories are the only things that stay forever ♥️RIP to him dude...he will always be with youHere’s a hug man 🤗.

Incredible, you’re so lucky to have had that. Hang in there and cherish the moments you had. Thinking of you.Do you own gme?Uh... why haven't you just bought TSLA calls. I'm up 20k this year on that alone.Bro honest advice take a month or two completely off. Don’t trade, don’t get on WSB, don’t look at the market just do other things. Come back less emotional and get ready to profit 🤘Try entering with a small position and then averaging down. Everything goes up eventually. That’s what I’m trying to do nowDo you try any momentum plays? It’s like, we all know many of these meme companies are complete crap with a few exceptions...just try to hop on and ride the train vs. doing a weeks worth of DD and missing it. 

If you’re buying tech/ev/genomics stocks lately it’s fucking easy mode. Just don’t get greedy and have an exit strategy. Sell the shit companies for short term gains and use that to buy shares of companies you believe in for the long term.What are you invested in now?Do you want a bone, or a ticker, strike price and date?If you are consistently losing Just do the opposite of what you want to doJust start inversing yourself. Looks like a shit play but retards on WSB have relatable emojis for it so they like it? Calls. Company looks like it has a lot of potential, you’ve spent hours doing DD and the company seems to be ready for take off? Puts.just take a break and start swinging/ stop weeklies/stop watching market.Dude. Buy. Fucking. Shares.Time to change strategies. Maybe your processes for choosing stocks are all wrongI don't know if this is what you're doing, but don't buy into the hype on certain stocks being hyped on WSB.  I've learned that by the time a lot of them are being hyped, they've already had a parabolic run, and are starting to level out or crater.  If everybody is talking about it, it's probably too late.Yeah man, I don’t think this is for you. Literally any tard could’ve made money this year. VTI and chill from now on?

Also I always pull any speculative profits and throw them into the main index fund account. 

You're right to be weary of the advice from people here.

CumExercise early in the morning when you wake upFeel you bro, others have already given you good advice, I would add watch some r/aww b4 bed.
And the underlying cause is probably stress, figure out why it's happening and a way to bring it down (meditation, exercise, physical activity, traveling, hell just relaxing in a hammock can help)I had 1 year of chronic insomnia in college, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. The main cause of it was initially anxiety, later on I found out when you don't sleep properly, yourbody starts to produce less and less sleep hormone and mix that with anxiety and then you created negative feedback loop of long term insomnia. Solution? Like other people said you have to replenish your sleep hormone, start taking melatonin supplements. If you want something natural, eat a banana and drink a glass of milk before you sleep. It really helps. Reverse psychology, start telling your self it's ok to not sleep instead of stress yourself out of it. They may just calm you down and help you sleep better. Also try to remove as much anxiety from your life as possible. That's the key to get your sleep back.

🧑‍🚀🔫🧑‍🚀Diamond hands here.......  ICLN Gang.950 EOWjoe manchinThe stock needs a 35% move to break even. I don't know why I keep telling people this... I'm the one selling them. Tons of iv baked in.Underwhelming green new deal? I’m long Icln though just postulatingPLEASE PLEAE DON’T YOU WILL HONESTLY LOSE A LARGR CHUNK OF YOUR MOOLA. 

Why?  It’s what I call the WSB INDICATOR.  
During any given week couple of week and if very lucky a month max.  There are a 2-4 stocks many “investors” better said degenerates including myself pile into. 

The first ones to go into the trade makes the most.  Logically they / we all advertise our positions in hope others also join. The ultimate dream is to find and sling calls on the next meme stock. 

However you can tell when it’s getting very hot and you need to sell or definitely not be the last dumbass buying at the top.   Maybe there’s still some room on ICLN however we are way closer to the beginning of a correction than a new lengthy pump.   

Scroll around and you’ll still find the poor souls asking when PLTR will pump again as they got killed and refuse to sell.   

Not saying ICLN is a bad idea, just think it’s horrible timing.  I’d also add PLUG, FCEL and even TSLA to this list.  There are sooooo many good stocks find one which gone up 20% in the last week.   

Check MSFT it’s been a dog and they are reporting at the end of the month. Without a doubt they will post fking amazing numbers.Could be making more doing something else. It’s not a bad position, but you askeddepends what exp. eft moves slowThere is none lol even dipping down today those leaps increased in value. 
PLUG & ENPH will carry ICLNPLUG is weighted at just over 8% of ICLNs holdings after today, if it pulls back we might see some red. I strongly believe ICLN is going to pump, here’s some rockets as proof 🚀🚀🚀too much moneyICLN has been artificially blaoted by retards on this sub. It may drop before it gets chugging again.

Additionally, there are other green etfs that may provide you more profit.

A loan on a car? LOL couldn’t be meFuck no. Use that money to make money!!!Never buy a new car if you like moneylol... howd you go from 40k to 400k...Get it. But not at that interest rate. If you’re buying new then you can find a better deal. Go to the dealership and tell them the only way you buy is with lower interest rates and they’ll work it out for you.Why don’t u run the wheel in a stock u will keep  and finance itHow much do you add to the market? Or are those gains? I’m 24 about to buy a motorcycle with my tendies. You might break your legs when you’re thirty or have kidsDo it but murder it out or sum shitMaybe buy a 2019  I mean it's already depreciated a little and it's the same carCongratulations on your success. Can confirm, a great feeling. 

Otherwise shut the fuck up.4runner gangBuy a Tacoma instead and trick it out. Even a Tacoma that’s old af is still well over 10k if it’s taken care of4Runners retain their value really well. But you seem like the type that would make it a lifelong vehicle 🥶Bronco 🎠G-ClassHow did you 1,000% in a year? Congrats dude!

P.S.
Get the car if it brings you joy. Money shouldn't be the end in of itself but rather a means to the end. And in this case driving a 4Runner TRD is the end.Stfu and don’t be a retard. You know what to doIf you are into modding cars as a hobby, that car isn't too outlandish given your net worth, but you should pay it cash (or at least half of it) if you are still yoloing/trading on margin in your brokerage account. I don't think your monthly payment should be over $300 but that's just me.

I'm driving my camry into the ground (it's almost 9 years old, 55k miles on it since I dont drive much, and I should be able to drive it for another 50k no problem). When i got it my age was similar to yours, net worth was lower but I made more per year.Looks like a sweet ride, and Toyota is a fantastic brand. 

Congrats manI wouldn’t recommend it. I bought a 2006 Volvo sedan for $7k cash 6 years ago when I was worth $75k. I’m now at $3.5m and will do the same when this one car is done. New(er) cars are vastly overrated.You earned that money, now spend itBuy an old land rover defender and mod thatNo, don’t waste your money on a car. It doesn’t sound like you actually want it. Instead, it seems to be a whim.

Think about the bigger picture. Car is depreciating asset. A toy in your case basically. I’m sure you will find better alternatives that don’t cost as much. Also, the economy is not doing well. Chances are, things will get worse down the road. Save the money and invest or buy assets that at least maintain their values in inflation.[deleted]They got the nachos taco for 1.29.

It might feel like constant suffering but there is no joy without suffering. A divorce, losing someone close, etc only hurt so much because they brought you so much joy. Adventure on brother, it’s scary but a journey worth havingI used to feel this way, so I started to travel more and more and this gave me life again.

But this one has an apple logo so...if you're paying for apple services, App Store purchases, and SUBSCRIPTIONS there's no reason not to just get it for the 3%Get an Amex (as long as you plan on continuing paying off on time) or a chase sapphire reserve. Chase good bc the points are a little more valuable to me than Amex, but both good. I have an Apple Card as well as the other two, and it’s useless. Got it for the memes.

It's the decent thing to doLast earnings it didn't crash as hard as it typically does immediately after earnings, but it did crash none the less. If you have calls I'd offload them asap, stock I'd hold on to unless you bought near the top.Why not?Probably glitch.  TDA shows 104.35volatility will kill you once or twice and wipe out all your gains from the weekly sells. They are covered calls so you still make some money but theres better ways to invest 13000. 

For this strategy I would look at SPY a little more money and volatile but you have 3 expirations a week so you can sell much more against it with a shorter time horizon.

You don't necessarily need to buy 100 shares for the spy strategy you can just buy a call 6-8 months out and then roll the profits into another one 6- 8 months and not let the theta catch your call if its not moving into the money enough,

I started doing this right before September crash and still broke even after the elections.Do it. AAPL moves steady enough to make good $ selling CC’sIt’s kinda shitty. At 127 I sold a Cc for $130 and only got like $100 bux for it. It ended up shooting to 132 so i ended up worse off by the time it expired.Or use the same money to buy LEAPS and sell even more CCs.

Vanilla and smoky flavors that usually only come with higher shelf stuffEvan Williams bottled in bondAll of these mentioned are great! I want to add four roses to the mix tooEvan Williams bottled in bond or wild turkey 101.Best bourbon under 100$ is eagle rare. If you can find it, it’s 39$. 2nd place would be woodford reserve. You can find easily in every liquor store for 32$. 

They are both made under the Buffalo trace distillery. The same distillery which makes pappy van winkle. 

If you’re broke like most retards, then Jim beam black is 20$ and by far the best bourbon at that price point.

Weird, who woulda thought...Anyone getting the hint????From all the information I’ve gathered, steel isn’t that long of a play. It’s expected to go up due to high demand and low supply around summer, so get like June calls... Anything around August should be fine. I wouldn’t get a call 2 years from now. Just my 2 cents.Safe maybe but dont 3xpect to see any return in your investment until maybe a year and a half in. It will trade sideways and fluctuate a lot until then because no one knows for sure what will happen with the stock a year and a half from now. I would strongly suggest looking at calls for April and June for VALEhttps://youtu.be/7hhQLozezakYahoo Finance, any good broker, NASDAQ appBecause there’s a lot of SPACS and some takes months, even more a year to find a target... Your money might just sit there doing nothing at all. I suggest you find a good SPAC with a team you believe in like Chamath and hold those, still no guarantees. You’ll get like 2x return from NAV on average right before merger, but a lot of plays could’ve gotten you more...

SPY 420 EOMBullish.Market doesn’t careI bought covid calls🚀BullishPriced inlast time i did everyone laughed at me and called me ninja for monthsread a book on options or watch a course online. ur question is so wrong on a ton of levelsYou essentially sell the call at its new premium price and you take the profit on top of your initial investmentYou seem innocent... get off this sub while you can and come back after watching some tastytrade videos and reading r/optionsIf you’re exclusively buying options you won’t go negative.  Don’t ever think about the “other” side of the party if you aren’t holding to assignment, it’s completely irrelevant.  You buy to open a call, it goes up, you sell for profit.  That’s it.  They’re basically highly leveraged shares.  

Obviously that’s an extremely simplified view.  DM me if you have other Q’s.You can only can only go negative of your original investment if you are writing calls on shares you own.Thank god you didnt make a post about it.

If you buy a contract and sell it before expiration, you shouldnt owe anyone shares. You opened a position by buying, and closed it by selling. Remember, (buy to open) and (sell to close)   


If you SELL TO OPEN, you're going to put down cash to cover (sell puts to open) or shares(sell calls to open). But if you arent SELLING TO OPEN, then you shouldnt worry about any shares/cash you have to hand over at expiration.Some investopedia and YouTube videos will be wayyy better resources for this question

P.S. - probably just start buying stonkThis will help you;

Roughly 500 million in cash on hand and will have a lot more with the store closures 

Hugely undervalued at 1billiin Market cap 

And to top of all the fundamentals.... Possible setup for the greatest short squeeze of all time, hence the GME gang spam here and discords full of excitement.

Even without the mother of all squeezes happening.. With Cohen at the helm.. This stock ain't a meme anymoreCohenI’m with you, just trying to figure out what could Cohen’s strategy be.  Game developers are skipping the middle man (retailers) and any future game will simply be just come as any other soft wear product and update.  

Gaming continues to grow and if there was an applicable none brick n mortar distribution model other companies such at Netflix would have pounced on it.  I just don’t see it.  He’s done great with Chewy however they sell actual physical products (just making a spread on used and new consoles isn’t sustainable specially not at that valuation).

Oh well, Porsche gonna have to wait I guess 😩radPltr is up dogThis is why we hold til exp 🤣Get fucked kiddo. Sold 1100 shares @ 21, bought at 14.70.Should they call it the E-150 or will that piss off the loyalists?Yup, bought in 2 months ago and planning on holding for 2 years at least, cant go wrong with Ford if you hold long, their potential EVs can end up raising the stock prices substantiallyAfter your options expire probablyYou use a Samsung or Android phone don't you.

Nah maybe 4/20/2024not really, there's way too many other problems rn. maybe next.My massive TLRY position sure hopes soDon't think this year but I do see a lot of talks happening with it being finally done 2022 or at worst 2023 but with Democrats holding all three branches and many, many other countries legalizing it I don't see why it wouldn't be sooner than later.yeah, they need the taxes and to chill people the fuck out.Yes.   Democrats want to rush in with a win and sentiment for legalization is at a high, with other countries and the UN lowering the schedule of marijuana.  
Also at the debate it was mentioned as a top priority to avoid police using easy racial profiling with cheap tactics.   I don’t have much invested, but I think this will have a strong push right away. 
Will also be an opportunity for Republicans to save some face on something that most people want or don’t care if it’s legal or not.I bought fubo just a few minutes ago lmaoOld and priced inI have shares, I still like it until I hear from earnings reports (within the next 6 months) that the slack integration has been going poorly. I won't touch options on CRM though (well, unless I see a lot of volume/activity, then maybe), will likely just bleed for weeksWhat did you see huge volume on specifically?You’d have better luck with your fortune teller down the street, go for itThat's roughly a 66 percent jump in market cap in one year. You'd be in a much better position to do slighty OTM spreads and just diamond handing those for a year if you want max gains. Not saying it can't happen but that's a lot of growth to expect for a company as large as AMZN in a yearthinking of doing this myself. but it also ties up a lot of capital and may not go up much. AMZN can go sideways for 1.5 years before gapping up if u look at its price chart that is what worries me.buy under $60I sold mine!!BanBANYou have a pool? Life ain’t all bad!ARKK,ARKGICLNBOTZPBWHACK, cyber security etfStep one: sell callsSell weekly 1000c.You mean you have $40,000 in shares and not 40,000x shares I assume. 

If you don't have 100x shares most brokers will not let you sell only partially covered. TD won't let me, it throws an error

So I hold 100x shares of TSLA and during consolidation I can make an easy $1k a week when in consolidation. When it's skyrocketing I will try to wait for the top and sell an ITM call for maximum drop protection

But right now TSLA isn't going down and I'm afraid it will rip another 8% randomly 😂It’s pretty simple, look at sell call premium and that is your answer for each date and strikeWhenever TSLA gets near a $50 or $100 mark sell ITM calls then set a bid to buy it back for $20 less

It’s bounce back a little like it always does and you get free lunch foreverWell, no, cause you need 100 shares to sell a call and you only have 40k so it's not 100read some of Gary Black's tweets about selling covered calls on TSLA. think he tends to sell ~10-15% OTM weeklies after big pops

but also, if you only have $40k in TSLA shares that isn't even 100 shares, which is what you would need to sell a single covered call.Something something too big to failall the currencies r fuk therefore none r fuk?Go read The Accidental Superpower by Peter Zeihanyes go all inThey’re making an announcement about the announcement for their next announcement[deleted]TSLA at 852, so it will be at 2852 after announcement.I wrote in 2k stimmy for president so it should be 2kplease don't teach them math rnFirst month probably 1400 next month 2k.

\-Bo BurnhamNot really, your sell call is gonna eat up a lot of premium. You would be better doing debit monthlies.I mean they do... but some bullshit like an ATM long call and slightly OTM short call is just sloowwwww fucking money.

Figure your target price, timeframe, then figure out what's maxing your leverage given those constraints. Could be a striaght-up long call, could be a spread.

Very high IV, maybe a deep OTM spread with potential for 400-500% return potential makes sense.

The shale producers are increasing rig count, but slowly and not taking on debt to do it.

She stormed away but my frat brothers sure got a kick out of itThere is no way that this can actually be enjoyable for anyone involved.I figure at the end of this week I can probably make that happenCool if she's into itI had a girl who wanted me to, so we settled on in the shower. Did nothing for me but I am a hopeless romantic and can't say noCool thanks for the infoI have a few times. These chick and I were fucking drunk one night and I was railing her and had to piss bad.  So I said hold on a I gotta piss. She said do you wanna piss on me. This was the kinda girl where if you show even the slightest hint of indecision or lack of confidence she wouldn’t fuck you 

So I took he hand out her in the tub and pissed on her tits the came on them. She loved it. Was my first time and was wild. But the sex was insane and I thought it was weird but some of my buddies have similar stories. 

She wanted me to piss in her mouth but I didn’t do it. 

I say if she wants you to piss on her then do it. No biggie. Chicks like that are fun to smash.

Euro and NZ holdings were blood red today (and in the case of NZ, down again for “tomorrow”)Weight in the ETF is everything. Plug has 7%, do you know how many more stocks exist in the market that make up that other 93%? A ton of them and early today most weren't going up. PLUG is a meme stock it's on a different trajectory. It's just a matter of how much a stock is going up in the market at that moment and its ETF weight. That is all. No time delays, same as any other normal stock.There are these things called buyers and sellers that determine the price in the free marketAs I understand it there are weighted averages, etf share price reflects thatI would like to know as wellIt’s Thursday my fellow autist.Thought it was ThursdayPretty sure it's Thursday Jan 14its thursdayYou're obviously living in the future.

Take cuck bozzos away.Imagine thinking you were the one that told everyone about PLUG lmaoI had a chance on Friday. By some rando autist. Should of done it. At least my ICLN is doing alright. Waiting for uncle Joe to make a speech.Nothing alike.  Literally had no cares in the world in 1999.  US had no enemies (most were aware of anyway) and we were still the only super power.  Interest rates were also like 6% or some shit.  Way more optimism in general back then.Long way to go before we hit those days.  Imagine March free fall but in reverse.   Can’t wait for that to return.  This is a good ole fashion melt up in a bull market.  Stay strongOne day the dips wont bounce and bulls will give back all their money "dip buying" and then chasing their losses until you see a big fat fucking capitulation as WSB lets out a collective "Guh".Nah, Plug literally went to 1000, this is nothingSame thing happened last Feb 2020lmfao 30 to 40 hell nawLmao ford has almost 200 billion in debt.

Some fucker even said I was racist for lumping all China stocks as CCP controlled. Its a government, not a race of people. Fuck me. Vindication was so sweet yesterdayUsually 50%-100%. Let my FUBO calls ride to 150% today because it didn’t show any signs of stopping. I’ve definitely missed out on some gains by selling too early, but profit is profit & I’m up 50% on my whole portfolio since I started 3 months agoNot long50% upSell it, take the money... come back with an exit strategy next timeGenerally when I start asking myself that question.  I don't play weeklies.  I buy 3-4 months out, and if they make a bunch of money in month 2, I'm fine selling and finding another fish to catch.always try to buy more than 1 contract so you can Sell enough to make back your initial investment and then let the rest rideSell and rebuy something elseone way to hedge is to sell enough of the contracts that your initial cost basis is covered, then you're playing with house money and can let the rest ride to expirationBoth?No it looks like it will not go up for most likely the rest of the trading week and possibly into the next.

MACD : Flat on 5 min, 15min, and 30min. Downward trend MACD line coming off highs for the one hour chart, but has not entered bearish territory. 

MVWAP vs. SMA: The indicator is giving mixed signals, but is mostly pointed towards flat in the near term with the indicators crossing alot over the trading day on the 5 minute chart. On the 15 minute it does show that the MVWAP has crossed SMA which is a bearish intermediate term indicator. But on the 30 minute chart the lines have yet to cross and the price has yet to sink to test these level, which still does give us a more bullish stance. 

Volume and RSI looks to be pretty low as well and nothing exciting developing there. The NIO Day hype train was fun while it lasted but we have a lot of people taking profits off the table for the time being. 

So if you ask me, it looks like it will test some support levels at 61, and 59.50, before we start to see another rally behind it. Which makes perfect sense as it would be about a 10-12% retreat from the all time highs. 

So yeah, time to find something else in the meantime.

The thought is that the debt will reduce as things return to normal and as loads of people will want a holiday via air travel this summer should be very good for airlines.Fellow countryman here, bruv. KLSE doesn't make much sense to me. I don't have the data but the number of retail investors is relatively small, hence the real market movers are the institutions (EPF, PNB, KWAP, etc.). 

I've stopped monitoring local counters but if you see an opposite reaction to the overall market sentiment like you pointed out, chances are they're probably gonna release some good news in the next couple of days (maybe Gov free/low-interest loan or bailout?) and the big guys have all bought in. Same goes for bad news. Check out who the big sellers of AirAsia couple days before the Founders were investigated for kickbacks.

That said, right now they are possibly a bit high if there is a general market pullback. If they dip below $90 again I am going in on some LEAPs for next year, like $150+ strike

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

Rudeness towards other Redditors,

Spreading incorrect information,

Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s

Saying the N word without an N word pass

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.Who’s gonna tell him...Nice DDFor what? Weed dealers in east coast r at basketball courts😂 and bars or clubs for white and pills .

Date?? The most you can lose is the 100$ you paid for the premium, when it expires worthless if its still below the strike price...Only the $100 will be lostThe premium you paid for the option is the maximum risk, if the option expires below the strike price it will be worthless.If it goes to expirey still below the strike, it expires worthless.BanYou are not obliged to buy it. So when buying calls you either win with the difference or loose the cost of contract.if it expires in the money you’ll buy 100 shares at the strike price of 130, unless you don’t have enough buying power in which case the option will get sold an hour before close.

2) QQQN doesn't have options on Robinhood. I wrote this specifically for options play.

3) QQQJ has more liquidity than QQQN which is important when it's time to unwind.

4) QQQJ has more non-tech companies, which are still relatively beaten down and yet to recover, compared to QQQN.

5) All that said, if you're fine with stocks, then QQQN is also a good play.I'm so thankful I've found this sub. I've never lost so much money so fast in my life!

I had no debt and and my total monthly expenses were $1,250. I was saving 30% of my income into 401k and still yoloing for fun. Now just my mortgage is $1,250 and utilities and all that shit are so much more. So in short yes.That's what's stopping me tbh. Plus I like the freedom of renting but I dunnoI have 7 rental properties and it’s a fucking nightmare. Landlording blows and I’m not giving up 10% for manager. But have fun unclogging their sinks and drains and ant infestations and all the other gross shit that happens all the time.Because now you owe someone 600k you son of a bitch what do you thinkBuy a rental home first to split the costs, and then buy a home. Saves you a ton of headaches in the future and gives some play money after overhead is covered.It’s just so fucking expensive in ways you never even realize. I did not realize how nice it was to call the landlord because my garbage disposal was leaking and he just sent a maintenance guy to come fix it. A few months after moving in my toilet started leaking and i spent hours on YouTube learning how to remedy and the materials weren’t even cheap. I’m gonna sell and go condo route i think.Yeah fr.

I drive enough that in the 5 years I own it I’ll get to 100k or more miles. By then it’ll be paid off, worth 20-25k still, and I paid zero interest and the only expense I worry about is fuel and maintenance (oil, tires, brakes, etc)

Fully worth that to me

Because otherwise I’d pay a percentage of that in taxesI ask myself the same thing every day haha2.19 isn’t good?Wheel caps gains. I like unlimited loss/profit potentialAll gains.

So I short TSLA not because I want to, but because I have to.I used firm tofu, use a cheesecloth or some paper towels to squeeze as much of the water out in the sink, put the tofu block in the pan and chop it up with your spatula until it looks like scrambled eggs, add some nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, garlic powder, keep mixing over medium high heat until the sizzle of the remaining water quiets down. Pair with a tortilla or some plant-based sausage.Thank you broGuilty of selling all of my PLUG on 30%.

7.5c was opened on 12/30 with the anticipation of an ER run. Pussed out and sold half of em last week so I could play around with house money.

Might consider exercising if I can pull enough cash from the OTM calls. 9c is looking good, but the 10c and 11c need a solid pump.Agreed. I'm thinking of closing AMD for something that has the potential for 6-24mo explosion like cannabis or sustainable energy.I have 5 $21s expiring Friday and honestly don't know what to do either.

But looking at technical chart for PLUG,   extremely overbought,  so It will drop 10% from today's closed, which was $66,  to $60.i'm planning on seeing how it opens.

These big companies have so much bloat.Oh I misunderstoodIf it moves anything like TAN 35% is conservativeIt is, that's why shares are likely a better position. If it goes up 35% you get that. With the option, you'll need it to go up like 40% to get 35%.

Even the slightest search would've given you a wealth of information on what they're doing.

Canoo engineered/designed an EV platform that underpins two of the four models they've shown off. Hyundai was so impressed with it, they contracted them to engineer Hyundai's EV platform, who is also in talks with Apple for the Apple car. They've built 13 driving prototypes, and performed over 50 crash tests in less than 19 months (which would take a legacy auto manufacturer 3-5 years and over $1B) to do. Fisker, Lordstown and etc have done neither.

Jay Leno visited them earlier this summer. Yes, the vehicle drives under it's own power and Leno even drove it.

At $33K, the Canoo MPDV released last month is the cheapest cargo van in the market, period. It's cheaper than either ICEV or EV. It's 1/2 to 2/3 the price of the next cheapest EV van. Since it shares the same skateboard between all models, all R&D costs can spread across all models, and it can quickly and cheaply pivot to different cabins as the market requires.

Hopefully they keep going up- I myself don’t one any of them, so idk why I’m getting trolled; however, I have recommended them to some tradersPffftt ok. Carry onwards saltineGotta link politics to the market. Throw a SPY $500 in there somewhere.True. Thank youRodger that friendo I'll buy calls 2 weeks out give myself a buffer.Oh cool thanks man I’ll try that nowdid not know this I have .77cents in thinkorswim on some weed stock 6 yrs ago that tanked so I'm good 

So its `setup > application settings > system > quote speed `

then select `real-time (no delay)` thats the step?Lol nice tryNo problem! Good luckthnx, this was very helpfulOuch...I did the math tonight. Ive been playing options but to achieve the same result with shares I would have had to buy 2,000 at $5 (I tell boomers that’s my average)Yeah I never really liked the comparison to 1999 except for the euphoria part, this time around feels a lot more dystopian to me for some reason.  1999 seems like the definition of froth to me, this time around seems like the erratic pulse of a dying patient spiking up and down before it finally succumbs to... something.Ah looks like it’s called “margin maintenance” in RH under the “investing” options tab. For me it’s 20% below my baselineYeah I think it will, it’s been stuck here at this level for a bit bound to pump soonIs it? Doesn't seem like anything could bring this market down especially as the dollar continues it's journey down to 0.I don’t expect it to hit 35 but deep OTM usually have higher returns. I got them on dec 28 when the blood bath started lmfaoNah ima move it to tesla 1000c expire in April lolOh I can be assigned? Like I don’t have that kinda cash to buy 100 shares of Tesla. Guess that’s why I’m asking haha. I thought the most you could lose on a spread is collateral?How’s business busy? Those health hubs are kinda cool.https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/articles/the-vix-futures-curve-is-in-backwardationWhy 7/16? I have a 1/21/22 $30cYou usually get them at community colleges, 2 year schools where you can get your associates and then transfer to a 4 year uni to complete your bachelorsSPY has a direct correlation bruh. 

But really though, I’ve been taking this serious the whole time. Just pisses me off that this shit keeps rallying when it’s a fucking disaster out there.

Shit if my comment hurt you, idk what to tell you. Usually when I post the covid cases and deaths people comment “bullish” or “no one cares”Over time quality picks do, unless you’re a penny stock chaser or the world ends...Some do, some have rates way below typical investing returns, his hard stance on debt is purposely ignorant to please the addicts who are seeing the light of Dave RamseyAlso forgot to mention his complete hardline against credit cards, credit cards used responsibly are no riskI’m stoked people are taking steps to be responsible, if you’ve ever checked the YouTube comments you know people are fanatic about him, that only listen to him, and that bums me out, heard him tell people multiple times to cut fat checks (40-80 thousand) to pay debt where he didn’t even ask the interest. His advice is lazyMy unborn children would love meTyI agree...just keeping people honest. Because I know 99% of people cheering the Trump ban were also flaming with rage over the cake thing.I am a revolutionary, I want to smash the system with the assistance of these megacorps. Oh god no don't go near the capitol that's sacred!!!!I think you replied to the wrong guy.You’re right. Respectable. My bad broDuck it, I'm inK, was talking about cciv.Not bad at all 👏Problem is...it's just about their only consistent way to make money.

Diving into PLUG deeper...this is a real fucking shit stain of a company good lord lolI was not making an analogy. 

One can imply that the guy doesn't like the jewish. I was, in part, agreeing and stated why I was not fond of them.

I went on to challenge him by asking how a company is expected to go public if they can't IPO, and that it is ridiculous to consider it a jewish plot. It legit makes no sense.yeahhhhh I quit for a while and started again when I was working 12 hr days for the electionRight. She doesn’t sell down to exactly 10% because then if it goes up the next day she has too much👍TSLA is over bought and you know it, once the big boys dumb after they realize they don’t make a profit you’ll get fucked too!that’s why they’re called retards 👍when’s the video going up so 5 people can watch it?4 trill stimmy? u pulling shit out ya ass now boy, wait till you see what’s really gonna go down 🤠Selling them?Nice broThat's impressive, so far only managed to make $1k into $2k and scared to lose it hahaSeems short term options in general aren't cutting it these daysUgh great career and about to be a dadfind something that doesn't have the market cap of an afghani camel laundererthere are a few times it's spiked before, and it sank after

hmmOh so apple did infact say they were buying them or did everyone read that pressed wrong?Im in canada too and i think ive ordered like 5 things on amazon during thr pandemic (mostly pc stuff, which i could easily get from canada computers). I was on parler and most the people on there closed their amazon accounts and are massively pissed of at it. I think its quite easy to get rid of amazon, facebook is a lot harder to boycott imo. Il look for some metrics see what consumer stickiness amazon has. I could be wrong. Anyways il prolly throw a 1000 or two in some puts after i look into it a bit more.K. good luckThanks for the reply. I’m quite naive, and conventionally believed holding calls through ER was not a good idea yet I’m a complete novice. I’ll have a deeper dive, cheers.Cool. You know there is another side to that cycle and people can't be chasing forever, right?It is for 🐻🌈Haha I have the same high edge software telling yielding the same answer66k when it hits 1000? Damn maybe I'll just leave it to get more in the money hahaCheck out the spread at open tomorrowrofl ripYou're right. I think Europeans are actually taxed similarly to Americans and our healthcare costs are outrageous. 

We spend all our money on fireworks.Keep going daddy, my wife’s about to cum.I’ll 💎🙌 you broooooHoly shit is right broOh yeah, I agree 100%Why do you think politicians consistently out perform large funds and the market?Simping for Pelosi, LMAOiShares Global Clean Energy ETFStock goes up $5. $1.50 contract goes up $0.65. That’s a nice % gain. Multiply by the # of contracts I have. Not bad for a days “work”So make no profit for 3 months? That's old school thinking: have to call a broker and look at the news each night. Everybody can have any app now that gets real time updates, order book info, etc. I lost 10k in options first half of 2020 cuz I didn't know anything. Took that knowledge to trading shares only. 13k>20k October to today. Fuck holding long term. Momentum trading all the way[deleted]LikewiseWhat do you think about holding this vs FCEL? Was wanting to have 100 shares of that after exercising a call but idk nowProgressive brother progressive. And what better way to progress than buy FDs  aka the WSB way. 

Also looking at WSB being retarded is a gift not a shortcoming.Working at a “hedge fund” for free during college was the best decision of my life. Highly recommend.Ok boomerrip to my cold brotherAnnual percentage rate. No interest for a few years. Just go to the dealership and find the car you want. If they can’t get you below 1 percent start getting up and walking out the door. If they let you walk out over 1 percent they’re assholes. It’s an almost 60k car. I’d be foaming at the mouth if I was the salesperson talking to youAnd don’t tell them that you’re financing for fun lol. Always try to work out a deal. Dealerships will almost always come down on a brand new car. Less likely on a used one but shoot your shot anyways. Good luck!For sure.  Tough to be living fat on the coasts in general.  Bay Area is such a dump.  Wasn't impressed either with gigs I did out there.  At least to vacation SoCal is about 100x better imo.Thx u 4 ur cervix brøtherHaha yeah, and in fairness, I'm sure most Dems weren't looking that hard either.Ah yea that’s pretty fishy🍻here’s to hope, cuz I would love to totally ~~not~~ diversify into fintechIt didn’t price via Fidelity. It doesn’t necessarily mean they didn’t complete the offering via a traditional investment bank to institutional and private banking customers, which is why Fidelity didn’t get any allocation.I usually try to keep it around 50% options/50% (safe) stocks, and if the options rip I try to adjust it back.

After today, I’m like 90/10. Hoping it rips until about 11am tomorrow, then I’ll sell a big chunk.Of course! It’s one the essential staple animes!It’s nice knowing it’s there honestly. I’m play FCEL to lag follow PLUG. I’m doing well since opening that position in shares. The clean energy sector is going to be hot with plenty of eyes. There will be plenty of plays.Sunworks, similar chart to PLUG when PLUG was @ $15 and it’s been running. I’m only 20 shares deep but i’m buying more todayAlways man. I almost always sell half first regardlessDude, you are missing the point. It's not about the company. Is about CCP control over international trade if their stock.15A is rotary wing pilot? What’s 37ANei uf Swissquote. Corner besser?Bi aber kein klassische daytraderEh, yeah I mean. He was obnoxious and a shit talker for sure, but didn’t incite any violence. His staff would’ve no-go’d that the second he would’ve try. I do agree with protecting the tendies though. Would like to enjoy a life where the choices of the people in power don’t effect me as much as they do the poor’sJust using your logic. If trump organized violence, arrest him. But he didn’t. 

The other group on the other hand, welp. We know how that went. 

Luckily dems won so no more BLM. Racism extinct🖐Be rich over being right, just ride the wave and enjoy the tendies.Well yeah oil and gas will never be the same but the banks will be fineIronicOk maybe I need to read more about it. I like gas.I’ve stared at the chart too long today, have to buy it now.   Is back to pre covid level with earnings around the corner

Edit: a little more squeeze leftWell it's banned here sadly. I bought it after the offering but got exercised :( had to rebuy higherYeah, companies don’t want to train. Still, get the right keywords. Don’t have to be an expert, just know few things. Any exposure to AWS or Spark?Try working on some Kaggle competitions to gain experience.The banks don't want to get fooked if you can't pay for a repair, it adds up I guesshulu has all themCathie is still scooping shares, so there’s definitely still a chance. ARCT followed pretty similar price action today. Hopefully tomorrow it’s gonna be back the the regularly scheduled 🚀🤡Good luck friendWait message me haha I really don’t knowOTM you never expected to hit with 90% of your portfolio in calls on a stock that has NDA's out the ass & has no catalysts until 2 weeks before expiry. GotchaMight want to do some more research before making plays like this. If the stock price is in the money for the short leg (your sell) and out of the money for your long leg (your buy) at the time of expiry and you haven’t closed your position then you will be on the hook to buy 100 shares at the strike of the put you sold and the outer strike will expire worthless. This will probably put your account deep in the negative for a day or two because RH will automatically assign you those shares and you have to sell them at whatever price it opens the next trading day. Also there is risk that someone exercises the sell contract early for whatever reason and again you will be on the hook for those shares but that is unlikely to happen. But it certainly can and does happenYeah bro if ur asking in here...you’re prolly good to go and just do it.Even better kingYeah I find it annoying that we keep rallying during all this as well. Kind of unreal how little of a fuck people giveThat’s the point. Addicts. They can’t use it responsibly. You wouldn’t offer an alcoholic a taste of your drink.Yeah I would agree that’s ineffective but you have to realize a lot of his target audience are so beyond irresponsible that that’s the only way to motivate them. When you’re dealing with someone with tens of thousands of CC debt, expensive car payment, etc it’s going to be hard to explain to them “well, theoretically the market should outperform your interest rate on this particular debt so invest that instead” rather than just telling them to get their shit together and start paying it off. I know what you’re saying thoughWow you’re a badassGMNow I get to quit my crying :’)

Yeah bro, you got calls huhWell, hopefully they use that money on hookers and blow for company partiesI don’t see the comment ab jews that you’re talking ab. I must have whoever it is blocked lolStress is always a big trigger. Couple big advantages of the nicotine pouches is you don’t have to take smoke breaks at work and don’t smell like an ashtray all the timeShe is selling on days when Tesla is more than 850. Doesn't look like she is buying back. Let's see how this week goesTSLA will tie into all of musks ventures ontop of EV dominance, there’s more going on behind the rally than meets the eye..If he made money during the crash I'm assuming he bought themThat’s what I mean tho, I only started with 90 so I said fuck it to everything I did and it just worked out, if I started with 1k like you I could have made a shit ton but I probably would have been terrified to invest as much as well.Pony up the cash for ITM calls on a good company a few months out on a dip/correction. Be patient. Then profit.They must be making decent money or they would blowing themselves up ya knowUp 120% on the week o.oThat’s why I’m telling you to do spreads. The only way to make money with options is to get really lucky or learn to trade spreads.After looking it on my crap software, this doesn't look like a double top.

You may say a small pull back though. This is fairly bullishHey when tendies are printing, you may as well light some rockets🚀🚀🚀Because they have inside information. But there’s nothing sketchy about that purchase. She bought PayPal on the cheap after the market droppedAnd if you look at PayPal’s chart she actually bought pretty lateNo you’re just wrongIf you want to call someone out for illegal trades call out David PerdueOh wtf lol that sounds boring ._.You act like people have only enough cash for one positionThis isn’t the sub for you, this will just add to the craziness. You’re not even diversified with your only position in AMD. Check out the r/financialindependence sub for ways other people are retiring early and/or living happier more fulfilling lives. Good luck brother, keep your head up. Only one life to live.Click the “exercise” button on RobinHood, or sell the call and use the money to buy the sharestahts true i like this placdeThen hook me up bro. I wanna make bank.Joke went over your head. Go back to McDonald’s.Send helpI know what APR is, just didn’t know they did 0%. Crazy! Definitely gonna ask the dealership.Bay Area is a complete dump, yeah. Just soul crushing. Not sure what kind of gigs you mean, but if it’s music, I agree that the scene sucks as well. SoCal was where I initially wanted to land but work was up here 🤷‍♂️ Now I’m headed for the country 🛻😎HooahThey are insider trading prolly too lmaoI’ve done several IPOs through fidelity, this is the first time I’ve seen this message. I’ve gotten plenty of “sorry you didn’t get an allocation” messages, but I was under the impression that not pricing tonight was for everyone. I don’t think it’s priced by individual investment firm.Thanks
For the word pimp! Will check outOk sell nio that I’m up almost 500 percent on, got itYeah, I’m a Blackhawk pilot. 37 is PSYOP. have a selection date next monthmh isch mir sympathischer wills in prozent berächnet wird und Nyse isch chli günstiger aber müesst Swissquote no gnauer aluegeShit talking to people who are already angry hateful and racist carrying heavy weapons in paramilitary uniforms is equivalent to inciting violence. This is how people get mobbed and killed everyday on the streets. he doesn’t need to tell them to do anything, it is understood.Save you stream of consciousness bullshit for 4chanBut to be rich you usually have to be right about things, or so they tell meYou sold meDon't do it dude it's just an Uber without all the other capital investments...i just don't see it. But then again it's your moneyReally? Wtf. And damn :/ I do covered strangled on it quite a bitNo :(🤡 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡U don’t need it to hit the strike to make profit. In fact, Long dated OTM calls have the highest returns since theta decay won’t be high. In retrospect, it’s easier to think this way. But back in dec 28, it consolidated in that range for more than a month, market was expecting a Santa rally & had the perfect wedge like setup to blast off. There was no real catalyst for it go down in the last 3 weeks too so 🤷‍♂️

Edit: I don’t expect it to hit 35 now but back when it was in the 27-29 range in dec, was expecting 40 actually. The ROI would have been insane with 35c considering the intrinsic value they would have, the amounts of contracts I could buy leading to higher delta change & IV Spike at these levelsYeah so I guess I shouldn’t touch tesla Put credit spreads with only a 5k account? I just thought I’d they expired worthless I’d get max gain and if they expired ITM or didn’t go my way I would lose my collateralNice, let’s get that bread.Cool cool cool feeing a lot of heat for my remarks lol.

I mean that justification is the same as Fauci assuming Americans were to stupid to not buy all the masks, I always vote lead with truthyou're a useful idiot for tech billionairesEquity, can't buy calls on cciv bruhOh, I seeNot buying back is bullish because it means she thinks it will go up to ten percent again

I’m in NIO right now instead but just sayingReally wish I stared during the covid crash. Only 3-4 meme stocks nowadays🤡I’ve been playing with some spreads but no precise strategies per-se (Condor etc). With those recommended spreads do you have a % margin you would sell?Haha, this is a partisan issue for you, isn’t it? You honestly believe your chosen side is better somehow? Dude, they’re all shit. They don’t care about you. Fuck Pelosi and Fuck Perdue. Stop SimpingSure is but democratic admin coming in. Buyden’s already outlined a plan that will focus more on renewable energy. Shit is going to printLMAO I mean, I'm always tied up in something. Rarely manage to sit cash more than a day. Never have more then 20% in one positionI know how to, was wondering if you’d rather hold FCEL or Sun/wI laughed if it makes you feel betterWhatever you sayNah semiconductor work gigs.  Music scene maybe something it has going for it.  Don't know as didn't catch a lot of music while was there.Yup. Dems and Reps have more in common with each other then they do with us normal folkHow would it start trading tomorrow if the offering didn’t go through?Good luck buddy. Went to ranger school with a psyops dude, good fucking dude. Wonder how that’s gonna be with the captain that is under investigation for the riots in DC. I’m shooting for 18A with selection date in Aug. Godspeed.Well, it’s not the equivalent(legally speaking). He did not call for people to be violent. The legal consequences should fall on those who chose to bring weapons to the capitol, not the president. 

That’s why we have the law in the first place. If I go shoot someone because I thought you did something bad to me, it isn’t your fault. Even if you did do something really bad, you still didn’t shoot that person. Therefore, you shouldn’t be held accountable.

Edit: changed “bring armed weapons” to bring weaponsBe happy that trump is out, my man. Likely no more republicans are going to be in office after this. So there’s 4+ years of peace and harmony for you. Lighten upNot really? All those right people thought TSLA was overvalued last year are not rich yet.I don’t even have the appWhat about OXYNo biggie. Most shops have dedicated teams who handle AWS and Spark. These things tend to be large and complex. 

Just read up on Spark, what it is and why it’s important. 

As to AWS, look up Lightsail. This will get you a small Linux instance on AWS. Just get it up and running, put Python on it and run some simple script. It should run you $5 a month. 

You can then say, I am familiar with AWS, Linux...experience: mid level. 

That’s your stack. YouTube is your friend and build up your skill set. Lightsail will at least give you hands on experience - better than nothing. You don’t have to be an expert but present a good list of skills and willingness to learn, especially if you list Linux and how you stood up an instance.You mean besides algos & big firms pinning it between 23 & 26 to shake out the paper handed WSB FD retards until said catalysts?This is the same logic with put credit spreads for any stock. So I would recommend less volatile stocks that won’t have 10% swings or sell/buy very deep OTM puts for the strategy. You will get way less premium but it gives you more peace of mindYou know itI don’t have a Twitter or anything like that but we both know what happens when you assumeDuh. I’m dumb. Good shit thoLol what’s the username im curiousGood retarded tesla logicYeah, during the covid crash I was like...damn, everything must go up and it did😂I make small plays and hold them until close to expiration.Dude, it's not even worth it. Can't argue with someone who is so biasedShe is objectively not the most corrupt politician in power right now lol. It’s not even closeSo what companies are part of it? Shit mooned already kindaIt doesn’t.Basically everything here kind of sucks. Great weather and weed though 👍Did you Read the message?

PI is required by the SEC to obtain confirmations on indications of interest after effectiveness but before secondary market trading in Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO begins.  The Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering is NOW expected to be declared effective tomorrow morning, 01/13/2021 and trading in the secondary market will begin immediately afterwards.  As a result, there would be insufficient amount of time for PI to obtain customer confirmations and complete the allocation process prior to the security's trading in the secondary market.  Therefore, PI has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering.You too man, maybe I’ll catch you at Bragg this fallUnderstood. The law is the law. However mob justice doesn’t work like that. A similar case was debated in the courts before that’s why this is not technically a crime.  Kkk member got together and lynched people in the past, in the court it was argued the guy who pointed the finger was not responsible because he was not involved in the lynching. You draw a line where you want but when something as critical as this happens everyone remotely involved and looked the other way should be charged. People don’t understand how quickly everything can go to shit.I’m saying they have to go together not that you can’t be right and poor you tardI'm not talking about the app, I'm talking about the company. Uber has: ubereats, postmates, uber etc.

Lyft has...lyftPersonally i don't invest in crude resources so not rare earth metals/steel/oil.ok I'll check it out thanks broHonestly I don’t think the catalysts will matter much atm if it doesn’t plan to move since we have shit ton open interest on Jan & feb calls esp 30c. If the market has some sort of correction in the next two weeks, that would make things worse and will go sideways in the best case scenario. I do expect it to be 40+ end of febAlso I won’t be surprised if we hit the resistance at around 27.6 wed or thurs, fail to successfully break it and come back to 23-24 range. Will be massively fucked at this range.

But if we do break it, 30+ coming v soon<3, LRHR.

Plug and ENPH are top two. You also get some exposure to REGI which has done fucking incredible this year. Lots more too that I haven’t researchedYeah take hippie politicians over bat shit crazy ones have here so always positives and negatives.Yeah I read it. I’m not sure why you keep asking that. So PI pulled out because they didn’t get it priced in time to be part of the offering. It doesn’t mean it wasn’t priced with another bank. It specifically says it starts trading tomorrow.I’ll know who you are by your WSB lisence plate.Yeah I agree with that. I don’t agree with quite a few specifics of the law in these situations. But it’s all we got. Without a stern line then laws are useless, which it’s gotten so blurred in the last few years anyways. So yea it’s a mess“Right” here means TSLA will burst 1 day

You can make money now being wrong currently and still be right somedayAnd Tesla doesn’t even use gasAlright, RDFNGood luck.Oh yeah lol f that cornball he never has anything of value to add to the sub he stays on his bs I bet he doesn’t even have positionsKinda dumb he can still interact w my posts even tho I got him blocked lolYeah I did NIO as well and sold, now I’m holding PLUG I bought at 61!I can’t wait for futures to open, so I can start waiting for the pre-market to open, so I can start waiting for the market to open, so I can lose all my money tomorrow!Don't feel bad about missing the TSLA train last year.

1) Q4 ER is starting and banks will set the mood going into Q4 earnings in general. With low interest and the market run-up, it's expected that they're performing well. It's really if they can blow past expectations at this point and what management's guidance is. Just meeting expectation won't justify their company's valuation;

2) Biden doesn't seem like he'll have a honeymoon period with how polarized Congress is. While he wants to get a larger stimulus package out there, it depends on senators like Manchin, Murkowski, and Collins, who are as moderate as you can get;

3) Dec economic report wasn't that great. Manufacturing is expanding but the economy is pushing out both temp and long-term jobs. Important to note, however, that manufacturing is a leading economic indicator while payroll is a current indicator; and

4) Santa rally typically lasts a week after NYE, so starting this week, it's over. There could be a rotation or profit-taking this week.The next 4 / 8 years will be the greenest fucking years in the history of green.

now it's a fuckin weekly, and only worth 2.5. msft so flat that even months out lost money on options while nasdaq pumped to the moon.

What do I doNice another green week for Tesla 1000$ EOWThis is just spitballing so tell me what you think, but the user flair space is a pretty good spot to convey information which works cross-platform. What if we created a system that gave you, at a glance, 2-3 pieces of information about a WSB user?

Say, a 'WSB age' field, a comment activity field, and a submission activity field

Maybe something like Noob, 1-3 weeks, 1-6 months, 1-x years for the WSB age, then one of three emojis (ice, normal, fire) for activity.

So your user flair would be "3 Years 🔥 🔥" or something like that if you're both an active submitter and commenter. 

This would probably completely overwrite our current flairs or maybe allow extra text on the side. idk. Just an idea as to how we might address putting more eyes on the post history of people bringing information to our community.

**EDIT:** It seems like the most common dissenting response is "Yeah that's ok but I like my flair. Would a combination of still having unique flairs and the wsb stats be a good solution or do you not like it either way?My move tomorrow is to “invest” large sums of moneyAnyone know any pornstars that look like Nancy Pelosi?

**A**: My move tomorrow is **ICLN**

Joe Biden, with the help of a Democrat-controlled House + Senate, will pump $2.4 trillion into the sector during 2021. My prediction is that sometime in the next 5 years, **ICLN** will cost $300+ per share (maybe more). Getting it now, even after a week surge, is still an absolute steal. Get in now before the real pump happens. This is once in a lifetime opportunity, we haven't seen an infrastructure change like this since the industrial revolution. The dam has broken, and smart money, even oil companies such as Shell and BP, have already started pouring funds into the clean energy sector.

The energy sector is about to turn upside down and clean energy will be the only way to power anything by 2035.

Words of wisdom.These doom and gloom posts won’t age well by tmrwMan... remember the days back in like March when we’d watch futures together and they’d hit 5% up or down within a few hours? Those were the days.Anyone else get a bit scared when you see similarities between the dot-com bubble and the currently proclaimed "EV-Bubble"? Everyone seem to be buying EV-stocks and they pop up everywhere. It doesn't matter which EV-stock you buy, it will go up. Same as how people in the 90's just put money into internet companies because it "couldn't go wrong".

It's all about which companies will win the EV-race in the end, and there isn't room enough for all of them..Stocks will be either up or down tomorrowHERE COME THE BEARS SLITHERING OUT THE WOODWORK LIKE THE SNAKES THEY ARE\*markets down .4%\*

On **March 23** the price of **SPY 1/15/21 $300** strike calls was **2.07**. Lets say we used $20k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

SPY 1/15 $300 calls at the ask price of 81.10 which gives us a total value of:

#$811,000

no TA, no DD, no need to monitor Elon twitter, just blindly invest in a boring index on a dip and you can secure your retirement. Guaranteed by Jerome Powell^tm

The most impressive features are the intensity and enthusiasm of bulls, the breadth of coverage of stocks and the market, and, above all, the rising hostility toward bears. In 1929, to be a bear was to risk physical attack and guarantee character assassination. For us, 1999 was the only experience we have had of clients reacting as if we were deliberately and maliciously depriving them of gains. In comparison, 2008 was nothing. But in the last few months the hostile tone has been rapidly ratcheting up. The irony for bears though is that it’s exactly what we want to hear. It’s a classic precursor of the ultimate break; together with stocks rising, not for their fundamentals, but simply because they are rising."say what you will, watching buttcorn price action is entertaining AFTo everyone shilling Boeing puts.

That balance is Nio and Apple car gaining traction. 

So. At open I’m gonna wait for the biggest, fattest, green Tesla spike and buy puts for March. Somewhere in the range of 650. I’ll have to look at the prices. ($3050 with 87% volatility. Fucking gross.)I am strongly considering joining GME gang tomorrow. I’ve watched from the sidelines and resisted for too long now.Watched those Trumptards kill that cop with an American flag.

and then continue to watch futures go inevitably green through the night, whereas bulls sleep peacefullyTSLA is hellishly overvalued and overbought

Change my mind

Edit: the fact that the only response you all can make is "it only goes up" and "buy puts" should make you all concernedBABA $260 by eowFor those playing PSTH, I’ve been in for a few months now and there’s a pretty predictable trend;

PSTH should dip some tomorrow. That’s when I’ll be accumulating some more (probably more feb/June calls) . Small bump at market open then drift down to 28-29(maybe 27 but I doubt it). It’ll reverse sometime late next week and end with slightly higher highs next Friday at market close. 

Obviously, if there is an announcement this all goes out the window. ✌🏻Social security is an MLM change my mindThink I’m gonna turn $1250 into $4000 tomorrow :)New price target for nio from BOAWith all this PSTH shilling I'll certainly sell tomorrow.Snow in Austin caused a blackout. Currently charging my phone using my laptop. Hardly any bandwidth to even browse shitNIO is going to open at $70

GME has no solid fundamentals, their brick and motor locations are useless and their corporate culture is a fucking mess.

The whole entire thing is a fucking cancer shoot.Racist WSB freakout means NIO calls absolutely printingHonestly the only person that loses by caring about covid is yourself; so many are just not giving a sh1t and doing their own thing.

For example on Friday I sold my puts I had bought earlier in the day when SPY hit a major trend line on its mid day drop. It later went under that trend line and I jumped in on more puts because there was a chance we could drop a while until we reached the next support.

I sold those puts at a loss when we recaptured the trend line and bought calls and rode those all the way to above 380. All of that was planned by me. 

That's how I use TA at least.Anyone in on long TSLA puts?Is this a recession?tHe DoLlAr iS wOrThLeSMT is gonna go bonkersWhere do you view options stats and greeks before buying?

$GOEV will present at CES 2021 alongside many other new EV brands this week!
They will introduce their new consumer-model which might be groundbreaking (it's fairly new, cant say if it will catch on but they want to rent the cars without a contract with a single monthly fee that includes everything from charging to insurance).

Additionally, $GOEV is rumored to be the skateboard used for the Apple Car (via Hyundai's & Canoo's partnership).Pigs getting slaughtered Monday, and no doubt that includes the majority of those posting here on WSB.

Resident JPM intern downvote once to confirmAre 1/15s still considered leapsSector rotation to Nasdaq 🤪Nerds who hate section 230 talk look away now

Section 230 likely won’t be repealed because it would be useless. Repealing would have such a chilling effect on free speech if social media is held to The NY Times rule that almost every scholar agrees that the Supreme Court would analogize social media to bookstores instead of newspapers which would in effect give the same protection as 230.

The biggest issue right now is what happens to Amazon AWS etc. that is arguably infrastructure, and when infrastructure starts acting too discriminatory the court might step in. Amazon delisting Parler is somewhat like a public water company refusing to provide service to a white nationalist group. It’s going to take some new doctrine to get there but this does strengthen  the antitrust case against Amazon imo.Idk why but I have such a hard time spending money on myself..  Idk.

CHALLENGE UPDATE:

I took a very big risk trading QS, and have been getting hammered hard by it recently. However, things are not as bad as they appear, when you consider the insane amount of premium I am collecting...

My true cost basis is $65 - $5.50 premium = $59.5 / share. After selling a single weekly covered call, that cost basis will drop to around $54 / share. Each additional weekly CC will continue to drop the cost basis over time. Which means **even with the stock I own being down 20% from my entry, I would still end up with a profit.** That is the power of selling extremely high IV options.

Only if QS tanks well below $50, and stays there for months on end, do I risk an actual loss on this trade. I just hope that doesn't happen...

Tesla is actually going to open up futures down 6% 🤔Sucks my duck, bulls.Blood red fuckI kind of feel bad for cons. All they have left is downvoting the evil commie comments on reddit 😔Holy shit apple!First, flair me

Most of you are too young to know you had to be the first 3 commenters on the weekend thread to get a flair. Fastest fingers wonIve been trying to gain a better understanding of the bond market and its relation and implications to other markets. 

I understand that when yields fall this is an indicator and effect of investors higher demand for bonds and as a result bond prices rise. Generally investors are piling into bonds as a safe haven asset and money  flows from riskier asset classes like equities to bonds?

So if this is true then the falling yields during corona, should mean that money has been flowing into bonds, correct? 

I have a hard time understanding this with the background of the general sentiment that during corona investors apparantly have been piling into equities FROM bonds due to falling interest rates and yields in bonds? Thus explaining the huge rally in equities. 

The only explanation I see is that money has been flowing into BOTH equities and bonds during corona, because of falling yields and a huge rally in equities? Where am I going wrong?

Edit: I knew you were all retards already but couldnt think of another place to ask at this point in time.Holy fuk these futures. What's a good stock for the apocalypse?Okay i am trying tk help out my gf is there any weekly call that will return like 15% guaranteed next week she only has like $200 in her accountMake tomorrow red and the rest of the week green so I can take huge gains from selling puts and moving them into sharesYou don’t have to fuck with country music but Jason Aldean and Morgan Wallen are people you need to buy calls on[deleted]I want to buy this dip.. but what if it dips lower$BABA fucked tomorrow?I know Ken Kriffin the CEO of citadel.

The Twitter logo is BLUEIDK, the Dems were the first to go after tech this way in 2016. Silicon valley might just be playing nice with the new leadership but backlash over this might push some vulnerable Dems into action across party lines. The Senate is still pretty close.

Either way I wouldn't rule it out and keep an eye on the headlines.Humor me for a second, maybe the Dems do policy based on public need and not vendettas.Yeah baby print itttttt

Edit: I don't actually believe this but if some fucking time traveller told me that we hit 1600 by the first week of February, I wouldn't be surprised; these TSLA bulls are getting so eager and the FOMO is too real with Papa Musk becoming the richest in the world.I’m full tilt on TSLA shorts & hedged with some ARK Calls has been working well.

ModsChildren hospitalMeWhat price would be green?Is NAMBLA a charityPeople love their flairs. I don’t like the ban info either. Like why do users need to know thatI just ate so much buttThis is stupid.  Lots of long time active posters are full of shit and people who never post and just lurk can provide pretty valuable DD. Like if somebody is mostly lurking on here and then they take the time to post something then it is likely to be more thought out than whatever the average WSB dummy shits out his frito-hole.  If anybody is stupid enough to fuck their life up by blowing money based on what somebody posts on the internet then you were gonna fuck your life up by getting scammed one way or another anyway.Why can’t you just sticky a comment on posts from people who have no WSB history?Once the user is called out in the comments for their lack of activity/age of their account, I think our hivemind is strong enough to shoo them away, or at least bring attention to the fact that they're "sus"People earned their flair, and I think they won't want to lose it. Mods are gay btw.Don’t get rid of my flair!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥Feels basic for this sub. Can I also please get a change in my flair to “Patron Saint of Anal” or somMaybe - but I like my current flair I earned from votebot

I also like the ban flairs to mark the degensI like my flair. Has a subtle touch to it.I’m a 3yr commenter and DD poster of ICLN in November can I get some new flairpleas include penis size tooSounds like a good idea just make it super short like 5 characters. Just don't fuck up former flairsAnything for a flair daddyLoses the uniqueness of it

Plus people make alts that they use so age might not be as fun as flairs given

Edit: Ban numbered flairs are kinda pointless imo as it just crowds the good flairsCan we just use dick ascii? The longer the dick the more trustworthyNah man, stay true to WSB. Don’t go vanilla.

People love their flair.Separating new people from veterans at a glance would be nice.I’ve been here over a year and still dumb as hell. No one should listen to me.I dig it. Better than the ban flair at the moment.Any flair at all would be nice...I think the combination of unique flairs and those with WSB age/activity would be coolLet's do it. I don't post anything because I don't know how to make funny videos so I just talk shit. Have only flair to gain.I think its a great idea so we can more easily identify the gay noobsI’d rather have a funny phraseI fuck with this.thats a fire ass ideaI think that only activity should be considered with flairs, nothing elseYes both would be perfect thank youI would like a warning like only has ghey shares, or gme retard ectAny way for the user to pick 🌈🐻🐂?

Like the idea thoughYesSounds goodI’m down.I love it - gives a weighted believability. 

Kinda sad though to think that the “local virgin” flair guy would lose his. It sort of is the perfect flair for him tbh.Just flag PLTR holdersIf it gets this damn prison tattoo I got for mentioning something between a boat and a raft I’d like that.I like it1. imo a flair like "ball licker" conveys a lot more information on a person's comment history than how long they've been commenting. 
2. I think flaring users based off post age has the potential to create a bias where old DD is pumped and new DD is in the shadows never to be seen. 
3. For a sub that dicks on boomers all day, I think the last thing we should do is recreate their mentality in possibly shunning new ideasBetter pin biden tweet to fuk bears.I’m inGayWorth a test run maybeI'd say try and keep unique flair too but it's a great ideaLike it. Do the account age.  The other thing with I've and fire... maybe.I fuck with itWhat if people hide their flair?I like this idea, but I also like earned flair for stupid shit too.  Why not both?I like the account age and the activity levelFlair me daddyGreat ideaAll I wanted for Christmas was WSB flair. To answer your question this is meh. It's kind of a cool idea but the flair here is such a badge of honor, I'd say keep it unique.🐂 and 🐻 flair plsThis sounds cool, how does age work if I quit and re-joined at one point? I’m gonna look like a noob :(. Thanks for always working to make this place better zjAs someone who cycles through reddit accounts every couple of months, I don't really like the idea.Just the stats. Or...if someone has been here say 3 years or more, let them pick their own (within reason).sounds goodThere's a healthy chunk of those who are very active in the daily discussion but don't submit much, and those are further split between the pure shitposters and the play discussers. That system wouldn't be able to differentiate between those who are dishing out plays and those dishing out shitposts.Reminds me of when r/bodybuilding did a similar thing giving flair rating people’s physiques if they sent in photos.

It ended because it turns out some of the mods were passing around the photos and making fun of people.

I feel like this would be an even more autistic version of that, we should do it.- too much info crammed into a tight space

- if necessary, the info (such as account age) can be gained in other ways; no need to duplicate

- it's irrelevant most of the time because people can post their positions to establish their credibility

- flairs for activity incentivizes quantity. could end up having users polluting more to get flairs

- better the way it isI like this, plus what you put in the edit.I don't think I would like this. Getting a unique wsb flair is one of my goals. Plus if we cared about a poster, we can just check their profile.Current flair system already displays notoriety. A flair system like you suggested, in my opinion would dilute the current flair system and also, unintentionally create a hierarchy which would not benefit the flow of WSB.

I vote against.We need gain loss verified on flairI’ve been here like 4 years and never gotten flair, mostly a lurker but I’m a retard that bough tilray shares at the top after its initial run up, I’ve earned my place in the community.I told my mommy when  I got this flair so you better not take it away. I'd be fine with combined flair with time spend in this gambling den.No ones that hotDo you even remember Battery day bro?I like your big dick energyIt’s almost certain now, with motley stimulus headline, PT bumps, NIO hyping up EV, good stimulus talks, and blue presidency.

Can be good but not all the timeIf they change the laws there will be more censorship then since they could be held liable. You just went in a circle. Either way social media is not the press.

Advertisers probably dont like coups and murder promoting their new F150s...well bad example but u get it.People should try to take Trumps name and face off this issue because he is so inflammatory. Look at what these companies are doing and realize how terrifying it is they wield this power.how about the PGA banning Trumps courses lol. this is bigger than just social media. every industry that can , WILL take a piece of this pie and make good publicity from it. Trump fucked himself when he was at his weakest, there is nothing more to say. nothing will come of it.Remember when bakers were told they didn’t have to bake wedding cakes for gay couples? Social media doesn’t have to host terrorist.They are going to take away our shit posting.after this & what these wackos r still planning for inauguration, u better believe social media is gonna get regulated under full Dem controlMmm and who would push for this regulation?  Democrat controlled Executive and Legislative branches who benefit from leftist social media?He’s not articulate by any stretch of the imagination but he actually gets a lot of shit right.Being banned from using a companies software is not censorship.

But if I had substantial money on the line at this point, I would just set alerts and watch it like a hawk. The crazy price action could trigger a sell when it really isn’t what your trying to do with a traditional stop. Just engage your own stop in your head. Just too much on the line.A lot of brokers have trailing stopsThe bears are down 14-3Or you could just buy PLTR this week and have an easier ride to the top.

As close to a guarantee as you'll get.Go to r/investingYou could average the shares over a period of time say buy 10 this week 10 next week etc etc or just buy all in if you like the priceAverage in retardICLN. Better and consistent growth/movement with an ETF, and with new infrastructure, you’ll see massive growth by the time they see college. Apple will grow, but not as much.Lot to unpack herePuts on your mental healthIt’s not the acquisition or holding of tendies that eases the mind.

It is consumption.Breathe in fresh air my friendYo gotta get that gonorrhea taking care of bro! 

Go see the Doctor!!!It's simple. The CEO simply takes 100% of the revenue.Nope, ur right. CEO gets more comp than the company's entire revenue. 345,000,000 shares unlocked in March. SNOW is cancer in the medium term.It's actually so hilarious that the CEO makes more than the revenue of the entire company ahaha. IIRC it's all stock/options though so it's really just paid for by dilution.

I have no idea why dumb boomers value this company so highly. They are going to get burned so hard and then fuck outta tech stonks until they die and get replaced by someone else.Shit was manipulated up, I got burned on puts for a big loss in December 

I’m buying puts again on SNOW sometime in late Feb, but I’m okay with missing out on the inevitable drop because timing it seems impossibleMade a ton off snow, felt smart, then it took it all back from me.  In a week that stock can make you rich or send you to the poor house>It’s ... Its.

Will pull back before the next run higherIts the complete opposite. Everyone on here has been touting about how TSLA is gonna continue mooning on Monday. Majority of people loaded up with calls before Friday close.

And now there's a lot of people here with positions in it, posting trying to keep the TSLA hype alive1000 EODYes the company that makes half a million cars per year will reach a 1T valuationno way how do u do thisThis is the wayThat’s legit my favorite part of the game, the Lester missionsCommunism blah blah blah but Marx was absolutely and completely right about that. 

It always has been and always will be a class struggle. Other conflicts are just distractionsPoor people do it to themselves.Agree with this 100%

A progressive policy will address class rather than race and it will help everyone.

You do have to acknowledge that black and other minorities have gotten a worse deal however.

There has to be some policies to address that.Yeah this has been my argument for years now. The united states citizens getting along is Washingtons biggest fear.

Start with looking into the people who are digital nomads and where they base themselves out of; probably a good starting point for digging around.

Also look into where US Expats tend to end up.

If you don’t you continue to collect premium every week.If it were me, I'd maybe pull the initial out?Honestly, everyone who’s bearing in Tesla has been wrong... I’d just sell weekly covered calls and limit your downside further by buying puts ... just make sure you make more on the call than the cost of the put, otherwise, just sell your shares and move it where you see is best.

When the market sells off on scary news, that's BULLISH.

When the market sells off on no news at all, that's BEARISH.

Selling off on scary news means the weak hands, the stupid money, are panic selling.

Unless the amount is absolutely trivial, then it is pretty basedNo matter what anyone says, lamborghinis are obviously very nice. There’s a reason they cost that much, there’s a reason they are the “go to” car of choice when talking about being rich or getting girls attentions. It might not be everyone’s style, but anyone to say they’re ugly are just jealous people trying to make themselves feel better because they know it’s not realistic to ever own one.

Last time he shorted TSLA it went from $600 to $700. Then he deleted his tweets like a bitchEverything crash Even Market Crash so Burry is not wrongRemember how he was wayyy too soon for the big short?Just have to wait two years like when he shorted housingHe said so months ago and it never didAnyone can literally say anything in the stock market, and eventually it will probably happen. To get a good idea of who’s actually good is how consistently they can predict and be right. Being right a lot more than they are wrong. Burry has been announcing TSLA crashing for several months, and it’s still mooning. He got lucky a few times in the past and everyone thinks he’s a god. He’s making a fool of himself with his tweets, many of which he’s caught deleting. If you want to listen to him, go ahead. Personally, I also believe TSLA will crash, and so does many other people. But something weird is going on and it’s only going up, and no one wants to touch it right now. It’s ruined way too many bears. Haven’t you been reading headlines about the amount of money lost due to people shorting TSLA?

Just be careful man...You can be right and still lose money btw.BYE TSLAI'm too drunk to post my positions properly, but I've got 4x  jan 21 2022 400 put contracts since Tesla is a highly overvalued car company.You’re gonna spend 2k to shirt TSLA?Apple homers will still buy itI imagine it will be all smooth and curvy tear drop shaped.

Hype when there’s clear good news, which means yes it’s going up.

Or hype just because something became a meme stock and everyone is praying together. This one usually means it’s fucked, usually, not always.I remember seeing Tesla at $112 a share about 4 years ago.

If you’d like a more complex bouquet- I’d go with Captain Crunch with Crunchberries. The mild  brown sugar and vanilla undertones come out after the pleasant “burn” of highly carbonated citrous elixer and Crunchberries dance across the pallet. Though its certainly my favorite pairing to date it is reserved for special occasions, as the citric acid in the mountain dew     seems to “soften” the roof of my mouth and after only four bowls and three beverages it gets so raw the pain and taste of blood become too distracting to enjoy my fifth.

🤡🤡🤡I am not Chinese and I agwee. Gyna #1! No you’re the first person to think this ever.It's a bit different than pre-corona for sure. One of the reasons is the prospect of inflation coupled with no interest rate hike in sight, causing things to go a bit higher. 

The second reason is a surge in retail investor activity not seen in a very long time thanks to apps like Robinhood and a little thing called 'desperation'. This is a soft padding but with inelastic goods (shares of Tesla for example), small changes in demand impact prices quite a bit hence the erratic nature you are seeing.

For a third reason, and this is the most speculative... I think people were fearful of a big recession before corona. Now that we know something like a pandemic (and maybe even an insurrection) will keep stocks safe, is there really that much risk relative to return?you don't say/\>looks at TSLA's p/e of 1,600

FUNDAMENTALS DON'T MATTER

NEWS DON'T MATTERTrump loses real power in under two weeks, so no one cares what he does as president anymore (look at how little effect his tweets have on the market these days).

His supporters doing moronic things like "Click all the ads! It'll hurt Google and Twitter!" is a bullish signal.Bought twitter shares after they banned the Mango.I think the market favors hilarious shit like the president getting simulatenously banned from all social media. It's the cleanse we all needed after 2020.When lots of things are uncertain, tech simply isn’t. Regardless of political comes and goes, tech is fully integrated into society and it isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Pick almost any tech company (not memes) and zoom out over the last ten to fifteen years. Growth...plain and simple.You think the folks who live in Butterfuck, Oklahoma are the biggest consumers for big tech?Found the bearDon’t take that away from them. It’s all they got.It literally looks like they’re trying to loseNIONo one knows for weeklies, if monthlies, TSLA or ARKG callsNIO putsWe only down .38% simmer downI'd be buying way OTM calls on the New York GiantsChiefsBengalsRavensTitans, Tannehill is underrated, the offense is dominant, fix the defense and we moon!! Buying the dip after today’s lossZM is never a buy.  


TSLA is always a buy. 


And this is coming from an idiot who has only bought 1 share of TSLA ever and sold for a $90 gain in about a week.  
I am always 0.0001% away from FOMOing into Tesla, which means it’s only going to go up.  Until I jump in.I sure hope soTaxes were 35% for 8 years before 2016 and we mooned 300% during that time

Supply-side economics is a fucking joke. What matters and has always mattered to economic growth is monetary velocity.its  never been green recently with the dollar rallying more than .25%TLT has been sliding the past week. If JPow can't even control bonds, literally the one asset class he's allowed to buy, then there's no hope for stonks.Virtue signaling cucksThey believe their hateful bigoted actions are justifiable in stopping their perceived hateful bigoted actions of othersPure soy.Applauded?

Jack is getting his ass torn apart on the internet.You’re on the wrong threadSocial Jusice warriorsPlease don’t question the narrative citizen.Not liking kneeling and having Terms of Service expressly forbidding misinformation campaigns/inciting violence are two completely different things.Kaepernick was speaking truth to power. Trump is trying to rile his supporters up to overthrow a democratic process with force.who the fuck are youDude welcome back. Don’t say you support free speech or you’ll get sent to downvote jailBan again pleasenobody gives a  shitBan. Jk you didn’t miss shit. It’s the end of the world until it isn’t.Banlol sounds like you must have said something really dumbDude stop bragging so hard about being an engineer damnSlave away for 5-10 years and make some good options moves and FIRE then travel like a nomadDo the things you hate until you don’t have to is how that goes

Not an engineer but currently working in a high income job that I hate but it is what it isYou aren't bragging, you're whiningThere's generally a market crash every 10 years, so work for a decade, quit your job when it crashes and put all your savings into the stock market, you should be a multi millionaire 6 months laterI heard engineers turn gay coz they’re in classes full of dudes that don’t wear deodorant so they get accustomed to the pheromonesSlave away for a couple years and go travelI'm an engineer that's been making six figures for the past 13 years and I hate my life. The best my lifes ever been was when I worked in retail while in college. Sometimes I think about quitting my job and applying to work in retail.I mean you can pivot your engineering degree and go into just about anything else math/logic based. Make some money in finance, have some solid investments, and gtfo in a few yearsWhy not take a year out to travel once you graduate and get it out of your system? Then get your engineering job afterDo it.  Nows the time.  Otherwise you’ll be stuck in a cubicle for 20 years and wake up one morning and hang yourselfLive a comfortable life and put most of your salary into weekly calls in literally anything for a year. Then retire.

You're welcome, I don't even take fees.i said fuck that shit and now im living the wsb lifeTake 6 months off.  Travel the world.  By the end of it you will be ready for a stable job and friends.if you got that degree from a US institution, i regret to inform you that you know nothing about engineering yet. you’ll learn it on the job though so no worries.Life has a way of taking you where you really intend to go. Your present may not seem like that but if you put in the effort and make most of the opportunities that come your way you may actually end up achieving what you wanted to. You can not control the outcomes you can only control your actions. The moment you realize this and focus on your actions with 100% conviction you will feel free. That freedom is far more important than what people give it credit for. This is coming from a retard that got engineering degree in a foreign country and is now working in his 6th country.Huh...Bro engineers get to travel and work all over you dumb ass.. Literally construction nomads go all over the place and engineers get treated the best. Trust me you crying fagguette you wouldn't last a day doing the actual work you're better off flashing your degree at people and telling them why it's mathematically supposed to work on paper. such a kidFind a job where traveling is expected and see the world (or your own backyard) at your companies expense. Then go off on your own when you can afford it.Lmao as a professional engineer I can tell you your school experience is nothing like industryEnjoy the situation while it lasts. This either goes well or very bad depending if he passes legislation he promised. Then again, it seems the lockdown made it print for us so who tf knowsGuy can’t even spell the ticker right. I’m in!It’s AAPL you uncultured swineApply just trying to unlock meme strength with the EV shitIf that was the case a better company than Hyundai would’ve signed with them. Not sure what AAPL can add to make it different.Worse than permabears who started investing in 2020?He already had itHe already had itHe already had itHe already had it.🤦🏻

Asking for a friend.It's always peak euphoria after TSLA goes crazy lolits pronounced euphoriaManipulationReally no good reason other than metals being heavily manipulated. Good reason to own physical gold and silver. One day the spring will pop and silver will go from $25 to $150 overnight. Gold will go up a ton too but not as much as silver.

ICLN TO DA MOON🚀🚀🚀😵🤯I'm not sure you are understanding what free speech is. Free speech is the right to be protected from prosecution by the government for what you say. A separate corporation allowing you to use or not use its platform is not protected in any way by free speech.

I agree with you that it's a little worrisome but they have no legal obligation to let you say shit.You can speak freely all you want. But you aren’t entitled to use those platforms as you see fit in your own discretion.No one is obligated to help you spread your messagedo you not understand that the tech companies choosing not to host that content is itself free speechYou are welcome to stand on a corner and say things within reason. These companies don't owe you shit.Because it's their platform? if you want free speech, just go talk outsideWe really are fucked. You’re either too dumb to realize this and agree with it or your too lazy to careMy in-laws are immigrants who lived in the USSR before and after the collapse (Ukraine).  They tell me this movie looks familiarT...they give themself that power. We’re a capitalist country...so businesses can make their own decisions?  You can host and discuss whatever topics you want, you won’t be imprisoned lol.  Trump and Parler were banned for inciting violence. Your free speech can’t cause harm to someone else because that infringes THEIR rights. Whole “can’t yell fire in a crowded theater” thing.Twitter is just an Internet forum. Internet forums have rules, which they can set themselves. That the president of the United States chooses it to be his main outlet of communication is ridiculous in the first place, and now it shows. 

Nothing to do with freedom of speech. Everybody can still say what you want. Just not on certain Internet forums..🤡Free to speak as long as you aren’t mega phoning lies and inciting violence for millions of dummies to believe. Oh, and it’s also a private company and you’re using their service.Agreed. By shutting down their outlet, you don't pacify your enemies, you drive them to lash out even stronger.Your butt must really hurt to think that we care if you’re conservative.Yes on Reddit. Differing opinion = hate speech.Y'all releasing incel vibes, get fucked with your victim mentality.Whatbaby off a balcony?Links?We try to have ONE small violent insurrection and the libs are losing their shit and censoring usThey loved free market capitalism til it came for them lmao.Just build you own internet broSaturday: "We have many competing for our business"

The question can only be answered by you. Clearly, it’s good to have savings and not yolo it all on advice from a meme stock sub. It’s the level of risk YOUR willing to take. Clearly, there are much more stable investments with much smaller returns. This is a casino (with a Wendy’s in the back).Always, ALWAYS keep back up cash when pour.Keep 6 months of expenses in cash as reserve for bad times.Honestly wait for some big pullback. Current run, even if you expect a long term bull market, is beyond insanity/euphoric levels so any minor red day is likely to trigger a sell off (don’t expect something March levels by like a -5% week would be healthy). Have some stocks that you wouldn’t mind owning and sell some puts after a big red day to take advantage of increased IV/premiums and generate some income without having to use all of your capitalLook at the karma number we can confirm!!!!People in HERE claiming to buy leaps 9/10 times sell that shit within a week.

On one end - fuck Nazis. On another end - don’t tell me what I can and can’t say.A belt is a belt to me man idk bout that I’d buy a nice jacket or watch or shoesAfter looking at the price of those... absolutely not. Unless there’s a whole belt market you know about where this can be an investment that appreciates in value (similar to watches or baseball cards) then please don’t spend that kind of money on a belt lol.

On the other hand - if you REALLY fucking want it and think it will make you happy then get the thing. But don’t fall into the trap of consistently buying shit because you think it will make you happy... hedonic adaption always wins and you’re typically left not really giving a shit about the thing after awhile (this doesn’t seem like it will be your issue since you have trouble spending money on yourself).

On the other other hand. No matter how much money I make, I’m still super frugal and spend my money practically. If you’re not like this and have the money and want to spend the money and it won’t screw with you financially then fuck everything I said and get your leather straps son.TSLA calls dudeYea man buy the beltyolo. every year you have one less birthday.pure paper handI mean I sold a couple of things in my Roth Friday but damn just hold and hedge and keep cash on hand or something.be strong brother 💎👋 zero or hero🦸‍♂️You will regret that decisionYou’re pretty retarded if you think ICLN is a shitty, overbought meme.

We have moved from the previous censorship of objective calls to violence into new territory. Change in regulation=more censorship. They’re scrubbing more and more off the bathroom walls and eventually people are going to assume that what you don’t scrub off is what you stand for. If you scrub nothing it’s clear that your establishment doesn’t align with the writing even if it is subjectively wrongI only use Trump because he is a very easy example. Like I said, I could give less of a fuck about the politics surrounding the issue. But now it’s pretty undeniable  the tech giants are more powerful than the government. How we continue from here is unknownBanning trump, so hot right now!Exactly, but if they choose not to host terrorists, they need to be held accountable for said terrorist posts, no?In terms of stocks, doesn’t matter.

Hyundai partnership came out last week and more details and confirmation came out this morningAlright I'll parlay steel ml and over for 200.  Time to get some gains for the weekend.


Psth please keep printing next weekDon't get me started.  That thing was a lock, I thought.I mostly tell people I don’t give financial/investing advice since I don’t want to feel bad or have people be angry with me if they lose moneySell the news....Your guess is as good as mine. Idk, maybe because investors will come to their senses. Then again if economic policies remain its really anyone’s guess 🤷‍♂️Because the gov isn't propping it up once it's recovered and then it will be clear all the earnings are overvaluedIm in both arkk and arkg and man after like almost 2 weeks of red days, 2 green days made up for the losses and then someYeah, and by then i think i couldve made much better gains with MARA or ARKFOk what about next week then?probably EOD or EOWPussyThat's not even an 'if' lolbeaver love?Thanks to everyone who replied.

I’ll go with selling 100 and keeping 200 for selling covered calls.ARKF and ARKG are the only ARK without teslaDid you buy a charger with you enlistment bonus?Poor manYou can only import cars that are the same as American models that have already been safety certified.

So we got jobs and no hurricanes. Proving your point useless.Thank god. Its too crowdedHe’s probably citing the 26 year old Boeing plane that went down in Indonesia. Sad story but there’s a reason why Indonesia has a major plane crash every year....One of their planes crashed right as it took off in oingo boingo country. They did not fuel their 🚀 enough.Another Boeing crashed yesterday. Most likely due to bad maintenance on the part of airlines, but I don’t think retail investors would think this through since it is bad publicity for Boeing again.

Hyundai Motors (and Kia) double down to invest $87 billion into GOEV over a span of 5 years to develop smart electric vehicles, with an ambitious goal of over 25% of total auto sales being electric vehicles by 2025

Hyundai Motors just acquired an 80% controlling stake in the creepy robot company Boston Dynamics

Hyundai is working with Apple on "Project Titan", an electric vehicle project. Will GOEV be involved with Apple's smart car?

Apple's smart car is projected to hit consumers in 2027, and be sold as an "experience" that changes our perception of auto travel. Think if Steve Jobs achieved ipod level creativity and success with electric vehicles

BlackBerry has entered a deal with GOEV to produce for their cars the ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) aka the computer/software of the car

Now imagine it's 2027, and the first fleet of autonomous, electric smart cars hits the streets. Branding by Apple, sold by Hyundai, designed by GOEV, programmed and secured by BlackBerry.

Subscription based smart electric vehicles.Well there is a 'business update' tomorrow...with negative news it might be your chance!


There is also NCLH and RCL, which could be better opportunities. I'm married to CCL because I've held since May...so I have to hold for tax reasons...CCL had 8 billion in October, now they SHOULD still have a year left. There is still dilution potential though, so who knows...If it continues to climb I'm definitely going on a cruise as a celebration. I'll be 21 which means I can go on the cruises by myself too!Haven’t bought yet but getting as many $80 calls as I can tomorrow🍄TSLA bears been out in full force since market closed on Friday and TSLA went down 1% ahI feel like it reeks newly rich or low rich.Tacky does not mean ugly.🤦‍♂️BruhWhat about VALE?The message is be modest. No need to kill yourself financially and physically to impress people you won’t see decades laterSome people do prefer renting and having done both, I can see the argument for renting long term. There’s pros and cons to both bro. Houses are a pain in the ass, anytime something breaks it’s on you to fix it and pay for repairs, you are lighting money on fire to property taxes and mortgage interest so the argument against rent is kind of moot, and the whole bUiLdInG equItY argument is retarded - houses are not a good investment, likely to underperform the market, and very illiquid with high transaction costs. Only buy a house if you really want one, never because you think it’s a good financial decision. Ask any wealthy person and they will confirm thisThey’ll find out when taxes come around 😅Nah, not everyone. I’ve seen million dollar homes on auction sites being foreclosed and sold for cheap due to job loss, divorce, deaths, etc.Not for stocksI used to tell the ladies “I have a three inch dick and only last a minute.”

This isn’t the caseI feel like my social skills have degraded beyond repair though.It would have to be a cash covered put.  Can’t use shares to cover a put.  So you would need $5K for step 2.

TILI like where your head is at.I very much appreciate the thought that went into this response and knew that this would be the right thread to find an expert.But it aint. With rates staying near 0 until 2023, AtATs high debt suddenly is a huge benefit. They have massive cash flows to pay it down, while paying no interestOne-time dividend. Does that hurt call options since share price goes down the amount of a dividend does anyone know?Which one would you recommend the most Xpev or NIO?

I've been around long enough to see this happen time and time again and I do not think itll end well for call holders (and the whole market tbh) this week. Hard run ups inevitably to lead to hard profit taking and people that think TSLA is exempt are going to learn the hard way to take profit where you can.This is what I’m thinking, I think we go to $32 tomorrowBeen in since units and agree, the only comparable pump was that one day there was the bloomberg rumor, and that was even less on a percentage basis.TrueI mean, it’s not a hot take or anything.

I mean Petco is IPO’ing this week, or also check other stocks in the same sector like Zoetis, Freshpet, Elanco, Trupanion all of them are killing it (well ran yes but a growing industry).  Video games are probably growing even faster HOWEVER GME’s business model is broken. No one buys physical games anymore specially not in a store. As per consoles most are purchased directly or via better ran retailers.  It’s simply a broken business model.  There are so much better companies why invest in a lottery ticket.> This means something and I must know what

I'm incrementally investing like that in dogecoin because I've been feeling froggy 🤪Crox at ICR tomorrow at 930am. Coupd be some price actionupvoting is hard work palSecond half of March I bought half way back in to indexes (up 60%). I saw we were trending back up and wanted to get in at least partially. The other half I mixed between theta gang, day trading, and buying fucking spy puts as a hedge (up 30%). 

My biggest regret was buying fucking spy puts with half my money and then having to dig my way out of that or I’d be up 100%+ on the other half instead of 30%... or 1000s of % if I bought calls instead...

Theta gang dug me out of the spy put losses lolFirst time in response to corona videos I was seeing from overseas, I knew the “it’s just a flu” the media was originally pushing was bullshit. It wasn’t just Trump originally pushing that bullshit it was everyone lol

I also bought a house with only 3% down in last January and am up over 10% on that... 

This time I think it’s from vaccines being overhyped and us being in complete euphoria. Everyone I know is recommending stocks and cryptos it’s insane. I also think that Russian and Chinese disinformation campaigns are going to tear us apart.Both. I think we are in clear euphoria. Everything purchasable is going up. Retail investors are almost tapped. Even my homeless brother is buying shit on Robinhood and giving me stock advice. 

Also, the divide in the US will only get worse. This is a byproduct of Russian and Chinese disinformation campaigns. We are playing right into their hands. As we continue to become more divided we may even see an invasion of Taiwan by China or continued invasion of Eastern Europe by Russia in the next couple years.Why?Can I change my flair at least lolApple should go to the 140 MarkRIP bearIT'S A CAPITULATION BROIt's not, he would've told me about a situation like thatTruly the worst outcomeRight, but they just set themsleves up to enjoy permanent non-support of 30% of America. That can bite them later and is going to hit user counts.No but having 30% of the country angry at you is still a short term profit hit as they switch and a legit long term legislative threat. Also butterfuck, OK businesses advertise wherever their customers are...LmaoThose are the delayed results, check investing.com.   dumpppppingIv is probably like 300%

I’m going with Washington football teamSo if the nfl would’ve said Kap violated their code of conduct policy by kneeling everyone would’ve been cool with it?But the first amendment doesn’t guarantee your right to “speak truth to power” without criticism from a private business, just the government right?

I know it's sad lolActually did that for a while.. took a year off and moved to actually and just did volunteering work while traveling around the country and loved it.

The universe freaking scary for real...I like that perspective.. honestly been feeling like I’ve been fighting against “life’s path” for a few years now..Ik, I would say I’m pretty aware of the opportunities outside of “education” as an engineer.. and I’m not bagging on it it’s a great job (I’ve had multiple internships and have seen a broad range of jobs and opportunists).. just genuinely feel like it isn’t what I want to doI just sometimes find myself wishing I didn’t have the aptitude for it so I didn’t even have the option in the first place..They are literally just fomoing EV.

TSLA is going to be the straw in the S&P as well.  All those wanting the market to stay this hot haven't seen what happens on the other side.

Most of the retail traders have little stomach when shit goes bad, and they don’t have the bank account either.

No one can tell me this isn’t because of stimulus checks hitting people’s Chase accounts and everyone is like, why not? The fed rate is so low there is nowhere else to go to make returns, but it cannot keep going.37.5 expiring next week for now.

Why do people not understand that the 1st amendment actually doesnt mean you can say anything...Got plenty of shoes and jacketsHonestly, I just enjoy getting classier designer belts. Something like Hermès would likely keep its value to some regard but I’m not looking to sell this item. It’s more of a personal pleasure then not. Shoes and belts, I’ve stopped growing and already have an extensive color list for pants, belts... not so much, shirts I could careless, I have some collectible items but mostly I just wear plain white T-shirts and whatever color jeans I feel like matching with my shoes. I like the fact that these belts are reversible and last forever. I’ve spent plenty of money on crap leather belts that end up trashed in a year plus. Honestly higher end belts only get better with time if you care for the leather. I’m mainly looking to add a new set of colors into my color way or belts.

I doubt this would financially ruin me. I guess I’m just trying to justify spending money on myself for my birthday. Just a single male with nothing available to do for my birthday so any money I would have spent on pre-covid activities is saved because I’m incredibly limited to what I can do, obviously everyone is.Check futures.

You sound like someone living in peak McCarthyism. Simply suggesting you guys got it wrong makes him a shill too now?

What did King George say?!hope it was a genius power play and u got paid 

cause if notI was wondering why the daily was so well moderated. ThanksI bought some last week at the dip and up at 10 percent. Probably pull out mid week once I feel good about the gains.So just buy all the LEAPS? Would it make any difference if I bought ITM or OTM?What kind for ICLN?Lol those hours are insane.good luck u got this20 hour days??? How are you still fucking aliveI’m in it I just want moarSame"Best" would represent the majority's consensus though.Kinda confused on the answer you are looking for. Alot of people are buying calls due to the stimmy pump and hype around the country going green. Calls = lots of risk if stimmy doesn't go through cuz potential dip then expiration.. Stocks =  less risk due to no expiration and lower volatility?Did not see that. Thought it was this year. You’ll prob make tendiesI'm down 10% atm.How?It is an ETF that traces the the fairly predictable VIX index or VIX index futures for your option purchasing pleasure. You can go short and long on VIX using UXVY, VIXY, VXX, VIXY, SVXY, VIXM. Each are designed to hedge for different timeframes.Oh like you think it will hit somethingGet rich off options you’ll get tons of puss puss. Chin up kingDoesn't matter, Dems love their regulations and conservatives are really really pissed right now. Like appease the masses level pissed.

 They'd like nothing better then to call it a monopoly slap them with antitrust lawsuits and look like the good guy.

I could totally see them taking a swipe at FAANGCambridge Analytica and disinformation was a serious issue in 2016 elections.I do agree that that's a big problem.I guess more risk based because if multiple stimulus force the fed (unlikely) to raise interest rates that will be the focus of 2021 and 2022 leading up to the midterm elections.

I don't think it matters per se and they'll pass a stimulus. $2k seems like small potatoes. Go big and give out $10k per personYou're rockets are kinda convincing, but why not CMC? :Dwhen it’s not subway ima find all of you and fuck you with a six inch extra mayoYea I’m good with whatever honestly. Every rumor has been a solid company and ackman can’t go wrong. I just want to see it within the next couple months otherwise I gotta push my calls out further again, and I really don’t want to sell them and pay the capital gains.Worth a shot LOL300k of it is on marginGlad it's nothing like that. I wouldn't wish it one anybody. 

I'm not going anywhere but to tendietown with my fellow autists.That theta tho😵Man and I thought $1080 eow was pretty retarded...I dunnoI see. What happened in September?Nice. Respect for putting your money where your mouth is. I think it’ll pay off. I’ve only got around $4k in this one but will probably buy more.Sorry... Was treasury yield... not too long ago this was in the .80% range. One of the measures to keep the printer brrring is low inflation, this is inflationary action

There's also been a treasury yield rate increase past 1%, but not finding the link for that. Basically they said the fed might have to step in.

EDIT: changed to treas yield > 1%I bought another call when it dipped to 38 briefly but still holding $30 2023 calls tooTicker?Maybe it’s time for another paper trading competitionPrint("Gang Gang")Maybe not in your area, if you are rural but it’s the most in demand fields. Overall.More than everything else regardless. STEM is always in demand and can go non-traditional routes far, far, more easier than a sociology degree.Political Science and Gender Pronoun Engineering doesnt count.Pretty much.Check other historical delisted stocks. I'm guessing it either pays out or gets zeroed. Probably dependent on if you can trade the stock after delisting announcement but prior to actual delisting. I highly doubt it'll happen though, NYSE already refused an EO to delist other 🇨🇳 companies.Same stressful division happened in 2016 post election. Idgaf what side you’re on man (I’m conservative) shit moves forward. Honestly half the shit that’s going on doesn’t effect your daily life so don’t stress out about it and just view life’s problems in general as cars riding past you while you sit on the side of the road. Don’t chase the cars don’t try and stop them just let them come and go.It’s always been this way. Now though we have two groups of people who can no longer agree to live peacefully with a shared set of values and each side is playing for keeps until one is flat out destroyed.Idk maybe... I'm holding nio for the long haul though so I just see it as a buying opportunityIn my early 20s I barely felt a hangover drinking shitty vodka all the time. I started feeling them in my late 20s. Im 33 now and they are brutal. Im scared of what older hangovers will feel like. I also drink daily so that doesn't help.I'm impressed. That's either a long time to remember a lot of knowledge you don't use or a lot of studying. Or both. Either way, good luck on your new job.Obviously mine 😬Yea but TSLA actually movesI'm playing ER too and have  1/22,1/29, 2/5, and 2/12. Mostly in 1/29 and 2/5🤙I honestly don't know, I'm waiting to see what TSLA does tomorrow; if it's flat and premiums drop, I'm thinking of jumping into calls, if red, I might wait and see how Tuesday goes; my goal is to play SPY 0DTEs tomorrow :DThis is Wall Street bets not loser football fan bets.

I’d be figuring out a way to check on it at work. Good luck though! Not trying to freak you out. You’ll be fine!It's just a flavor of stop lossThat's weird afDon't have one, good genesIt never is. 

I’ve created enough wealth that my kids kids kids kids would never have to work (if I had kids). And it’s still not enough to keep me out of the muck every day. 

I’ve had to train myself to self-care, because when I break down I break down hard...and then I’m no good to the gigantic pile of people that depend on me to be sharp and effective every day. 

Set goals. Meet them. Reward yourself. That is the healthy and sustainable cycle.It grewYou have it too? Fuck I’m jealousThis is true, 400k for a house for me, that was 360 at the start of the pandemic and i closed thinking “glad I got it at this price”. Appraised 10k above closing price 3 weeks later (it’s brand new)I remember the last time buyers said thatlove u boobooThe saddest part is that a shitton of the support would go to rural whites.

They think everything is a zero sum game and don't understand an economy growing together and everyone getting more tendies.

They think getting rich is taking from others.Detroit? Islamabad? Kabul?We were exhausted and decided not to move. Prioritized and bought back our shares.I struggle a lot with psychiatric issues and I do believe cannabis helps cope with them. However, I've tried to quit several times unsuccessfully...Oh I’m sure NIO is getting a huge pump. But I think a lot of it will be premarket and I think NIO will open too high with too much premium to buy calls once the markets open. But if you’re like insanely ultra crazy bullish and think NIO is going to moon even harder than TSLA has recently, then I guess go for itI’m for sure buying in at a NIO dip. I’m uncertain if there will be one. But the premium NIO will be at open is not worth buying NIO at open. Unless NIO is going to pump like TSLA has been recently. That’s probably the only way it’s worth it. I’m just gonna sit out and watch. I’ll buy at dips if there are anyYeah at the age where its still kind of freak stuff people die my age from but imagine it gets much worse.And they’re expensive enough. I can’t think of another ticker with that volume/premium thoughOh so nonsense then? I've seen thousands of technical posts between here and stocktwits and most of them were wrong. I don't see how it's any different from picking heads/tailsOn $10 or $10,000?ah. then i assume i’ll be getting it tomorrow 9:30amA Lada.When it prints I’m taking profit, for right now it’s just a waiting game. 18c are probably smarter and will still give nice profit but I’m all in or all out on this one lolu/zjz this man gave 2 golden fuckboy awards pls give him a flair :(Just tell me what to short lolSorry JamesAfter being up over 100% the past month they’re down 10% today. 🙄They trade at less than 2 P/E even if 💩🪙 "tanks" all the way down to 28k. I will cum if we get a 33% dip to buy.Some days, the food bank is like living large. Other days, it’s just crap food.Ah so you too are a man of cultureya green is good, pot & energy.  no way green new deal happens this year though maybe 2022/23 if things are going okSeriously, it all tastes like shitYesBothdidn’t know ackman controls V and MABased. Man, I sure fucking hope soDigLike Apple?OofStrike?I don’t have options settings. Just the option to downgrade to level 2Thats probably not goodYes and its going to SOARI'm holding UCO and USO

OPEC cut production 
Banks aren't funding new explorations
Alot of oil companies are still below profitability
Industry massively shrank
Over all supply is being cut
EV market isn't replacing vehicles at a fast enough rate to offset current demands

TLDR: Supply go down, cost to find new oil go up and harder means price go up. Even Cathie Woods highlighted this happening in her recent podcast 

I expect oil to trade atleast $70 a barrel and push to over $100 so the existing companies and countries can exit strategy to fund new investmentsI'm gonna take a look at SLV again. But funny money is correlatedI have quite a few TSM calls and was thinking of getting more, but the IV is kinda high going into this weekI’m fucking sorry I reminded everyone. Imma go #ropeMLK day my guyWhat’s a good expiry for the LEAPS?Oh yea if you’re talking shares just hold that shit. Short term idk seems to be trending down but it had a good run end of year. Probably hit 60-70 soon tbhWow he just set one up“yes definitely” he has stressed on his Chinese identity instead of Taiwanese on multiple occasions so…Because Tesla the company cannot possibly hope to meet the valuation of TSLA the stock. The market has at this point priced in TSLA owning more than 100% of the EV market.If it gets posted here all day long followed by 🚀🚀🚀🚀 it’s a memeYes obviously I know about the Hyundai thing...what is the added news over the weekendIll be watching and pulling for you.holy fuck were retarded hereThe only thing I’m worried about is inflation, but inflation is needed after the crash last March so maybe it’s not a problem. I just can’t see the economy recovering then immediately crashing again.If interest rates stay low/zero I dont see it dropping, where else can people put their money? HYSA before march were 2.30% APY or more now they are 0.2%I’m never holding anything through the holidays again lmao, lost 60% of my gains and got them all back afterMeant never loved but beaver love sounds funnierI can't afford one im poorMy wife came home and said have you ever listened to that song.  Holy shit.  Creepy.The only Dork is the Dad that can't seem to find anything in common with there Kids.It should dip this week, Along with IV. But I’m not sure how low it goes, I’m buying if it goes below $16 cuz Cohen bought at $16, but who knows it could go lowerSometimes i will buy if the price is right earlier, nothing specific about 1030, just choice. You likely will pay a premium if you want something right at 930 (sometimes you can find deals tho)The reason they have a profit is because they sell carbon credits. They also have way less volume than any other car company. Shit’s actually retarded this bubble will burst HARDHow much did they dip?Goodthat is why invest in the deflationary currency (Orangecoins)lol okay then I guess everyone who predicted TSLA hitting 800 was wrong because they predicted it too early. Shit logic!RemindMe in 1 monthEh not if you make bank. Bears get so much shit but it’s very possible to make good money as a bear. People on here act like you always have to be bull or bear. But why not be whichever one makes sense in the moment? So many permabulls on here acting like it’s a bad thing to see an overvalued asset and bet against it. Probably because they think it’s easier to just spam buy calls and hope you aren’t the last to fomoTy. They are tiny openings. It’s weird. I hope I can still find loveGod speed, retardJust gotta figure out how to get around all that camo. Hopefully they got good programmers.Go back to the fucking grave Bernanke, JPOW prints harder and longer than you ever couldSuggestion?I hear u/cashflow_ has an inverted penisI definitely took profit. Short term i had 1/8 60.5s made 200%ish on those. “Longer” term. I have a bunch of 1/29 60s, 3/19 57.5s, and 3/19 60s. Up between 100-200% on those. Will trim the 1/29s aggressively into conference rumors this week. And keep the 3/19s to play takeout/earnings. 

EDIT:takeout *rumors*Whats dollar tree protein powder like?That’s what I’m doing, there’s speculation that’s it’ll be 25-35, if you like the way the company looks then you could even hold past then. Idk, not your financial advisor

Buy the rumor sell the newsI have 1000 shares at $11Theta gang can hopeI tried waiting for a dip but it never went down. ICLN is looking like a good long term hold especially with Biden.


- Position: 9 shares of ICLN. no optionsI bought it as a joke.  Kept it because it's awesomeI’ve got 60% of my portfolio in ARKK. I just want some solid, consistent gains. I’m going boomer style.Of course not kingGot money on the over or under? My producer probably put money on them. Who they playingAgain as a non footballian—good for them! Hope they take out the packers at the super bowl (or can they not because AFC and something something.... I’m trying man sorry)P bullish to me ngl the plane was old af means they will need to buy a new oneI think it's a long position to hold. They've bottomed out as much as I think they will, and at this point, it's whether they decide to stay in business or not. I'm pretty sure they will, so it's just the long game.

When they bounce back, we'll clean up.how do you see corn?I would love a transfer to the US honestly, hoping I can do that with my company. You guys seem to run steady and pay well. 

I don’t work rigs or anything though so I have some decent job stability. Covid really hit hard though.Official news of signing deal with Hyundai for iCar by end of the quarter.EV rumors. Apparently there are talks of a partnership between Apple and HyundaiBetween that and what Q4 expectations look like, I would say we see a massive run through the month.Bubbles always pop eventually. It takes a while tho. And then you buy that fucking dip and do it again. 

Bubble has a long ways to go before popping. We’re about to expand green energy on a global scale that’s never been done in any sector at this rapid of a pace. EVER. 

The depth and breadth of this green energy expansion is the largest in history, by like 1000 fold. It’s gonna be a rocket ride for a while.Same hereThat's a really interesting question, and I don't know the answer. I will say that I just paid $5K for historical options data, after writing code for months for my new bot. 😬

You are correct that volume is a signal worth examining. I haven't really backtested it, though. I'm not sure if it's as strong a signal in predicting tops, as it is in predicting bottoms. I think declining volume on a multi-day selloff is a good predictor of bottoms. We saw this in March 2020 and March 2009. The idea is this: bottoms are formed, not when buyers come into the market, but when there are no more sellers. When there are no more sellers, the only direction is up. 

It's hard to get good intraday volume data.Ya Burry bets money while Elon builds multiple multi-billion dollar companies. Know who I'm going with.Blue or pinkBasically every stock is a bubble right nowI think it’s because the event was turned into a giant media circusif i run you over with a tesla, are u gonna blame elonFlorida man lives there and this guy ∆Tydie CCP scumBruh...that’s why i said itI hear that! It's how I started (multiples of 9) and rounded up to 100. And I've heard varying things about Robinhood, either that they just pay out the warrant or will actually let you convert. I'd rather convert if it's a good merger, but don't know what to expect with Robinhood, everybody's favorite broker.ExplainNice I'm thinking the same thing. Hold shares through merger.  Get that money man.  Let's hope for a good weekBan post screenshotGood question, no answer yetA vulture the size of a small two seat electric vehicle.

It swings to 820 or below abandon ship mate

And buy the dip laterLiterally google everything about their Q4 and iCar. I’ve explained this to 7 people on here today. No one fucking researches this shit anymore.i don’t remember either reddit created it for me or i was fucked up when i made itIt's when he got banned and for how longEnough DD for me, what’s the Sofi SPAC?But what’s the SPAC ticker for it?Looks like bug fixes and improvements but who knowsI got mine after I updated the appLMFAO 29.5B on < 1B of Rev?

I’m sure it’s gonna include some green stuff in there.I read it was set for Feb 11th.ya BA is a tough one, should rebound in the commercial planes but assume defense cuts coming in new adminhow long u think the dip gonna last? a one day type of thing or all week?Thank you for the tip. Much loveHmmmm

I’m hella long term bullish on GOEV but got impatient losing money on it everyday for no reason. Might have to buy back inMake sure you get 100 stock so you get some on board credit with whatever one you cruise with.Go higher bro. If your buying two years out buy higher strike prices man.Ah, sorry. You’re right, didn’t really think about what you said. No it’s not tacky (in my opinion). Tacky either means cheap or bad taste. Lambos aren’t cheap and taste is subjective. 

Overall, tacky is a bad term to use for a lambo in my opinion. You either like and/or admire it, or you don’t, but you certainly don’t ever talk it down because it just screams jealousy.Which is why I went on to say the second part. And also a million dollar home ain’t shit these daysDon't worry, so has theirsYou might be right. I saw one of my friends who lives alone for the first time in 6 months this weekend and his social skills were so rusty I don’t know if he’ll ever recover. Pretty sadI feel you, homes. This year fucked up me, but at least money was made.


We just gotta get vaccinated, head back to the gym and build our confidence back up.I agree and I think Tesla is overvalued but the guy needs to shut up because he has much of a clue about Tesla stock as we do....okay?Per contract I guess. Was looking at June expiryno they don't lmaoWtf does a price target matter if you don’t know the valuation you are getting on the companyThat was a really risky clickGod you're autistic 💀I have tlry and nobody talking about itAnd don’t forget PLTR lolCorrect. TSLA is like a hybrid. It’s a meme stock, but it’s also very real.Thanks good sirNo problem bro. Im glad to help. Im  gonna try the recipe u/kangadoood put out there. 

I feel like it could be delicious but the window of ideal texture is limited. If the original recipe he put out is legit, I’d like to through some poprocks in there...really try to engage all the senses. Not so much that it overwhelms the palate...enough for the dewmeal to still feel carbonated.Yea but their revenues are on a decline unless hbo max can offset box office revenues, hopefully they can dump directtv and raise cash to be able to compete with Verizon & T-mobile which are ahead in 5g.It's available at Total Wine.

Yeah.But for what reasons?Sooooo puts on steel?I find it sad that people actually believe this 

Take Uber and Lyft's valuation, add it to the next 9 major automotive manufacturers, and they're collectively still worth less than Tesla.thats fine and all. but...to be the only company selling cars? you're smoking some shit.God told me soThat’s hilarious, X gang!How do you know?Blue senate was 100% unexpected and hasn't been fully priced in yet thoughLmao, mine is way lower than thatwhere do i look up futures at?It'll actually be cheaper than that by JuneThis is the wayI’d love to see that (though I’m not opposed to a dip).Dw power will be back up by tomorrowLiterally none of these are an inverseWtf are you talking about?I hope you’re right but I was playing it like earning. Buy the rumor sell the news#IV crush enters the chatThere’s a DD post here that explains it. Basically their filing is unique and in favor of investing in shares. For every 9 shares you hold post merger you get at least 1 or 2 more warrantsThat is retarded.   Do it yourself lmao.  But the oldest boy who plays siege said the connection has been more stable with no hiccups and we have like 20 devices connected at all times.  1gb fiber line fyiThe app that comes with it is super simple and easy to use. Can see alot of the traffic going through each device, etc. I believe when you walk away from each pod, it connects you to the closest pod. Cool stuff like that. The only drawback is that each pod only has 1 ethernet portPaper hands — close your positions with a loss at open, or...wait until mondays power hour and close your positions with profit.  This is merely a dip to buy. Crash isn’t happening until late Jan early febAll of that was secondary to how his license plate looked.Funny you mentioned that, buddy of mine moved to MA for a couple years so I changed my registration to that state to save on insurance and inspection on my all manual Toyota Corolla.  This was when I was very young, humble beginnings.HIGHER CHAD!!And what about his bet on Herbalife?

That being said I still have $10k in PSTH because of the SPAC hype.No way in hell will it ever drop below 400A lot of reports of "brain fog," inability to concentrate, and headaches, with symptoms lasting several months. It's still too early to tell if it's the kind of thing that will just clear itself up given time but seems to be affecting enough otherwise healthy people that I'm not going to put myself at undue risk. I'm trying to make money and retire while I still have some youth left, leaving myself mentally 20 years older is counterproductive.

Sorry to hear your mental health has been struggling.Literally just a slight cough and feeling tried for a week. I understand it’s tough for people who are obese and over the age of 75, but if ur not in those categories it’s better than most coughsSeems like PLTR 27-28 has been fairly safe the last few weeksI did sell my NIO calls and my BABA stock (both up) but the BABA calls were already down 80% so I figured maybe there is some upside. I think I've learned not to buy LEAPs that  cost more than $2k--but I'm about to buy some SQ leaps that cost that much tomorrow I think....I really love the semi’s this month. NVDA AMD TSM MU

That’s my recommendation. I’ve got about $600k in leaps and calls across those four tickers rn270s for feb and 300s for AprilWell the IV crush that people talk about is when idiots buy way OTM options around earnings for which they pay a lot of premium due to high IV. After earnings, even if they are right in their directions the stocks doesn’t move enough to cover the expected move so they end up losing money as the IV volatility, and hence premiums, collapse after earnings. Of course, the opposite can happen where as market had a expected move we’ll below the realized move and that is when you make bank or lose a lot if you’re selling premiumOh damn, count me in!Steel Dynamics (STLD) is said to be producing the cybertruck steelMeanwhile, Cleveland up by three touchdowns already lmfaoBut will it thoHow much does TD charge per trade?You're finethat's messed upBeen in THCB since $10.70 try again

Or do you think you're the only one capable of original thought.Hmm...I'm clearly too transparent with my wordsJokes on him, my wife stole thatI’m trolling, obviously you wait til it pops then by calls. I was saying QCOM is currently nearly double the price at the top of the bubble. So if TSLA follows the same trend, 2040 is when it doubles in priceIt’s different this time 💎Ban for suggesting banIt's generally a bit volatility my dudeDawg USA is not Japan, just enjoy the ride for now. We got two years of free money and basically 0 interest. What’s the catalyst for a huge crash like last MarchYeah, don’t get in at open$30 April expiration 😎But uncertainty not good thoughNo we said puts> Stripe chief executive officer Patrick Collison squashed the rumor like a bug on the sidewalk.  

https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2020/12/pershing-square-stock-will-find-a-merger-partner-before-its-deadline/amp/Well that’s convenient for everyone trying to pump it as a Stripe merger when everyhings pointing to it not going that way. Theres no law about them talking about going public, and the founders keep saying they have no intentions of doing that anytime soon. Can you show me something that points to it being Stripe aside from you wanting that to be the case?Prolly a good idea. i think their earnings report is Feb 18th.Neat. Mines a 19, grimmspeed j pipe, top mount, boost control solenoid, intake, inverted bilsteins, bunch of other stuff. Love the carNo, just small.>$QS

That's what I think as well, as that's exactly what my TA Bot says.Hang in there. The people you need in your life aren’t always who you think they are.I was locked up for one day does that give me more cred than Akon? Holy shitthat press release is from Wednesday: https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-proposal-enable-online-sports-wagering-part-2021-state-stateThats a good play, thanks. I'm in.I sold some $20 1/15 GH IV. Can’t believe there’s ppl that stupid out there lmaoBut let’s be real the returns unless you have fuck loads of 100’s of shares are terrible selling covered callsSo brave. Live your truth broRoku has gone up quickly. It will probably max out then dip in a week. They’re not TSLA.Yes, me too. But amazon isn't splitting.But it you didn’t have any🚀🚀🚀But why though?Eh I wouldn’t touch it with a ten foot pole unless it crashed to March levelsSPY will drag it down with it. That is usually the case when SPY diesDepends on if you think people will genuinely give up that tech because if what’s going on. Outrage is fickle and normally short lived. Full disclosure, I think Twitter is a cesspool and only good for finding things out real time and otherwise it’s just a sharks vs jets circlejerk. FB is just where people post crap for their families or just share random crap to other boomers. Really full disclosure, AAPL is bae. But also I hate it when it stagnants for months for no reason!That’s under that assumption that each and everyone one of them is going to completely boycott the companies in perpetuity. It would be generous to even say that 0.5% of republican voters will never do business with big tech forever. 

This then also touches on the point as to why the market is ATH while the economy is in the shitter. Poorer people are shits out of luck at the moment, but those with good jobs have continued to earn well. Vast majority of great jobs are in major cities, that are always predominately democratic. 

Someone from Butterfuck, OK is extremely unlikely to buy a Pelaton, as opposed to a person from San Francisco.If he violated his contract and they let him go that's fine.  If he's within the bounds of his contract then fuck em let him do his.True! Doesn't mean people have to be ok with it. Power dynamics also come into play. Twitter is the David to Trump's Goliath, here. Same as Kaepernick to the NFL.It’s joe Biden’s America. Now we support corporations ultimate authority!! But only on removal of free speech!!!!For 2020, same. No shame.Ah. In that case finish your degree then use your maths skills to live off stock market tendies and become a nomad hahaThis is exactly what i am saying. Our intelligence is too limited to grasp the workings of the universe. The best way is to control the controllable and be blissful.What happens is we try to make sense of our future based upon our present and discount the changes brought in by the consequences of our actions that are yet to happen. So you can not really look into the future. Focus on your preset and take charge of your actions. It’s as simple as that. An apple tree will only bear an apple , it may be late to bloom but if it’s growing it will definitely bear an apple.Well try this out for size my company got bought by a much larger company and I got 150k in straight cash. Only had been there a year. If you’re actually smart and get to a good company you can make good ass moneyYeah lol. I’d buy one but let’s be real no one is gonna have the same kind of self driving innovation and other quirkiness of daddy 🍉6 1/2Of course. Zip locked baggied to maintain freshness.Getting more comfortable🤣🤣😍Oh shit LOLKk fine at least 2 to 5 baggers, happy? 😂So we should nationalize facebook?Easy, communicate the same way you use to before they existed. You sound entitled. At the end of the day they are a BUSINESS  and a BUSINESS can decide who they offer their SERVICES  to.Because they only have that power because you use themI did that for the firs time in a while yesterday and saw a robocop video.When your company basically controls speech, ya. This isn't a mom and pop bakery.

But glad you are ok with big tech deciding what is ok for you to hear. Don't like it? Stay off it. What's the problem?Not being democrat = hosting nazisWas able to get Feb calls for $25 a while ago and I’m rolling in it. I believe it’s gonna keep printing hence more callsThank god I was out at that time (sold for a small loss a month before), got back in after.

I told my dad to put all his money in VRTX, good thing he never listens to me or I would have been disowned.Oops I thought he said gravityyou're thinking of *charles* dickensWell if you get back in I'm the proud holder of 12 calls total.  Half 110 and half 105 02/19 monthlies.

Earnings is the next week after that expiration.

If you eventually make the mistake you’ll think of this comment and be like ‘holy fuck, he was right’This is a true cetaphil user, nobody buys it without cringing at the price. I’ll keep that in mind thanks famJust would assume they will have a hard time making money with interest rates so low for the foreseeable future.

I actually don’t know about that but I assume it works the same way the buying price is. So yeah I bet The interest doesn’t change until openThis is WSB you clown. This is for gambling and good luck using rationality in this market. 

BANLmao all good brotha. That’s what we autists are here for. For “guidance” 🤡They didn’t even respond though. That’s disrespectful as hell. I agree Tesla has been doing good steady grinding but they have some major issues with quality to this day.

I’m 33 and feel like 44 but that’s because i was born and raised in a country in a different country. I’m a proud American now. I’ve been drinking sorry about the sentence structure and misspelling lolCuz market at ath basically moving money from cash to stonks. Falling yield = expectation of more monetary stimulusNah I don't. Just a wife. Seriously tho man, if you have that little touch should not be risking money in the stock market. This shit is vicious. Only play what you can afford to lose.

Hope you guys get shit figured out and can gain some savings. 

This sub is fun and I love gambling. But I'm not gonna if I lose my trading funds.Alright then ill let you on the SLV train hop on were on our way to 15% 🚀🚀🚀🚀One of the best.

SorryGo back and read our discussion again, but slower this timeShould exit on Wed or Thu the lastest to avoid sell off Fridays.Ummm probably 50. 
I’m holding shares now. I’ll buy into leaps for next year if there’s a dip again.Honestly, alive just not well. I sleep through my weekends and then right back to the grind. Gotten used to running on 2-3 hours of sleepAlso this is Wallstreet bets sir this is a casino...❤️Oh well, give it a year and you’ll be doing just fineGot it so I wanted to hedge for 2021, which one would you recommend ?If you don’t know what Call Options are, that’s an entirely different conversation .By or before a certain date. That's what options are. Calls are betting it will go up from where it is, Puts are betting that it will go down from where it is. Calls are the option to buy, Puts are the option to sell.

Each contract gives you control over 100 shares. You don't own the shares, but you have the *option* to purchase or sell them at the strike price. You also have the option to sell your contract to someone else, which is how most options trading goes down.

Read up, my friend, there is money to be made and lost!Stimulus in 2020 seems to have barely staved off deflation. I would be extremely surprised to see CPI go above 2-3% in 2021. Rates aren't going up until we near natural unemployment again.just one of the founding steel stock of AmericaOh my god whyyI’m saying people here are panicking easily retard, not that we’re definitely going green.I admittedly probably bought too early. I could see it dropping down to $15-16 if tomorrow's a red day, but we'll see.For perspective, the 10 year yield was between 2-3% for most of 2011-2019. 0.80% is extraordinarily low, historically.I mean if they don't want the dollar to go to 0 and lose all global purchasing power, they're gonna need to do something to offset the printing lol raise taxes, etc.S-c-r or t-s-c-r-f. Still otc in US but they have Canada's most popular sports app and second most popular in the US. Deals with NBA, Penn and other casinos to open up sports betting as it's legalised across us states and Canada which largely has bipartisan support to raise tax revenue for all the covid expenses. They have like 500 million users monthly and are uniquely positioned to have betting inside an already popular sports app.

Doesn't have to get anywhere near dkng to payoff big time, if they do end up competing with dkng then tendie heaven.

I have 27.5k shares and will probably add more.I've always thought those were great.Yes that’s the statistic, but there’s more nuance. For example a Biology degree in generally useless unless you get more education

The market is retarded and will react to news like Paris because retail investors can't think more than 2 weeks in advanceYeah.. I’m missing something, I’ve always had this.You're a true American patriotThey typically make money off of AUM and other products. We are so used to doing our own trades that we are like "wait what why would you have someone else make your trade" - I lifted the below off of a popular WM firm just to illustrate how they make money from the above.

**Representative Assisted Trade Fee**$25 additional per trade*Flat-rate commission and fees apply*Didn't the markets drop like 15% or so something 3 weeks before Battery day?

Love them, but I miss so much of the game cuz I’m fucked up, talking to people, just doing whatever.  If you actually wanna watch the game, TV gives you a better experience, you can’t argue with that.https://ark-funds.com/subscribeI appreciate the help. Even if I get dicked and it ends up selling at 830 or 820 a share, it’s still life changing money. I’m up over 700% from what I bought them. If that dips to 650% yeah it would suck, but I’ll be okay. I’m going through pilot training right now and our flights can take up to 6 hours, can’t really be on my phone in the plane hahaMaybe it has to do with the volatility.

It depends on how much you want to pay for each contract.But ICLN has had quite the runup lately.

Gotta have something safe and consistent.I don’t bet on sports anymore and I am a lifelong Browns fan so I would never gamble on my team.They could actually.  Browns (AFC) beating the Pack (NFC) in this Super Bowl would be perfectly reasonable after this year.Sounds like a plan B)

I also think IF there is some correction, we are insulated being in the travel sector!Nice! Didn’t hear about that!Good to know I'll be on it market openYa, I’ve got exposure to ICLN & holdings within. I may add to some positions that are already +100%. I typically sell half my stocks that I’m +100% on and let the rest ride ‘house money’ forever, but green energy will be huge. I’m keeping my eye on Commonwealth Fusion Energy coming soon.

I haven't contacted them directly about it. I do use rh, but I own my psth shares on tda just in caseEvery share you buy comes with 2/9 of a warrant, to be received once you hold through the merger, so for every 9 shares you buy you will receive two warrants post-merger. The warrants will have a strike price of $23, if I understand correctlyI'm expecting some up and down until a merger is confirmed. Since I haven't heard any news yet, I'm not convinced we're gonna hold 30, but I'm always hopefulhttps://i.imgur.com/2uS4JoI.jpgFight me for itSorry for picking your brain for your opinion. down voted..It's a ban day - you were banned on the 10th of December 2020 for 2 days (1 bans total)

I was banned on the 6th of October for 35 days (1 ban total)InterestingI want to learn sports betting have you made some tendiesNo idea my friend, but I'm still long the market. Could go tits upI’m guessing you Called it a split because those places have pen of 50%. Lots of beatable games but so much heat these days which leads to travel. I was lucky enough to have a hole card game last me a year at my local casinoI'm all in Carnival Cruise so I clear the 100 stock bar. I bought in late April so you could say I saved the company, I deserve some on board credit!!!It’s just a year out and that’s the highest call option they have listed on robinhoodMulti million dollar homes ain’t shit either. Not many ppl are in the market for them, so it sits for years waiting for the right buyer. Then, when selling, might be for a significant loss. 🤢Thanks for the pep talk, I'm ready to go get them now 😊Who needs social skills when you have TSLA 1000c 1/15Luckily I got that home gym homie, hitting maxes left and rightFor me it's the...."I know I'm right play but I'm willing to pay a premium to long date it to make sure of it"I'm bought Jan 2022 putsIt’s all subject to supply and demand in the open market.

For Blanton’s price point I think I’d rather have Four Roses single barrel. Especially considering when I find it lately it’s been marked up so much cuz the name recognitionType VIX into your watch list.  It’s the CBOE Market Volatility Index.  Maybe it’s blocked for some traders?  I don’t know why it would be...  Volumes are low so spreads can get out of hand, but it’s been easy money for me the last couple months.Don’t mess with putting money in VIX if your are new to the game. Just use it as a volatility indicator for the market as a whole when considering other trades.  VIX trades have a lot of moving parts, expire at market open (rather than close), etc.RIP in peace

Username does not check out.i hope you’re right so i can afford itNo, just my current holdings...

Will adjust at Monday open.Bro if you can’t figure it out based on the information I have provided, I can’t help you.Jesus you didn’t even read that post: you get 2 warrants for 9 shares, and one extra warrants per 9 units which aren’t available anymore.You will get 2 warrants per 9 shares if you hold through the merger. There is a risk to holding through merger, as most SPACs drop then, hence the incentive. Shares are good because they have a floor of $20. Warrants have no floor and so carry more risk, but they can also offer a higher reward in the event that the price rockets.

You gotta have your facts straight, don’t just shoot from the hip based on retards’ DDs.Yeah I got fiber as well. Wouldn’t know anything about wiring shit like that. So it’s definitely possible? Might see if I have a buddy that could do it, so I could hardwire to my master. Would it be worth doing that, or should I just go full mesh network?The Nest WiFi access points don’t have Ethernet ports now. Just the main one have one Ethernet port.  I use a switch to hook up the ps5 and Apple TV.What makes you think that? I’m not being a dick. I’m honestly interestedMy last diamond hand was FB 300c ex1/15 that I got in September, was up 50% twice before all the bullshit. Lost a cool 15k so I’m pretty shaken from diamond hands. Still very bullish on FB though. I think the coming Er will be a big bumpYeah I genuinely don’t care anymore if I get covid . I actually hope I get it every day so I can finally start living a life and not be a massive coward having to put my life on pause for months on end. Trump got it and recovered like come onYeah I’ve had friends have it they are fine . People are making out to be some bullshit that turns you into a zombie like what the fkDoesn’t mean everyone else will have a similar reaction. It’s foolish to think soI did 25.5, which would've been fine eod friday but I panicked in the morning when it was over 26. PLTR does seem to be beginning an uptrend now thoughLessssgo. Are you just going to hold if it breaks lower?Yeah. I figured with a weekly or monthly you’re very exposed to IV with earnings since they’re often inflated going into earnings. I was thinking with a 3 month out option I’d be able to weather the storm if there was any type of crush or downfall in price but, honestly I didn’t want to leave gains on the table due to my ignorance or potentially go in the red when I could sell for a profit.holy fuck.I can't even text my boss to gloat. He'd probably fire meI’d buy some contracts to find out$75 to transfer an account and I think $0.75 a contract for optionsyou realize the first time EVER for THCB to reach $10.70 was on Nov 23, right after I posted the DD?lmao you literally made a post on "thcb and qs to the moon" on Dec 23 at the fucking top, please tell me what is mooning next so I can short itIt might, but a quote was created to answer thisAt least I’m not a bearLook im not trying to fear monger but all bubbles went vertical before they collapsed, I cant predict the future and I might be overreacting, but there is a scary coralationHere look at this top is tesla bottom is qcom https://imgur.com/gallery/lLghePuWhat time is the bestI don't think it's stripe either, but I think that if it was, they would still have to deny it.TA bot?yesI sold $15 G H I V myself and bought back to close when they hit near 0.15. I was pretty happy with my first CC experienceI put 10k into ICLN, made $2k (20%)from it going up last week and $160 (1.6%) return in 2 weeks. If I hypothetically sold these calls every month I would get close to 45% return just from selling the calls. 

Edit: but yeah you’re right most of the time.That's my thoughts as well. 20% in a week and due for some correction.Return to this comment in 6 monthsI’m sure you’re right. I bet there wouldn’t have been a massive uproar calling out the nfl. No one would’ve intervened and everyone would’ve acted mature.Ok I think I got it. So there’s different rules based on the perception or how large an organization is?I think his self driving will be his main competitive advantage in the future. I hope EV competitors catch up to the hardware and prices begin to drop tho:(((Umm check again we got time in this hoeNot my point. It's about legal liability and the difference between being classified as a platform or a publisher.

I should have known this sub wouldn't understand.

My bad.I get it, but they want to be free from liability (platform), but control speech (publisher). Platforms can't be sued (liability), but publishers can be sued by the content they allow.

They want the cake, and eat it too.Don’t Fox News and CNN already decide what is ok for you to hear? Same thing.Get fucked loser, this isn’t a political forum. Big tech makes me money they can do whatever they want.People were calling for insurrection and killing of politicians, big tech is not democrat or republican they just want good PR and more money.haha before i got into options that was the biggest one day loss in my accountit didn’t even know they had an upcoming drug announcementYep same I thought they were gonna expire worthlessThat’s the one she uses for herself 🤢As I like to tell folks, my business most likely is not your business.  But let's have lunch.You'll prob be fine unless IV crush. I don't really expect nio to stay down with such a strong presentation. I bought the puts on friday I'm just getting in and getting out, then using the profit from puts back into shares lmaoTheta gang is going to be killing youYeah - I don’t confirm your biases. I don’t fit in here. 

66% correction coming soon. Strap upThat answers my question. This week was the local maximum for TSLA.That's true only 10pm after all. Better idea when european market opens.Anytime you see VIX brewing while ES/SPX is modestly down means the market is pricing in more uncertainty for whatever that may be building up.

After all, means the avg pricing of puts are building up vs calls. 

Sometimes it's pretty obvious when market is pricing in a correction like back in early Sep when everything is going to the moon but then VIX was going green as well.

Anyways this is low volume and early. I was just surprised it was at 3% that's all.It’s true I bought TAN at one point lolIm just seeing too many finally people selling their shit. Which is why I said I see it flattening for a week or two before selling offWho's worrying? It obviously works just wondering if it works on an individual level although I guess it would become harder and harder to borrow money.You didn’t. You wouldn’t!No I welcome the competition and wish the best man (or in your case the best woman) luck! 😝What’s ur alt?Do you even know what the definition of thot is retard?I’d think the dude is an attention whoreEnlighten a retard, how it’s up 2% if the price is 229, but us price is 236??Adam Grimes has a book on TA that is good

Adam Mancini on Twitter is a good guy to follow, he uses nothing but TA and he does it the right way.

Those colored lines you see in the pictures in my profile are drawn connecting 2 highs or 2 lows.

For instance, there is one with a dark red line that runs through the February high and September high. 

The further back a trend line goes, the stronger it generally is. Intraday trend lines are pretty useless, but trend lines that go back months work.I saw. Very impressive. Good work.

As far as I know Elon is still sleeping at his factory and going back and forth to germany/china/U.S to check on the gigafactory production.

Otherwise wait till she gets out the shower or some shitI didn't like it as a child but now I like it.Yeah, like a teen, I guessDef shouldn’t be worth more than teslayakuzaLmfaooYour an idiot that obviously doesn’t even use Twitter if you don’t think that account provides the fastest most reliable news. Go watch CNN autist.‘It’s a BUY at this price’ Jim Cramer, January 8th 2020. Then it immediately jumped 2% AH

I don’t know why you’re convinced I am making this up lmaoMy avg cost is just shy of the current price, so I'm not very bearish, only by couple of hundred dollars. I got in to diversify my portfolio more but after all of the political dramas, it's just sitting there and not printing. I'm tired of holding it while passing on other bullish opportunities. Thinking of closing the positions to buy some more ICLN leaps calls.Nah ive been making bank  buying the dips and selling the rips since 9$.Oh my badMy guy i have $45k and only $30k is exposed to the market. Ive gone from $5k-$31k so far investing.

my gf has like $3k in savings total atm. she is just interested in investing and trying to figure things out. 

This isnt an attempt to yolo away her last dime boomer.Okay ill look into it people roasting me like dude i am trying tk not fuck up my gfs small portfolio i am trying to encourage her a little bit with some gains as positive reinforcementWe'll seeOk, further back than 1783? You mean 1763 the one that ended the French and Indian War?My apologies I thought this was a Wendy’sI’m not stressing one bit my guy. They will print big.Probably UXVY $12 2022 or VIXY $20 2022 calls, both of which will increase if VIX goes up.Like I said, I’m getting rich or going broke.Totally agree... Just an interesting change in behavior from the full-on, balls out monetary policyAnything math related will pretty much guarantee you a job since no one wants to do mathBro football is fucking retarded. case closedGood point. The Paris news should come within the first month I would think?Just like to get the facts out there. But let me compliment you on your quick draw.Puts on me.

What a dickhead.Your local drug dealer.   🤷‍♂️Basically your posts on Twitter arent press releases. They are ads. They want certain ads. If they censored your private communication that you paid for thatd be a different story.It is perfectly applicable. Scale means nothing. If i see someone screaming i should have the right to kick them out. If i dont then im gonna go to some shitty businesses tomorrow and start screaming lol.❄️ All you want, unregulated speech on the internet is not possible other than going through tor. This is the undeniable truth, regardless of where you stand on censorshipOr just be lazy and go to [cathiesark.com](https://cathiesark.com)Ah haha ya that would be a problem watching stocks while flying. No problem. Congrats. You are correct that you’ve already won big. 🙌Lol it’s perfectly fine to never be satisfied. That’s a gift we share. And there is no consumption without production in this instance. So that’s an easy argument to make. 

Just take my advice about the goals: “If I hit X by Y, I’ll buy myself (or do or whatever) Z”.Nope... only reason I’m half way comfortable is the

What do I knowBanks still are turning away from funding oil companies to push the renewable energy and climate change initiative/narrative. Means anyone finding new oil needs to float the entire project. 

You also currently have a bunch of educated professionals looking for work in other industries because oil took such a huge hit during the pandemic for employment as well as big tech no longer assisting/lending their programs and software for increased exploration.


All forces are making it expensive to find new oil while all entities are cutting back supply to increase costsPuts on CanadaGlad I heldnah to get chinese money you need to be forced to align the political correctness in China, like the hololive incidentWow that really is huge. Last I heard Apple was backing off the news as if they were unhappy Hyundai had started talking about itNice, much realer than I realized it was.Always.

Asking seriously because I’d like to learn more  about sports but I’m a fucking dweebDefinitely. My guess is that travel sector stocks that are the same as they were in March last year are likely to rebound when everything blows over and people need to cure their stir crazy.

The only thing that sucks is that there's no growth right now, so there are technically better investments. We're probably early to the game, and we're missing out on gains elsewhere.https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/kui4oy/hyundai_and_apple_will_reportedly_sign_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfYou can also win by selling options or buying/shorting the shares toodo you blame Sikorsky for kobe’s death tooNIO day was boring.

Also I wonder if this changes how rh handles options that expire and if they’ll still sell them at 3pmCool. Lazy, and after I give you the stuff to look up, entitled. Thanks.damn 35 days what you do ??You were banned on the 15th of December for 2 days, for instanceYeah. Love sports betting. Been doing it for about 10 years. I went 0-2 in NFL today but I’m on the browns and they’re up 28-0 so I’m about to make my losses back for the day. Lol. Break even on the day.Yeah I replaced it with pen bc I forgot the name of the action and didn’t want others to get confused. I’ve only counted online and done OK. Looked for places I the north east USA that have better shoes (Atlantic city and the likes) and couldn’t find anything I was comfortable with.Congrats on the local game, I agree as travel gets easier to do, restriction gets tougher. Especially with the fact that they have counters watching the boards on their staff. Oh well, love the idea I was just a bit late to the gameI ust seen that. They’re expensive bro.

What about you?Old Forester Rye is amazing as well.I have been chronically disappointed by Four Roses.  Not sure if it's just a pallet thing or I am I unimpressed.I bought NIO 1/15 66c

Just one contract, and not because I think it's a brilliant play.  More just to break my cherry.  I want to do small, safe trades until I feel like I have some idea what I'm doing.  I have a couple 100k in play at vanguard and I want to do some puts as insurance also, I'm willing to spend some money in order to sleep well.Kinda surprised nobody has brought that back as an F2P game.And that's your argument? So more people will use robotaxis instead of personal cars? And that's supposed to help Tesla... how? 

You're a clown my friendYou said that already, but you didn't say how you know. If I own shares wouldn't they have sent me a notification informing me?Gotcha lolLolLol kI read enough PSTH 🚀That’s basically what I said though? You get 2 additional shares/warrants for every 9 shares you hold through merger at a lower cost per share. 

Wasn’t trying to tell you which way to go, just referring to the filing which you now are aware of. I’ll probably hold my shares regardless until it’s a target that I’m not high onYeah man it's really easy.  Mesh is easier but for my gaming stuff I keep all of it hardwired, but like i said, the kids don't complain about anything and I have their consoles on the wireless.I’ll start with - I’m probably wrong. But, I think with new stimulus talks, fall through and reconditioning of the Republican Party, shift to green energy - I think we are still in a solid run up, but I know that regardless of my political opinions on trump, he has proven to be a sore loser and probably has many advocates to help him hurt the US in spite (he is best friends with Un, after all)



Really it comes down to this - no one knows, I just think we have a bit more of a rally before a correction like last year, and then another turn forward, in the same fashion of last year, that will dampen the idea that Trump handled the economy poorly. If his last year and Biden’s first year are the same, Trump isn’t the “worst president ever” anymore, but instead “caught in the turning of tides”I’ll tell ya man...locking in small profits feels shitty when you see a position fly after you locked in, but hat feels even worse is knowing you could have locked in Something and then get absolutely destroyed. There are always new opportunities to make money by the market, but there are even more opportunities to lose money by you. Trust your gut, lock in your gains and keep rolling. You got thisWell its seem to affect everyone very differently. One of my friends is in his early 30s and used to run marathon, but he was stuck on a respirator for 3 weeks back in June. He is okayish now, but just started back at his job (he is a doctor working with covid patients). His girlfriend got it as well at the same time and she didn't even feel a thing.I mean I’m not gonna trust media on something like this. People like to see things go to shit, so they just hype it up. Everyone I know, including older grandparents, ended up being fine. I’m sure some people get it bad, but let’s be real, those same people would be rekt by the regular flu.Yeah I've had a few close ones too but have decided to wait until about 2pm to see if theta works against, if I actually want to close anything that's now made me money. 

I have 1600 shares right now so I'm playing with a fair bit. Closed all of them by about 2pm last Friday and opened for this Friday starting at 27, 27.5, 28.Average down lolLmfao right. What even is this game rn?I feel like I’m watching a college game, not playoff nflIf Cleveland manages to lose at this point it would probably be the most browns thing that could ever possibly happen and the universe would implodeTry harder, maybe you'll make some money too10:30am- 11am

But I have been holding my calls since NovemberTechnical analysis bot, but I'm not putting money on it because over the last 7 days it did go down at least 23%. Its likely we could see that this week as well. I can keep you updated on it when market opens.You can buy them back 🤨Just sell em every week fuck it lol20% gain is what I am waiting for. It hits that, and I am out. Bought at $350. If there is dip, I will hold and wait. 

Apple really could’ve had this market. Roku launched their product around the same time as AppleTV. 2008 ish. 

This is why I am not bullish on the iCar. Being a $2T co doesn’t guarantee success.Oh I'm not saying cancel culture would have been chill, just that it would have been fair and fine by me.It is not really a matter of rules. It's a matter of how those in power wield that power. Trump behaved poorly using Twitter and Twitter had a way to use its power to limit his impact. Kaepernick was using his platform as an NFL player to bring attention to something totally outside the NFL. Ironically, now that speaking out against injustice is a bit more en vogue, the NFL is doing a lot to try to do what Kaepernick was doing all along.For sure. On Carvana you can find 2021 Tesla for like 35k doe which I would 💯 buy if I came up big enough to do so😬😬😬You right, take it to r/politics they'll understand you there.There’s no legal definition of a platform. All Section 230 says is:

“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider." 

You can still sue people for libel/defamation for sharing information through social media, but the site isn’t responsible.Now imagine if only CNN existed.People call for crazy shit on r/politics too. You can find insane shit on any public forum with 500k+ people.

But big tech looks the other way because they clearly chose a side.Yeah I think they unexpectedly cancelled a trial so it wasn’t scheduled.

Still a huge overreaction in the share price though, they have a backup drug for that already in phase II i think.

You still in or did you say fuck it?🥭: “SAD”Lmao okay, I don’t even have positions in Tesla I’m cash rn. But yes you still must be new to the stock market and have not observed Tesla as well as the rest of the entire market since last March. Logic no longer exists pal.Looks like we got the next Autist Burry here

If it was so easy to time bubble, everyone would be doing itIt’s a secret 🤫Yeah but can you identify a joke when you see one?Making social media posts on any website is being an "attention whore" though. Technically, we are both doing that right now.I honestly don't know the exact correlation. I suspect we are leading them, and they are catching up to us?Fuck. I feel like I was touched by greatnessDamn bro, you might be right... she keeps sucking my dick, i have to do itPussyDude your digging here, do you want another shovel? 😂

I have a twitter account BTW thank you 😘

CNN? I'm a Europoor I don't watch your news channels, I tuned in a small bit during the elections that's about it.Nah you’re good, I’m not convinced until it’s +7%

I hope it doesNo you've gone too far back now! They're alluding to the Paris agreement of 1918 where Mr. Wilhelm and his howitzers were dutifully told to fuck off by Marshall Petain and his little Renault pea shootersEven gay bears like football. I’m not sure what that makes you.I think soIll try that, thank youI’m celibate, sorry boo.Do me nextDon’t kid yourself. Dems are gonna take full advantage of owning the prez, senate and house that they may only have for 4 years. 

It’s gonna be a flurry of bills. And they won’t have to send them back and forth for years cuz they’ll all be on the same page.Any chance on OPEC undercutting US and keeping prices low? I’m not sure how tariffs could come into playGme will never see $30 againso the actions he took to avoid offending the political bottomline is essentially politicalSame, I don't believe they have a beta car out in a year time, would be shockedYeah but the bubble has barely started getting inflated yet no where close to popping. You tesla bears have been wrong for years. How long until you see the light.It’s literally my name.Even if you didn’t think the dems would sweep that was the bullish hedge 

That shit is gonna be the gift that keeps on givingOf course buddy happy to helpI think it’s bad luck. Not sure if others do, but when I was big into sports gambling I swore off betting on my team after some unfortunate losses because my team didn’t cover.Ugh I know the feeling - it can be frustrating, but at least CCL is way above the S&P since April. We should get growth with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine data and more Oxford data by the end of the month.


There is also CDC data with what % of the population has been vaccinated, so hopefully cases/deaths drop as the at-risk get vaccinated...then cruise stocks should rise...


GOOD LUCK!!!My point...making money is possible at ALL times... bubble or no bubbleYou are going to extreme lengths to defend a corporation, and for that I condemn you yo retard jailI already have 20k in calls bought on Friday dip 🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🧟🧟🧟🧟Just popped up when I opened it.They will still try to sell at 3pm and it will count as a day trade. I have some money but I’m not gainsporn rich in there yet. I assume it’s just random.Sombody piss in your cheerios or what? Your kind of rude bud. Fucking 🌈🐻Criticized daddy Trump a bit too much for a certain moderator's liking.Word i know people have been going hard over the past 2-3 years, but never sparked my interest. Thats about to changeIt seems to have the right ingredients for a jump. I might go in with 1k-2k.Have you had small batch or single barrel? 

I agree the regular is underwhelming. 

If you like more oaky have you had Stagg Jr?Or Old Forester 1920You never know, it could work out given all the NIO news lately...  good luck!  My first option trade was a $300 SPY put contract that I sold for ~$1200 thanks to being a news junkie and guessing a market dump.  After that I lost a few thousand over a year of teaching myself what not to do.The US will always be divided into two groups: the haves and the have nots. The haves will buy Teslas, the have nots will realize that it simply doesn't make economic sense to own a shitty car when you can get a ride on a rich dude's Tesla for a small fee.It’s been the talk of the town in this subStill not getting rid of NIO thoYou just don’t seem 100% on the details is all. Eg “shares/warrants at a lower cost”Ight I got something to consider now. I’ll do some research, but if I can hook the Xbox directly to a mesh router i’d think it should be enough for me.Thanks man. Gl to you with everything I really mean itGood luck this week. I didn't roll them out yet because I think PLTR will regain what it lost on Friday.there's a ben's a rapist joke in there somewhereHow retarded would it be to log back into bovada and bet on the steelers pulling it fucking off?The fact that you bought common shares means you don't know how to make money off SPACs. And thanks I'm up 5M in 2020.Thoughts on 45c 1/1/22 ? Or 35c 4/16Your TA bot is saying $QS going up this week?Yeah you should almost always buy them back if you’re up over 90%. At that point the best you can do is make an extra 10% and if some news pops up you can lose unlimited profit.I would but the ducking Chicago exchange hasn’t written that many expiration dates.Roku's low cost for entry and partnerships with television manufacturers has made it an absolute force.

Bull signs include Draft Kings tripling their ad spend on the platform.

[Even The ROKU channel is getting traction with 14% growth between quarters \(more than the 11% install base for ROKU\)](https://twitter.com/GrousARK/status/1347559092575985664).

But like I said, I'm excited for Roku's future and earnings (I think February), I'm just waiting for a dip this week or next because of their run-up.We have a chance but we needed a score thereSounds great. How is that anyone’s problem except the GOP?It’s optics though, 5 people dead and a cop as well. Big tech def responsible for lots of stoking of the fire but needed a concrete person or tho my to blame and they fit the bill pretty wellsaid fuck it and sold for a loss. i was over diversified at the time anyway. now i’m split between ark and icln and keep some cash on hand to play weekliesYeah I’m aware. I’m not new to the stock market. I just know what a bubble top looks like. 

I’ll leave it at that. Check back in a few monthsHe cannot. He is not autistic and does not belong here if he's taking posts here seriouslyMake better jokes retard😝OkayAh shit!My powers are weak nowDoubt it. I'm sure Opec wants prices higher with lower supply then lower with low supply. Everyones hurting now while China gets further ahead.

Russia and Opec need money

And frankly lets say they did. It would bankrupt US companies and eventually oil futures would sling shot higher even faster. 

Look at UCO and USO. Theres no world in the future that can exist as bad as last March and negative cost. 

Prices are going to swing up no matter what.Well I don't see you making that point at all. I was just replying to your one comment stating "You can't act like every stock is a bubble bud". Basically the entire market is overvalued at these levelslmao YOU DO yikes bro sikorsky has nothing to do with itPositions?

PENN $100c 4/16
OKTA $270c 2/19
APHA $8.5c 2/5
CLOV $20c 12/17

NIO $55p 1/22Nice, it just happened to me to. I just went to look at NIO options prices and it popped up. Good luck with these new trades!Nope. Just tired of providing info to other people for good money stocks, and they either don’t read what’s happening in other comments in this topic, or they just don’t research. Besides, the iCar news has been pretty big the past couple days.Nice. Yeah it’s fun I like watching games. This time of year is fun because of NFL playoffs. I also really like March madness for college hoopsI have had single barrel.  Didn't mind it.  I have not had Stagg Jr.  On my list.Huge Old Forrester Rye fan.  Huge.  Turned into a bar staple at my house.Except Tesla is currently worth more than the market pandering to both the haves and the have-nots.

It's always startling how Tesla fanboys don't understand how ridiculously overpriced Tesla isThat’s why I used terms like “I’ve heard” and non specifics. Wasn’t trying to be misleading just suggesting you look at the filing DD. 

Either way we on the same teamAnd you as well. We all in it together everyone wants to eat ya know. Much love happy new year100 percent truly retardedOr should I say. Do it pussy, you won’t. This is the way. Lmao 😂I’m fuckin with the $45’s... it accounts for some fuckery in the mean timeWell one of them but not the actual one which specifically says call.Interesting. So you can sell FDs on anything (uncovered) and once you profit you can buy it back to closeARKG has a pretty good stake in VRTXQuit making assumptions. When you assume you make an ass out of U and ME. I’m not claiming it’ll go up nor down, just stating my observations. If you were at all doing the same since March you’d realize fundamentals as well as any sort of logic is no longer relevant. Bubbles included.Learn how to get a real buzz (like meth or crack). I bet you vape don't you?Ima fan of the mango man

Give me racist redneck or some bullshit flair

Plz do me daddyOk then, all inThe point of my thread was about traders’ lack of conviction. No matter the circumstances of the market as a whole, conviction with trades is representative of your own confidence that stems from your research. You simply cannot use the excuse that the metaphorical “bubble” is going to pop in order to justify your lack of confidence and conviction. Traders now have 0 backbone and point to lofty valuations to give themselves reason to be scared and even lazy.I’m excited and ready to lose it all!Stagg jr is great. 

I got lucky and got a George T Stagg this year. One of the best pours I’ve ever had

Haven’t had the OF Rye but I do love a good ryeYour missing the forest for the trees, TSLA has solved the automotive and rideshare industries, and with solar and batteries they are getting into the grid which is opening up a new market.[done ](https://imgur.com/a/9wIRSaX) worth the $1

☺️Yeah, if you want. But, Definitely more risk.vrtx is absolutely dominant in their cystic fibrosis treatmentsI bet you have putsNo thanksLook at this https://youtu.be/CQr2wiFMMDMI understand this point and think it's valid to a degree but the current market situation is very unpredictable. We're at ATH, currencies are volatile, oil is volatile, pending tariffs and trade agreements, it's really hard to be super confident that any one stock or etf is going to head in a specific direction atm. These are the times where hedge funds and professional traders that know how to hedge their positions effectively make their worthI have started the move over as so much new "premium" bourbon is trending towards scotchSo it's going into... another saturated, low-margin bubble market? That again doesn't explain why the valuation is so ridiculously high.God I can’t imagine getting assigned on some shit for like 50k. How you even get out of that lmaoI learned that when I was in PTI and lost like 70% overnight when their cystic fibrosis drug failed to beat Orkambi.Lmao coming from a guy who gets a buzz from nicotine.  If thats not the gayest bear post ive ever seen. Go smoke another cigarette and sit on your moms couch and enjoy the buzz, pussy
