i like to sell these type of options towards 2 pm. Look at how TSLA reacted to Fridays when it was heavily shorted this year. Look at how the stock moved across the day, it should be roughly equivalent. 

TSLA is the best analog for how these situations have played out within a WSB crowd.
icln a little bitch right now
I got 2 $15c for mid feb
is it a big dick play or a medium dick play or a small dick play? thats the question.
Depends if Frau Merkel and the EU/UK decide to skullfuck them. From everything I have heard they will.

Cunts made the biggest bubble ever now I can afford a home unless I get my own fucking bubble.
Self confirmation bias, I approve 🚀🚀🚀🚀
That's logically correct, but here at WSB we don't exercise the options  


We either sell them to some who's dumber than us, or we let it expire worthless, thus completing the full life cycle of WSB
Don’t stop. Don’t you fucking stop you dirty little slut.
At least the student is part of the rush.

Look at Chewy‘s market cap. Then look at GME. Makes no sense. Still A LOT of room upwards.

You're still retarded. But I'm happy it worked out for you!

GME fly high!!!
I am a girl and this seems legit to me
Surging! SURGING!
Plus the new 5000 series for mobile CPUs is, according to their claims, way more powerful and uses way less wattage, so I suspect that buying now and holding will yield value, but I'm retarded.
is GME gonna run another 20% open tmrw?? thinking of jumping back in
Okay melvie. Dont hurt me.
Our boys at the unknown financial institution
probably wouldn’t buy the bear leg until open tomorrow, with how this stock has been trending lately it’ll probably gap up overnight
Totally agree. Was caught bagholding for way too long, but hopefully I can put my money elsewhere for the time being and then get on again before the next moon mission

Yo wtf is going on holy shit
I'm thinking about getting into call debit spreads but am concerned that I don't fully understand the risk. I want to spend at least another couple weeks really trying to understand it so any advice is greatly appreciated. I just searched youtube and reddit for two hours and I still haven't found much to answer my questiosn. 

\- Say I I'm looking into a vertical debit spread. Is this financially irresponsible since I don't have the money to actually cover 100 stocks in the event that I'm assigned (I would want to start with practice money maybe $2k)? 

\- If I am assigned, will RobinHood put into massive debt or will it simply close the bottom strike buy call and make me cover the difference?

\- Are the risks of being assigned diminished if I simply close a ITM spread a week out from expiration?

Thanks for the help! Honestly sounds too good to be true in a bullish market.
hope u listened
Someone on this sub casually made another Million+ today

MM are terrified of GME at $40, keep buying! 7 minutes left!
Lol. You say not sure then list the reason why?
A straddle perhaps but with the large positions i dont think thats possible
Come on you bitch market
GME
Kamala Harris (VP) sponsored the MORE Act which essentially legalized marijuana federally. It has already been voted on and passed Congress, the Senate is waiting until the new President is elected before voting on it. As you mentioned, the Democrats won the Presidency, the House, and the Senate. Kamala Harris is the tie breaker for Senate votes. 

All that said, the legalization of marijuana is closer that it has ever been before and with the VP being the tie breaker of the bill she introduced, it is even more likely to pass (if needed). 

TL;DR: Yes, TLRY is gonna rocket. I've had 40 shares since it was 9.66 like a month ago.
Can i use affirm to buy affirm calls?

Correct - TCJA changed the relocation bit unless you're military or a few random exceptions like that. My employer 'grossed up' my relocation in 2018, but I'm guessing most don't.
Absolute fucking mad man
Just ask your wife's boyfriend to explain it, that's what I do.
Someone needs to slap their big dong on the table so GME can close at 40
Guys Biden is probably going to crank up capital gains tax, which means all those snobby r/investing types can't berate us for realizing short term gains anymore. Bullish AF
Out of the whole planet, this madness is only valid in Murica

Just noticed the flair on this post, is that OP set or mod/bot added?
Am I too late on BB?
Depends on the time of the day. If it hits $50 with a few hours left then you'll likely see green. If not, the price would have to go over 'break even' price ($51.98) for you to profit.
GME. Gonna pump after hours

I typed out a thing about how you should just fucking keep that 500 but we all know why we’re here. Godspeed, hope you don’t become homeless.
It's a bloody shame, really.  They were brave lads.
Do you think that a sound operational knowledge of what you're doing is helpful when managing or overseeing an operation, or do you believe in the idea that any "competent manager" can be dropped in to a situation to apply sound management techniques regardless of the underling subject matter?

Because ultimately you are going to find the most operationally qualified individuals in industry, not in academia (unless they came from industry).  And very often the most qualified individuals go to the most profitable companies, who can pay the best wages.  And those tend to be the companies people despise, due mainly to their wild profitability.
FUCKING BUY GME
good write up.. im in !
How the fuck did you get it for 0.53? I bought at open for $1.85 like a complete idiot. I am still sitting here kicking myself. Congrats though.
Second this. Even consoles are just becoming pre-built PCs and given another full generation that's exactly what they'll be. Whatever GME "wants" to become, Newegg already is. But once again, you can get all your gaming needs from Newegg, AMZN, Target, Walmart, and Microcenter, why would I use GME instead? Nostalgia?
I mossied the whole ride, but i heard that it not to late. I dont have much but I bought a call expiring tomorrow and 30 shares.
Can I have one (1) NVDA please

Jump in nowsies
If they have about 50M in equity in $24 1/15 puts, then what could they possibly do to hedge against that position apart from selling those contracts?  Even if those contracts expire worthless, that 50M loss can't turn into a larger loss.  Sure, they could hedge by buying shares, but that seems like a leap of faith that could actually lose them more money if the price goes down, as opposed to trying to sell the last of their puts and calling it a shitty day.  
I'm not extremely well versed in this world, but I'm not aware of any positions they could open today or tomorrow that would 100% prevent loss on these 1/15 puts.
ICLN - 2/19 33c

Lets get this bread, Buyden!
The PE license should happen early this year (already passed the test!). The manager position for my SO is less certain; he may move to a different company first since the industry he works in (manufacturing for airplanes) is not doing so hot right now. He was supposed to get the promotion in March right before COVID, but it's been "on-hold" ever since. If he does change companies he's pretty sure he would be able to negotiate for a raise even if he doesn't get manager. The delay in career goals is something to consider though, moving forward.

It's not ripping on the daily anymore.
at about 90M volume now. wtf does this mean for DTC and short interest?

GME!!!!
Got in at $11 while ago, stocks unfortunately, but ready too moon nonetheless. To be honest, idk if weed is legalized within 2 years before the next house/senate elections, but I think it’ll be decriminalized and descheduled for sure. At least not legal federally, but if NY legalizes, states will follow. It’ll just be a matter of time.
Author 🌈🐻
GME didn’t fucking lose its position with 90 million volume and MMs fighting to keep it below 40. That’s some retard strength
Jesus christ this post fucking sucks

Cheers boys!!
This is the best DD I've ever seen
Push!!!
You could be right.

This guy just seemed more methodical about it though. It wasn't just "Dems win, weed up!" There was way more research and thought put into it and it turned out to be right.

I think it definitely helps that GME kinda has the market corners. Other places sell games and consoles but when you think of gaming store you think Gamestop in the US at least. So unlike a steel play or a weed play where there are a bunch of options, if you're banking on the gaming industry it's Gamestop.
MMs
Ive been doing the same today.

Will you buy before close?
Tech is fucking dead now
Yea I cashed out and swiched to Tesla
Get the fuck in guys, strong close!
absolutely, nothing more efficient for daytrading comes to mind.

The bid/ask spreads are razor thin, the reason it's popular is because you can define entry + exit points and get in and out of a trade quickly, while getting the best fills.
Nah I wasn’t planning to use that 2k anyways. All good spy/apple
I have 2022 and 2023 LEAPS. Hoping we see more up than down for TLRY this year. Fingers crossed.
Uhh where the gains at? Am I retarded or are you retarded?
There is a post around here with some math in it. This references that post.
I started in June and I'm 33.3% up and I lost money on stupid stocks too (I sold TSLA in Aug when it dropped from $1080 to $899 in a panic etc). The trick I've really learnt in this market is just to hold and it'll be fine in the end. Until the crash comes lmao.

Sold today for 120%. GME still have way to increase more but sometimes it’s time to put a stop. 120% gains is already good.
Yeah on PE ratios... I've heard low is bad and high is bad so I'm kinda.. not sure. But I'll give it a look. Thx

Theta changes throughout the day - Go watch the Theta on some GME Puts and see what I mean - I sold GME 15 Jan Puts earlier today with a theta of -96 at the time - currently sitting at -63 and the IV went from 323% to about 260% - an extreme case for certain, but it will show you how theta is always changing during trading hours -
We know we are... Thanks for the share! ✊🏽
>An increase of shares outstanding is inflation for current owners

Yes... but it isn't inflationary of market cap, of absolute revenue, or absolute income. It's not relevant to look at shares outstanding here. If AMD issues new shares, that doesn't raise or lower their actual revenue. 

Please quote exactly what of any of my comments you are arguing against, because it seems to me that you're making entirely irrelevant comments. Price/revenue/income per share isn't relevant in a discussion about the value of a company as a whole; it's only relevant to the value of a share, **which isn't being discussed in the comment chain that you're commenting on**.
lets get it bro
From what I've heard, it looks bad only if it's extremely short and repeated. So 2 years and 2 years and 3 years is okay. 4 years and 3 years and 6 months is okay. But then 1 year, 6 months, 5 months looks bad....but again, this advice probably will change depending on what job sector you are in!
thots like the pain though

Yeah I mean Tesla is the perfect example....valuation means nothing *currently* but that will obviously change at some point. But as I said in my other comment...the momentum is insane and it’s getting help from some market structure factors (short squeeze)... IF this breaks to new highs (which is still a big ifff)....I think this runs
why?
I am going to assume that a lot of people will want to close short positions before this 3 day weekend?
Isn't hurst exponent for exactly this, finding if data is trend following or mean reverting?

Tesla is most of my portfolio, poor.
I don't think anyone would bat an eye at three companies in 8 years unless it was something really skewed like 6-1-1 or 7-.5-.5.

Well if I had to guess, I’d say Tesla will be ~40% of new consumer vehicles sold, a similar percentage of long haul trucks will be the Tesla truck, and their solar roofs will take off. The valuation is based on the future

Do you boys believe the inifinity squeeze will happen tm? DO YOU HAVE FAITH IN THE YOLO OR SHOULD I ROLL THIS BITCH?
Not while its below 20
I agree for the most part but I also think a large part has to do with supply and demand for the candidate pool. In low unemployment, high economic growth periods you don’t typically get dozens of super qualified candidates to pick the very best one to make an offer to. 

Now it’s also geographically dependent, but most of my recent offers I’ve made have been ‘well they can probably do the job and should be okay’ not ‘hell yeah get this guy here ASAP let him loose on everything’. If I’m debating between multiple rockstars it’ll be something that I’ll consider bc I know I could get called out on it by my bosses or hr to at least discuss the reasoning and the risk of losing a lot of time and money invested into someone only being with the company a year or so.

ICLN wider basket
I am up 25% on TLRY... not sure what they do though..can anyone enlighten?
Pain. And now at these levels I’m going all in 😂😂
I think you underestimate how hungry certain types of people are for travel and leisure. I remember reading a breakdown of summertime bookings, and the release in question (I forget if it was about an airline or other travel related thing) mentioned that summer is booked to fuck for them.
twiddled my fingers at 1.04 LOL. 

1,000 shades at 1.15... let’s ride
now the next step is making them mention our president u/deepfuckingvalue
Next level DD
I'm not an options guy. At some point this is going down. It's another Blockbuster situation.
All he has to do is mention clean energy
...why would top be in before shorts cover?
oh ye of little faith.
Lack of APHRIA comments today were dad. That motherfucker is up 21% on the day
Same
Sleepy joe probably meant 1 billion dollars. He’s so delusional
why
Not if you do it right. Effectively what you're doing is contributing to a tIRA (not taking any tax breaks for it because you don't qualify for them), and then converting the money immediately to Roth (which you're allowed to do). You'd pay taxes on any gains, but you wouldn't *have* any gains.
Grudgingly Dumping SPY 1dte calls for 20% loss an hour ago sure feels a lot better now...
Well anyways thanks for bringing it up cuz you reminded me to sell a NIO put with my spare cash
I'd honestly feel comfy with the January 2022 $45c
How many of you guys woke up this morning thinking, “Fuck, I should have bought more at close...” Well, here we are again...
Shit, ICLN is discounted right now
Before a stimmy speech?

WTF HAPPENED WITH GOEV FUUUUUUUUU
amen to that
All hands on deck for $VALE
Why
I think it's good to diversify and I like and own shares in both of these companies. However, it seems you are insinuating that you have ALL of your capital tied up in GOEV, which I would advise against. Even if you went half and half, you will have ALL of your capital tied up into two VERY volatile SPACs (also not great). But high risk/ high reward. 

Ultimately I believe GOEV has more short term and long term potential. Go with your gut. Both are solid in my opinion. Good luck.
Hold my up 37% XOM $50c for 3/19 or sell for profits like the 28yr old boomer I am?

"What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Senseonics Holdings shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Senseonics Holdings is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Medical Info Systems industry that ranks in the Bottom  6% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter"

I'll pass lol
Yup CRSR TSLA NIO and PLTR all red today

Fuck
 The options will have value across the day, i can't imagine a lot of people deciding to exercise at 9:30am. It's a possibility, but it's unlikely this will play a big role until the very end. I recommend you look at TSLA graphs because its the same type of situation and the same type of crowd. Should give a good comparison for what type of movements we can expect to see.
https://www.nano-di.com/ame-markets-2020/aerospace
Anyway just one last advice do your own research about the matter. You should always confirm what other people tells you, dont just go with whatever someone said in reddit.

It will save you a lot of trouble
GM
Gme
Feels like the MMs really don't want GME over $40. This is annoying for my $40 calls that expire tomorrow.
$100 and if it drops back below $1, I might throw another $100 at it.  Still have all my bngo profits to lose!
Why
Well if you do stay in them. You’ll end up losing a lot of money if you can’t stomach a risk.
Literally about to just dump all my apple entirely. This is fucking infuriating

Bought 1/15 $50 calls at open for 1.98, diamond handed through the dip down to 49cents and sold at $3.30 mid day for a nice tendy dinner. Will probably do the same tomorrow. It’s that mid morning dip that you just can’t pay any attention to.

Do you have any idea how Glacier works?  I mean like physically?  Apparently it’s a big mystery based on my random googling around.  [This](https://www.itproportal.com/2013/11/09/one-of-techs-most-elusive-mysteries-the-secret-of-amazon-glacier/) guesses that it’s cabinets full of hard drives which—look I’m not here to judge anyone clearly these people know what they’re doing—sounds like a 12 year old from 1993 designed.

Lol MTLS dipping
Come on get that ass at 40!!!
we are in this together, fellow retard!
Won't be anything for BIOL until later in the Spring. I sold it and betting more on TYME.
that’s 1000% growth.. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Zero shares to short implies the demand for shares is wicked high. So those holding shorts at this point are either hoping for the stock to dip tomorrow or just let their positions expire. Given the bullish sentiment of GME, it's likely these people stuck in their shorts will elect to buy shares, driving the price higher.

Damn. The squeeze really has only begun.
I shop renter's (and auto) every year. Renter's is an annual policy, while auto is every 6 months. 

I'm just too lazy to shop every 6 months. I did that early in my 20s, but I don't care enough anymore. Plus my current provider (Progressive) has been the cheapest every year anyway.
Just hopped on the $BB train...toot toot
i bought calls, i assume that's why it's drilling

So Derek got my wife pregnant (again). This time Derek doesn’t want us to get an abortion. Really hoping my GME calls 10x my money at the very least. College tuition doesn’t pay itself. I bought at the very top but hopefully GME can do a 40% leap for the 3rd day in a row.

You cannot time this: get your shares NOW.
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO BUY GME YOU FUXKN IDIOTS!!
Same. It also just hit its price from 2017. I’m going to wait until tomorrow for a pullback. Here’s hoping.
Day traded ozon and viac.
This is what was supposed to happen when I got 0dte SPY puts at 380 yesterday

Thanks. And we do this so the broker can’t short our shares? How can they short the shares if you own them?
I just read about this and what kind of gatekeeping bullshit is this? You can day trade but only if you're rich? ($25,000)

Don’t wanna be that guy .... but fuck me people
Still fomo’ing into GME lol , I applaud the conviction and the run up but jeezo much juice u crazy fuckers trying to squeeze from this bad boy
Lmao yeah. It's fucking dope. I'm up 14k this week from just stocks
I went to a small town barber today because both my regular people were out and no shit this dude tells me halfway through he writes gospel music. I’m like rad and he asks if I want to hear them. I said sure because I thought he was joking. Nope. Plays about 5 of his originals and sang along the whole time. Never again.
I agree
#rampant speculation
so many people saying buyden's stimmy annoucement will moon the market, yet spy is skydiving like if there's no tomorrow... scared
I’m laughing looking at the SPY chart 😵
Lol are Dems going after FB?
Anything is possible with the right amount of rockets
Just bought 5 this morning
IV crush will rape u as it has raped me

30 cents, 4 minutes. Lets do this GME
The cause is as important as the gains! This is a war!
AFRM is okay, I got in on the pump on dump with a few shares, when it was $95 by the time it reached the general public it sort of ruined the upside
Fully agree. My first job was all of the responsibility, none of the power or ability to make any changes. Every job since then has been better and better.
I got in anyway at $1.16 - hopefully this keeps climbing tomorrow. Just missed out on a little quick 10% jump at the end of the day though...
You know banks have compliance departments,  right? Banks will hire literally hundreds-thousands of people to make sure said bank is following the law
Makes more sense for GME to be at 50b than PLTR currently. That would be about 12.5 times P/S which is about the valuation of SQ and PYPL. Not impossible
Yea, but every time he says somethings in the millions, it’s always in the thousands. Numbers aren’t really his thing!
APHA SHOOTING TOMORROW
GME the safe haven stock though
imagine if someone told you the only safe haven 1 year from now is Gamestop
What about twitter and snap?
Nah all the way I meant I’ll close my short calls we are bullish

Okay when do we buy puts on GME for a quick swing?
how many times do we have to teach you fucking gay bears
These are solid investments. From here you let the play run itself. As long as you won’t need the money you invested, and you maintain the discipline to let it sit, you’re golden.
Why did spy dump lol
We’re so fucked tomorrow
As long as they keep censoring free speech they will continue to eat a dick.
No, that’s great advice. But it did jump back to ~40k already. His advice probably caused people to panic sell at $34k. But he can’t really be blamed for that.

Anyway, the first point about diversification still stands.

Thanks for the shout out. Financials are due by end of month and they will be amazing. This is still good entry. Long term, short term (not day trade but a week or two) is good right now.
I don't get why you guys are trying to turn a clean energy ETF in to a meme stock... Leave ICLN alone damn it....
What strike?
Explain
Just bought in, gone down 5% already 😅
I just joined WSB yesterday and if all goes well tomorrow than joining this reddit is the best thing I've ever done!
Always gets me with the swipe left lol. Im not a tinder user
WSB needs to work together to actually get an owning percentage of a company. Rename it to just the rocket emoji.
Damn so is tesla not gonna rally today? I thought buydon was good
That might affect the market!
I'm new. I bought SNAP today because of the dip. It only seems like it went down because Trump was banned. I'd be pretty confident it'll rebound.
yes..
Gonna start going once i get my lambo tho
I cant wait to see how the media eventually spells his username.
Honestly man probably not. That stock has been such a bitch for no reason. Literally everything looks good but the price movement
tf dude big squeeze is tomorrow
ONE OF US. ONE OF US.

Well if US doesn't build nuclear, unfortunately natural gas will be the only alternative for reliable dispatchable fuel
Wtf BABA lol
bond prices move inversely to yield.  if yield is down, price is up.
Sold my calls. Now swinging heavy shares of VXX and UVXY.
What the actual fuck NVDA
Coke and hookers.
Definitely it's like plug wait a year from now
I have been making pretty good money on oil/energy and have a couple oil/energy etf's that have treated me very well. Even a lot of the electric generation that will be needed to power all those Tesla's will still require oil/gas. As it stands we still have power shortages going on, so it isn't like we need less of it. Unless Biden's administration has an aggressive plan for Nuclear plants, the renewables just aren't at the scale needed to make getting rid of oil practical. Even if he does choose to move on nuclear power, it will still take years to get those reactors online.
Keep buying GME shares, 5 minutes left!
U good bb

Yes they take there profits from selling off the calls and dumb them back in short, meaning thing thing could possibly hit 75 or 80 by the end of next month
YALL BETTA NOT FOLD ON THIS GME TRAIN LETSGOOOOO!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
My big tech companies really aren't doing well today. Are we predicting imminent regulations on them or is there a piece of news I missed?
The question you poses fundamentally assumes that the market can be timed. The simple answer is no. We could have a bull market for the next 50 years or we could have a huge crash next month. This year could be a huge bull market compared to the past, but a slow bull market compared to a hyper growth market over the next 15 years. Nobody knows and everybody has their own theories with evidence to back it up. 

At the end of the day, all you can do is dollar cost average and invest money as you're able and keep it in. 

There's no way to "do the math" because all mathematical models would have to use assumptions from the past. You may have heard the saying that past returns do not predict or promise future returns.
Didn’t this IPO yesterday? Went from 49 to 98 and stayed flat all yesterday and today is the day you fomo in?

Mini-yolo. Makes reading this sub that much more entertaining.
I always sell 1/4 (or less, jackpot is one share paying for the rest) of my position if it makes the rest of the position free.

Because now you're at $0 cost basis and can just AFK from those stocks.

Put in a $150 sell order and go sip some mai thais.

You’re right, Biden is less energizing than a bag of wet dog shit, but money talks for itself. That’s all the market will hear tonight 💰💰💰
more like GME 420.69. never selling. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
So how does option expiration affect stock price as far as puts goes? Why would option expiration positively affect share price for GME?
You monster.
I hope so 😱
When you remember that Burry bought in to GME at on April 2nd 2020 at $2.85 a share...
Are we selling now ? 


(Please don’t hurt me)
My broke ass only has 14 shares and 3 contracts at 12c 3/19 I don't want to fuck this up like pltr and gme
Give GME a pump CNBC!
Worth it
The most important thing is to secure gains.
If your not buying BABA calls wtf r u doing
It's tired
That’s why they’re pinning
hold and you'll be breaking lambos in half

i understand that did not make sense but you know what i meant.
This is why I posted.
WOOOFFFFFF 🚀🚀🚀🚀
all because jack dorsey had to "explain himself" instead of just being like "so what we can do what we want"
B = 2nd letter in the alphabet. 2 + 2 = 22. $22 EOW
I actually know someone who's been bagholding 1000 shares on BB since 08 lmao, his negative P/L is a reminder to not buy boomer stocks.

Just remember once the merge happens Apha is converted at 0.83 to tlry stocks. If you pay attention to the price differences you may get some free stocks/money.
I'm all in on GME,TLRY,ICLN,POWW,SWBI RICH OR ROPE TIME BOYS
Lol I doubt that. You probably smoked them all away. Poor
BB to $11 tomorrow
Normally yields dip an bond prices rise when everyone is selling stonks.  Bond market has been completely broken by the Fed so now it just does whatever the fuck it wants.

They’re talking GME on CNBC
I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER TO SEE A BEAUTIFUL FLAT LINE AS I HAVE TO SEE GME IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES
I mean it sold off yesterday and am surprised it still struggling but might be the share issue.
Take profit in TLRY or hold?
Buyden better not become BURDEN. Don’t you fucking let me Down

But there are still shares to short.
If it goes to $694.20 I will get a dollar sign tattooed on my penis.
Some BS
why is that?
What did you get in?
800 at 1.85, I’m ready to see the Great Wall
It's already printing bro. Bears will try to drive them price to cover their shorts. Fuck them
Ohhh that’s why it’s dropping, I believe Twitter did the same, ig I should be fine
>more shares is less asset per share for existing owners

See my other comment. This is all not relevant at all.

>Lisa Sue and friends are giving themselves a lot of shares and insta selling them for profit

*Not only* not relevant, but also not true at all. She doesn't control how many shares she gets - that's set by the board, and diluting the shares only **hurts** her as she is both a holder of stock and her income is dependent on the increased price of said stock - meaning she would want to **decrease** shares outstanding and thus increase the price per share, making her options that she's paid in much more valuable.

You have this entirely backwards. You could not be more wrong. Please invest in ETFs until you have the basics figured out for your own good.
Just goes to show that no Market without Mango.
Thanks babe
SPCE $35 calls 1/15
Well I have retarded gme $49 expiring tmrw lol
My TSLA calls fucked me right in the ass this week
Bought 5 shares of gme
You probably made that's dude's day
Need to buy something rn what what what already in gme and don’t tell me more
Lmao
Just maxed out my instant deposit on GME.
GME should do an offering at this price for sure. Can allow them to fix a lot of problems with cash faster and not be taking BK risk later.

I had a very good 2020, 100k is not a monster position for me. Just a significant bet.
🍻 welcome aboard
okay we'll go with the second one nice work
so they sell now to buy later?
I am here already thank god. The couple thou I’ve made off GME today is offsetting the -3k I have on apple spy and tesla
I suspect it'll go up now bc biden is announcing the $1400 stimulus tonight.
BB is a rocket ship with tits, first titties to land on Mars!

Markets gona be red tomorrow just to cuck us
Why is everything tanking?
If your portfolio is red you didn't invest in GME ITS NOT TOO LATE
There are so many unemployed people who just bet their life’s saving on GME to hit big over the next week. This is going to be an amazing blessing or a totally sad shitshow next week.
Here we go. Rocket is fuelled. Pre checks complete. I’m hyped.
Today was kind of boring actually. Maybe the events of yesterday have ruined me.
I had a feeling it was hyped by the shills...

Scheduled EOD fade for BABA
1.9 T is underwhelming
Almost every stock has worked out so far, especially over that time frame. Whether you picked something like Costco or if you went with Target, you've earned somewhere around 18% per year if we're simply looking back over your five year (2015 - present) time frame. If you decided to bet on more volatile items such as Netflix, Amazon, or Nvidia, you've been getting close to 50% per year for the past 5 years (or 70% in the case of Nvidia).

Keep in mind that the SPY has returned like 12.5% per year over that period as well, so a well-diversified investment plan has been successful too. 

The real risk for all of us is a prolonged drawdown period, where instead of volatile swings down and back up, we just slowly bleed down over a multi-year time frame, and then slowly climb back up over the next few years. Again, this hasn't happened since 2000, but I wouldn't rule it out as an impossibility (though I doubt that it will happen this year since we're in a zero percent interest rate environment for the near-term).
Lets get real here.  While u/DeepFuckingValue is on the moon, Ryan Cohen is on Mars.
can you smell that? I smell......fromunda cheese. UNWASHED UNCIRCUMCIZED SHREK DICK INCOMING ON GME
How do you sell shares above market price.... impossible?
Buy GME >>>SHARES<<<<
Just bought 420 Shares of Xilinx (XLNX) 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


For everyone who doesn't know, they will merge with AMD and anyone holding Xilinx will get 1.7234 shares of the merged company in the end, which means of the deal goes through you can make money 💰 on this exchange ratio as you can currently get Xilinx at ~1.55 of the price of AMD
WOOF there it is WOOF there it is
Buffett said that? All I’ve heard him say is put your money in VOO and forget it if you don’t know stocks.
you should buy shares

Another squeeze tomorrow — it’ll go past 40

Everything suck today!  Especially MasterCard and Apple.
I was just getting so confident again too
YOLO until it becomes too large to YOLO, meaning over 500k
Realistically how does this dip change your long term view of this company? It shouldn't. If you've invested in snap it means you believe in it.

I will upvote any negative comment about Tim 🍎. This mofo been giving me sideway action for a while.
You didn't need to award me, but thank you anyway!  There have been some knowledgeable people on here that have helped me out, so it was the least I could do.  May your tendies be numerous.
ROTATE TO MEME STOCK!!!!!!!!!!
Yes, NYSE closed.
Yep, given half of my account to Baillie Gifford to manage because i cannot be trusted.
Last second plays?
I see now, I thought he meant that JP Morgan literally took stock from him and not just mad an analysis that caused the stock to dip. 
Thank you for the clarification!!
Oh yeah for sure, ive been on reddit long enough to know that. Im just getting into stocks and know next to nothing so I plan to do a lot of research before going in much
Wait!
In for 50 more gme. I'm maxed on margin. Don't let me down you fucking autists

Only 8 shares of GME just bought!
Rotation from every single thing on the market into GME

HAHA of course man. It is a stretch but where there's a will there's a way.
Don't you know that B&M stores are dead? Everyone goes online now. The only hope is if some like Ryan Cohen comes in and shakes up their online presence so they can compete with chewy.

Thanks. Now I'm addicted.
ONE LAST BIG PUSH FOR THE DAY BOYS COME ON
I don't mean the buy ask spread. I mean the stock price of one stock jumps in increments of 1 cent and another stock always jumps in for example 20 cent increments.
Or does that just depend on my broker?

>NYT buy vs rent calc suggests buying is marginally better than renting an equivalent unit using conservative numbers (home appreciation at inflation, market at 8% returns). Buying is heavily favored if the housing market appreciates much above inflation.

This is the problem with these calculators; they give the illusion of emotion-free logical reasoning but the outcomes are completely dominated your wild guess at how much housing will appreciate.

It sounds like you want a house.  There is nothing special about home purchasing decisions compared to any other purchase.  Do you want it?  Do you know how much it will cost?  Are you comfortable with that trade-off?
Yay so I’m not a retard! This market is behaving somewhat rationally. Maybe? Who knows.
Three minutes to buy GME shares

GME

You will regret not buying

Huge pump incoming after hours
Thanks bro
20 @ 37
What does that have to do with GME paying their employees like dog shit? That doesn’t sound like a great company to their employees. You do realize they don’t have to pay them the almost absolute bare minimum legally allowed right?
>  The more special interest and slush money in it, the less likely it will be to pass.

The more likely you mean right? All you need to do is buy off a few republicans, aren't there military bases to maintain somewhere?
YOLO'D on a FB put FD.

Option have a value called delta. It determines how the option price changes with regard to the stock. For strikes near the current price(ATM: At The Money) , it's usually about 0.5 meaning for every dollar the stock goes up the option goes up $0.5.

The lower the strike, the higher the delta.

He made a stock option that the value will be worth $15 on Feb 5th.  Ballsy.

 `3/19 15c`  

Another for $15 on March 19th.  This is just a spread to hedge his liability.

 **Feb 12 '21 $12.50** personally.   🚀
Lol, had that one on https://wsbsynth.com/
Interesting. This could be a game changer in US.
🤘🏻🚀🚀🚀🚀
It may very well, and I may see better prices then. And yes, I'm red for entering the trade too early. In my experience, these things suddenly start happen when they are happening. I'm pretty confident, so I want to be in the trade. I may enhance my position tomorrow AM. Remember though that I'd exit this position if tomorrow didn't dump, and the options have a week on them, so my var is not the full value.
Maybe I’m dumb, I’m in the red on every single steel call I’ve put in. Biden needs to give a speech about infrastructure reform or something man.
Grats, close to $20k today?
Feels good seeing people still hopping into GME. Feels good to have been early at $13.31 a share. More to go!

Watch once the 40$ puts start capitulating.  🤣🤣🤣
No idea what I'm doing. Bought some gme at several instances last year or so. Was holding 65 shares at an average price of $4.85. Sold all today at $40. I hope I did the correct thing 😅
Literally last chance to buy GME. Everyone else, hold and prepare for tomorrow.
Bought some SPY 1/15 calls just now let's go Buyden
This initial push is based off of news that their preliminary sample mining produced encouraging results. Essentially they've proven that they have the goods to produce the quantity and quality of Manganese necessary. The endgame for this stock's potential is if they actually succeed in making a deal with Tesla or some other company for battery production. If you're banking on the latter, then this stock has a long way to go before it reaches its peak. I wouldn't count on it growing past .50 based on the recent news alone, though.
Still you, just lucky retarded
Hope you guys are right. Just pulled in some calls for tm. $55😂 let’s see what happens
GME GANG UNiTE 💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎

At best a flat day tomorrow, potentially sell the news on this stimulus plan.

GO GO GAJETTO 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
i bought a lot in the last 2 dips, already sold half of it. If tomorrow starts green ill buy calls with my last 3k, if it starts red ill buy stock.

In other words, i blatantly betrayed you because my broker doesn't clear my stock money and my options money at the same time, so i have to sell stock today so i can buy options tomorrow.

I love being Canadian.
GME GAMBATEEEE

Gooooooooooo
Less downside in BB than GME. Can't go tits up boys
they have really excellent robots that prevent them from getting screwed. They sometimes use other options to hedge too. And sometimes they do lose money. Just not on average.
Melon gave me tendies last week and took them all back this week. Had a few exit opportunities that I didn’t capitalize on
IT'S RIGHT THERE

Isn't that part of the stimmy plan he is talking about tonight?
Whos holding apha calls for tmrw
Say I have 5k and want to buy dkng at $50. Normally, I’d set a limit order and leave it gtc. Wait for a red day sometimes it takes weeks. If I sell covered puts, the contract sells around $100. If it takes several weeks to exorcise, I’d gain that premium every week that I sell a put until it hits the $50 strike. You risk it dumping way past the strike of course, but who cares if you made theta while waiting.... man I think I’m theta gang now
2 more fucking cents BUY AND HOLD
wow... FB is an absolute piece of shit

I use trade Republic. I think it's a bit like the German version of robinhood. 
Could that be the reason?

Same brother, i need this to rescue my portfolio. When are you going to sell? 5mins into open?
Remindme! 74 days ARKX
I once had the same question as you.  Had a stock go up over 10,000% and I didn't want to sell.  Not ANY of it.  Thought I had the winning ticket and it was going to be smooth sailing from there.  

Welp.  It lost ALL of it's astronomical gains and went right back down to where it was.  Even left me with a little bit of a paper loss for a while.  I still hold that exact purchase, and it bumps along at a certain level, never going up or down that much.

I came to the conclusion that even though I was *massively* beating the average annual return of the S&P 500, I wanted more.  1,000% wasn't good enough for me.  10,000% wasn't good enough for me.  I wanted more.  My gut told me that in 5-6 months, it would be worth even more.  Sound familiar?

That, my friend, is what greed does to you.  You've been given the gift of free and easy money.  Lock in at least a little bit of a gain.  Maybe just 10% of your stake.
So are we anticipating BB to moon now or???
We will be Winners with our genitals out!

OMG
90% of the people here behaving as if they are the smartest and most successful are mostly people who got lucky. Many just copy social media or throw everything into one single thing (tech), it's just that in a bubble there is always one very obvious profitable move which will continue to work until the bubble pops.

In the long term, these lessens you make at the age of 18 will turn out to be really cheap. The mistakes I made leasing me to lose 200€ at 18 help me now to be more cautious at the right moment because I have actually experienced losses which where hurtful (at that time).

Just.don't forget that as long as you have so little money and are so young, investing in your human capital will give you a much better ROI over time. If investing starts to lead you procrastinating in your studies, it is time to just throw everything into a World ETF or S&P500 and stop caring until you have a job and money to play around with.
Huge speculation right now however bb isn't just a cellphone company. They sold some phone patents yesterday because they ain't just a phone company. The stock could be worth 30 bucks by end of the year, depending how things go.

Close enough. No idea what we'll see tomorrow but I'm diamond handing GME no matter what
The moment of truth!
Well I can’t say if it’ll make you rich. All I can say is that I see it as a long term, conditional on cryptos keeping their run, which I think they will until at least the end of this year. 

There are also a few things happening atm that could be good for Argo. It just got up listed to OTCQB, making it easier to trade for Americans, and making it a little more likely that big money comes it too. They are also increasing the size of their mining fleet around beginning-mid February.

The company’s management also seems good and who knows maybe in a few months it’ll get uplisted onto the Nasdaq, which will make it much more likely to get big money buying in.
Zomedica, they actually might be legit if you into penny stocks. Not like a full YeetYolo like us Autists
I have a guy who does it for me every year.  They're called 'agents' I think.

&#x200B;

(I'm being snarky, but its pretty awesome.  I used to try and do it all myself but these days I don't have the time so I just occasionally get an email from Mark like "hey if we switch you to XYZ company you'll save $300" and I'm like "make it so".)
APHA shares will transform into .83 TLRY shares each. Currently APHA shares cost .63  what a TLRY share is worth. Therefore you are getting a whole extra .2  TLRY share for free when the merger completes.
Pls
great job everyone thanks

Personally, I want to make the US version of OHB at some point
Don't buy the GBTC. Just buy the coins themselves. You're paying a massive premium (like 17%) just to have somebody buy and store one asset for you. It's actually not that hard to buy and hold crypto so that premium will cause GBTC to crash as soon as there's a real crypto ETF.

As long as APHA is below 17% of TLRY, it is better to buy APHA (arbitrage opportunity since each APHA stock will be 0.83 TLRY stock)

in monkey language: if you think TLRY is going to  **🚀**  then buy APHA.

I checked out /U/DeepFuckingValue’s YouTube channel and he seems like the nicest dude. Just a real genuine guy who works hard and wants to teach others. The wholesomeness is quite the contrast to the absolute filth rolled out here on a daily basis. Super happy for him and his success, he is super deserving.

GME attacked with a giant mace on the bell.

Shrugged it off.
Realistically, what can Melvin do to hedge their shorts? Surely they are not just hoping the stock goes down fast enough for the interest not to burn them?
Another day, another 13% of my account gone. Thanks Tim Apple
Hey AMD........

FUCK YOU ! 🖕
With a tiny company like GME, this sub can absolutely make a difference. GameStop market cap was like 500m when it started becoming a meme. There’s over 1.8m people on this sub.

Any chance of a dip any time soon?

I'm 100% new to investing and have 12.92 shares.

Got 53 BB shares too, I wish we had Robinhood here in NZ

GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
gonna yell at charts.
It will only take a few institutional investors selling and taking profits. That will cause a chain reaction of algos and boomers stop-loss orders triggering like a domino effect

Before you start buying in the first day of the crash, remember that it took 15 years for the market to come back to the 2000 levels. It could take even longer this time
Snap big gay
They're trying today but it's a little late so buy after hours and by tomorrow we'll get it to 12.11
What rule 3? Hehe?
I am new here
Sold the share short. Price went up, hedged with calls. 

Calls expire worthless or end up ITM and exercise (shares are bought).

Still have to cover the original short (shares are bought).

Looks like more buying to me.

Appreciate the advice 🙂

bought SPY FD puts at open. sold for 20% loss. if i held, it would be 100% gains   😭
My strategy has become... get on WSB with 15 minutes left... flick my thumb up on the screen and whatever symbol sticks out in my mind, god only knows why, is what I throw 1k at and then sell it at the open... rinse, wash, repeat.
i swear i feel like i've been watching a movie on wsb this entire week! gains for everyone! haha!

GIK kept me in the green today, I’m going to ride this baby to 30$ and beyond ✈️
Fucking dead
715 EST
Even during the after hours we are bulls show them show them all WSB are truly full of degenerates
Thoughts on ICLN 4/16 35C?
will i be able to sell a call tomorrow?
Just bought 100 shares of GME at the top to sell a FD call on. IV is juicy
Tim🍎 screw you bitch
what's his channel called?
107k wall at 40.00 on GME? Lul
It's in God's hands now bois
Got 92c and 96c AMD FDs, need some fucking prayers
You don’t pay taxes if it’s on robinhood read their policy
I just added 13.8k to my GME position so i really hope it fucking skyrockets tomorrow
Alright sleepy joe, you know what to do now
Sir, this is a casino.
SAME FUCK
Already 1.15M volume AH on GME
Not me 💎 🙌
YESSIRR
the number hasn't even been unveiled
The question is: what does the peak of the squeeze look like?
If you fulfill the requirements and pass a test, you get a PE license and almost guaranteed promotion/title change and raise. If you don't get those things, you almost certainly go to a company that gives you those things. It's a pretty standard thing in the industry. It has some more responsibility but not necessarily a significant amount.
i heard he's talking about GME
Bought a amzn 1/15 3200c lotto at close. Im so poor idk why i did it im a fucking degenerate
Big bois holding it down for themselves for after-hours
HOLDING AND BUYING MOAR.
What's his channel?
105k GME shares for sale at 40.00..
. Wut?
Ridin the GME 🚀 to the 🌝
You’re the problem.
To the moon! Or $100. Which ever comes first.
Tim Apple need to flip this shit
didn’t have the balls to hold all my 1/15 GME calls, so i sold half.

then bought shares at market price 😈
These naked shorts, I am sure did not do their locates before shorting GME.
Anything that you can use to add rockets in front of a ticker to
thanks a lot guys. Holding on. love you.
I made $0.28 today.  


Obviously I wasn't in on GME today.
It broke $40 twice today, just hold. It'll hit $60 tomorrow before market close.
someone better find jack ma soon so i can kill him myself
yep, all forms of this happened, the question is how much is naked short options that were in turn quickly hedged with equity. I'm estimating 90%. Maybe its 95%. Maybe it's 70% maybe it's 50%. But it's significant no matter what it is.
I'm sure most addicts find a way to get their fix no matter the damage is causes to their life.
Man the harpoons!
Hopefully an investment fund puts some money into woof I need those big tendies
ICLN will print for sure
First the WSJ, then the World 🚀

Well first off you should start during market hours
Ah I’m holding for 6 months no matter what.
Sold my BB $8 weeklies I bought yesterday right at the top for a fucking 45 bagger. Absolutely ridiculous should have bought more than 10
Lol sorry
I held FB for way too long! I'll be glad I sold when it's down in the 1-hundreds again. Garbage company.
Cashed out my 1/15 40c for 24k profit. Let’s ride this bitch to Valhalla 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I thought green energy or something. Maybe. Either way green energy makes green numbers in my account.
Well that was an eventful day.

 \+$8.52 (+27.13%) Today  GME  


Damn
AMD is just fueling up for its next run. I believe in you!
What is behind the GME surge?
I bought 1 44c
I'm broke so I can only afford one BB contract. 12.5c on 1/22
How did u calculate the value of these stocks?
I like to own a few amount of stocks where i know the business.
For example a small game company where i can calculate sales and profit numbers from their upcoming games.
This way my discounted cash flow are quite accurate in the short term.
If your valuation of the company is lower and u really believe in it and their product, u should hold long term.


I dont know to much about Nio , but their valuation is close to Toyota.
This worries me since i would not expect them to sell as many cars as Toyota.
Also the worry is an highly competitive market and a Chinese brand.
Many world wide see Chinese products as inferior since many flawed products come from there.
I work in the car business and Chinese cars a big no due to them becoming valueless very quickly.
So it would take time for them to change this imagine.

I do love Tesla a lot, i have been a fan for many years.
And they plan to become a battery business.
The factories are the product according to Elon Musk.
They want to produce 3 THW of battieres in 2030.
At 50 dollar per kwh that is 150 billion in revenue and at 100 it is 300 billion.
Then you would get the revenue from the car manufactering.
Plus the self driving car software which is highest margin.
Ans the taxi software they would use.
So if you believe Elon musk you can derive the cash flows from that and make ur calculation.
But remember it could also not pan out the way Elon wants.

And diversification can be good if you think these stock are overvalued or could have a drop.
But only with stocks u know are undervalued of course.
Not pure for the diversifacation.

One problem that i see is, that there seems to be am EV bubble.
Even for companies that have no future for profitablity.
So thats why u should be wary.
-$432 for the day.

I've got a shit load of GME calls expiring tomorrow 1/15.  $5k in total.

23x $50

5x $49

5x $55

1x $45

1x $40
Whos buying $BB?? 🚀🚀🚀

If you want to lose half of your money overnight, yes, absolutely
And what happens if it’s more/less than what you’re betting it’ll be?

Thank you sir, you were right. I doubted us at first but I didn't sell.

Gotta love the superiority complex on r/stocks because some people are new to stocks. Jesus Chris the dudes just telling his experience and y’all feel the need to tell him how much better you are then him.
Fanfriggigtastic!... is what I'd be saying if I didn't paper hand my GME $21 1/15 C

Seems like a good stock to go long on. I see Affirm offered on like every website I use.
I'm banned on Twitter for shit posting too much. I'm gonna check out club stonk right now on discord.
Wow this is either insane or brilliant , what’s gonna be the next move or is it still GME? Have a few euro to throw at something 
I had seen about GME on WSB but I honestly thought it was going nowhere , well done boys
This makes me feel better. Thank you.

Practically everyone who rents a car...usually the only time I ever listen to XM or Sirius
MORE HOLD = MORE MONEY
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHY GME IS GOING UP OTHER THAN AUTISTIC PUMPS!?? 

I mean I love it but I want the logical side of my brain to stop bugging me
Keep selling OTM calls, I think near term it’s going to consolidate
Waiting on Daddy Biden to pump ICLN with all the stimmys.
I see a beautiful stimmy and a brilliant people rising from this abyss.
   
I see the stocks for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy.
   
I see that I hold a GME share in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence.
   
It is a far, far better moon that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better tendies that I go to than I have ever known.
I think if this ER beats and they go positive we ride to Valhalla
I got more WOOF on that dip , EZ money

Hey! Don’t you say mean things to us retards!

Why is SPCE tanking AH?
You guys are god damn wizards with the words and stuff.

TL:DR  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**
Closed my GME 1/15 33c EoD. Rolled some into 1/29 40s, used profits to buy 200 shares to hold.
Picked up a 2/5/21 10.5c last week for 0.04 and I'm loving this rocket. If Tesla holds then I think it pulls up Ford and GM hard.
Oh, I’m not doubting that, but I think there’s some probably more pressing matters that get handled first before we start legalizing pot. It’s not if, it’s when. I’m in on tilray leaps at 10c bought before the new year.

I think big alcohol should be worried, because this is their next big competitor.
Thank you so much for all this can’t thank you enough
Went in big at 3:59 for GME.  Lets hope it pans out.
Watchlisted
Europoors better not dump GME 😐
LETS GO GME!! TOMORROW WE FEAST!! KEEP GOING!!
Please TAN recover
Bought 2x 1/22 GME 50c. Hope for another $8 day tomorrow
Bend over and let me show you
Melvin might try to drive the price down AH with little volume. I wouldn't trust it.
You're so right I am a 🐻 at 40
22 average. Still holding cuz I love money
Where at
400k shares GME bought at close

100k sell wall at 40
What’s up with GOEV?
106k sell wall at $40 goddamn
My wife and I have a joint bank account ever since getting married. I still have around $10k in my old savings account from when I was single (separate bank) that is basically just sitting there. We want to know what os the best way to invest that 10k to make our money grow for us. 

We are both in our very late 20s.

We are both employed full time making around 90k combined.

We both have 401ks through our jobs, but I don't know if they match dollar for dollar

Our objectives with this money are simply to make it grow. It can take 10 years, 20 years, or 30 years for all we care, we just want it to grow so we can have a comfortable retirement, maybe buy a house at some point, and leave a nice inheritance for our future kids.

Our time horizon is more long term. 20+ years at least

No current holdings. All our wealth is in our 2 bank account that I already mentioned. We don't own property or anything like that.

Big debts: around $100k in student loans. Currently on a 10 year payment plan. Just over $1000/mo for payments. Idk the interest rate, it's my wife's. 

As far as other relevant info, we would be more interested in a passive, long-term approach ('set and forget'). Not opposed to something more active, but I wouldn't wanna have to be checking every day or treating it like a second job. If it was more a monthly thing, that wouldn't be too bad. 

We figure now is a good time since a lot of stuff is still lower than it was pre-pandemic, though we definitely realize we should have started back in march. Any help is appreciated.
LETS GO GME YOU FUCKING GET THEM BOY
That’s the thing. FB has by far the most profitable business model, far superior to snap and Twitter. I’m not super bullish on the growth of snap and twitters monetization going forward. I don’t think they will ever reach fbs level, just because of the essence of the platforms. 
Therefore, I don’t see snap or Twitter as very interesting growth investments. 

And as I said FB has the makings on paper as a really great and undervalued stock but there is something about it that has cursed it to lag. Some will say it’s the threats of government regulation and a potential breakup, imo it has more to do with the fact that most people seem to absolutely hate FB and their business practices. Therefore, in the day of ESG investing (Environmental, Social, Governance) they will always lag.
$35.75... fucking GOEV and ICLN man
Good work everyone. The fire rises tomorrow
nobody gives a fuck GTFO
You idiots convinced me to buy ICLN calls don’t let me down
Now, don't wait til spring
Alibaba is getting into EV as well...
Im all in on GME but you need to watch out for cloud gaming because its growing fast, and now that its in the interest of Google and many megacorporations to give people fast, cheap, accesible internet cloud gaming could pose a threat to GME long term.

Dont get me wrong I am all in and GME is still 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Sleepy Joe don’t cuck me pls. My portfolio is already in shambles & you’re the one to dictate how much more deep it goes 🤡

Bought some GME fds to my shares expecting 45-50 tomorrow

Yessir buying and holding until we crash land on Jupiter 🪐🚀💎

Yes, it’s a valid strategy. Note that he was a Vice-President at DE Shaw before Amazon, so he knows what he’s talking about. Your volatility will be much higher, but if you can stomach the drops, you’re going to be better off in the long run.
You got no clue what I’m talking about unfortunately it seems. No part of what I said was referencing the stock. It was an attempt to help you understand the deep dogmatic hinderances of thought you allow yourself to perceive life through due to your ideological thinking
Can you not option trade ah?
Why should we hate on you?  You've already shown you hate yourself.
So if it hits 40 after hours do the calls still count?
Just saw this. Unfortunately trading212 doesn’t do post and pre market trading and my order 2 minutes before market close didn’t go through. Seems like a good play will be watching it tomorrow

Not full time just take a class per semester 

I might even teach at local communities

What I don’t like is while socializing being ask to do tech support....
On one contract, yes
I didn't think this was an additional offering, I thought they were selling a total of $332.5M in shares at $9.5. There's a big difference between the two.
Any love for $APHA? Been on a run since before the Georgia runoffs but plenty of room left to grow! Just grabbed more shares this AM.

Sell all of it and put it in GME WE WILL COVER THE STREETS IM THEIR TEARS AND BECOME THEIR WIVES BOYFRIENDS
Create selling pressure. Causes others to sell
You're welcome and no problem. Happy to do it.
Growth doesn't apply that much to NEE as it does to other smaller companies (considering it's high PE and actual market share that it can still take in North America). It is not like the population of the US will double or NEE will invest in another large sized country.
Possible if merger happens. If not we're screwed.
they're not itm. These are 41 to 55 which were added this morning. Previously the max was 40.

Vague threat of delisting in 3 years and political squabbling between US and China is something to mention however unlikely they be be to occur
Let's go, power hour kids... GME gonna gap up 5 bucks tonight, get in here
Feels like there's hardly anyone playing AMD anymore. I'm literally all in at the moment with $97.5 / $100 calls. How fucked do you think we are
phamp it
buy GME!!!
Tomorrow is the day a lot of short positions expire. Potential for a big jump up.
sold at 33 and bought at 35.6.

SPCE just dumped 3% in 3 mins. I’m fucked
This scale is likely ranging from TIPs as 1 to emerging markets as 5. I don’t think Vanguards scale includes WSB yolo’s.
That's why I asked the question in this thread. Guaranteed rate said they didn't care where the money came from.

Opened sizeable positions in SFM and OZON

You broke it, I bought options on RH an hour ago.
Double king today damn!
TDA’s P&L % is kinda messed up. They mark it against the price of the options, not the capital at risk (margin). If you really made 75% your account would be much higher than $100k. I suggest you (mentally) mark profits against your maximum loss (i.e. the margin locked by the open position.)
Who lost money today? 🙋‍♂️
I bought 70 shares of $BB today using $GME gains.  Is this how we roll?
you got this. Let's hold and go to the moon.
What time does the after market close
Holding 5k in AMD calls over night. I think I’ll do some stress drinking tonight.
Bought two more calls and holding 100 shares. I’m nuts deep in GME rn and I love it
I don't think the short percentage really went down based on the movement today.

If it has a plug, it's gonna make you rich atm. It is even enough if the company proposes to create something with a plug in the future, just announce talks about possibly merging with a SPAC in the future and see this SPAC mooning.
If your plug-attached device has tires, even better. If it can connect to the internet as well, it's time to get some 500% YoY-level hype.

Fucking TSLA. Opened at $843 and closed at $844. I guess I should be thankful all things considered.
at first, i thought you might have had your settings wrong for your chart but i checked another and got different numbers. not sure what's up, but whatever technicals i was looking at were spot on — made 50% profit in an hour of trading
Check out https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/

If you really want to learn and you use Robinhood, this video is as good as it gets:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms

You should really be thinking of options as just that, options. You are paying a **premium** to buy a **contract** which gives you the option to **buy 100 shares** at the desired **strike price** anytime from now until the **expiration date**. You can **exercise** this option at anytime, or you can sell the contract back for a profit/loss.

But yes, it's essentially a "bet." I think that video explains all you need to know. Watch it in chunks so you don't overwhelm yourself.

This is the fucking way
ALL HAIL THE KING 🚀🚀🚀
Man you lost me so hard at Emmy award winning Cuckmo.
No I'm still holding it. The market value of 500 shares is less than $20 now. That one crashed hard. I don't think that one is coming back. I think there were a couple more that I sold for +/-10%, nothing notable. I completely missed the moment they had that year. 

Yea Marijuana stocks seem like they are rough lately. I was looking at some ETFs and they were down too. I have been keeping an eye on Planet 13 since they seem decent and are headquartered in my city but have not bought anything yet.
Hoes mad
Sold what i could and threw most of it into ICLN... please biden please dont fuck this up
Is there any other way to do stockers
Dropping AH as I type
not SPY

maybe IWM and weed penny stocks
I never should’ve touched a Tesla option this week lmao. Oh well maybe we’ll get a 20% bump tomorrow 😒
Thanks dood
65% of my portfolio is still TSLA
Save us Señor Biden
Not a very bull like answer
🚀
Okay, this is my literal last time trading QQQ, big tech you fucking boomer stocks. literally done ive lost too much of my profits on that stupid shit. Same with you too SPY, yall can die
Holding 55 shares of bb
I’ll be there!!!
Tomorrow Melvin put expiry you know
Had PTON 170 FD's that were ITM like 6 times today and I still held.

I am fucking retarded...got bull trapped like 6 fucking times fml
OUR KING HAS SPOKEN ONCE AGAIN
This is worse than any crash. This is death by papercuts 🥶
Spy looking no bueno gonna be a sell the news event
NIO building factory in just two months wtf
What a virgin
AMD 1/22 95c is just....man, if ever there were free money in a big name, that's it.
Tesla is the future. Today's price will look like peanuts 10 years from now

Don't be left behind. Join this winning ticket
I went into FCEL 🌚
pls no
TO THE TITS
CCIV
Spy calls 1/15
ICLAN calls 1/15
Vale calls 1/15
Because in order to execute that option, you have to actually have the money to purchase those stocks, which most autistics retards here, do not, so they sell the option under the total value such that someone else will buy and exercise the contract.

The reason why you would want to buy options instead of stocks is that you can buy "the right" to buy a LOT more stocks vs if you just bought stocks in the first place, giving you a lot more return when you sell that option.
When you retards are right you are right...this is gonna benefit a lot of us.
Expecting a further dip tomorrow
Bought the SPY and TSLA dip but they kept dipping...
# GME - Keep em💎hands

Also - **BB** to pop further
God Among Us.
What does that mean?
well its at 0.2 now
GME level 2 💀🤳
To the moon!!!
we can't hate on you as much as you hate money
everyone buying the retarded and gay 55s instead of stock. They're gonna lose their money lmao
They need to make a movie of Wall Street Bets
Not even God has that foresight.

GME
Today was a refueling mission, another tight channel as did on Tuesday. Tomorrow we hit $60 

Buy shares, not weeklies!

🚀 🚀 🚀 

Hoard: 15.9k shares @ $15 cost basis and ~150 calls (Apr/Jul)
Always has been 🧑‍🚀🔫
We may have 💎🙌🏻  but you have a 💎🍆

You deserve every single cent you earned. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
It's free debt lmao 75% of it pays no interest. And their debt to asset ratio is still great.
Now:  mortgage rates are at their lowest, once people who aren’t in their 60’s get their vaccines (implying the economy will open up) rates will jump
Ur not too late for bb gang
PFE open $50 tomorrow
Nice one. I am +50 already. Fuck the money. I just want love from the sub
We haven't won yet!
Do not sell! 💎👐
Don’t know why I did it. I never diamond hand shit to worthless. But here I am with a TSLA 855c FD that is going to most likely be worthless losing 3k. 

GME keeping me up so kind of held on to hope this time. So instead of bailing at 1k loss I made enough that 3k “didn’t really hurt”. 

I’m a dumbass 🤡
So many tendies
FUCK YES - HAIL THE KING
BB gang. All my homies buying BB
more like $70
nice
That's a lot of numbers before the period
What are your current positions? What should we put our life savings into?
Not the way...
GME closed above its top yesterday. I dont know a lot about Technical Astrology, but i know thats bullish AF. Another round tomorrow for the GME GANG.
Roaring Kitty
How many articles about WSB today bois? We out here. Wall Skreet better recognize
Tomorrow is going to be fun watching the GME chart
Just bought 40 shares .
yeah.. to many to choose from.. just getting SPY weeklies for next week
God is risen
I held 50% 🚀
Can you explain why exactly?
Joe Biden talks like an 82 year old porky pig
Who would have thought GME would be a better investment than TSLA over the last year
Biden won, China won.

I got the memo last year from the Trump campaign. /s
Over on weedstocks you cannot find a single comment without APHA 😂
Share thoughts on what? You haven't said anything.
Hey you assholes left me behind in the other thread.
*nuts in pants
After making this comment I FOMO into 70 shares of $BB after a 20% runup today.  Here's to good news!!!
Why Tuesday?
zuck the cuck me
3 days on the job with my CDL, just got pulled over for a seatbelt ticket. If he gives me a warning, I’ll drop 5k on GME next week
Behind the dumpster at Wendy’s
Knew that 500 block on 1/15 20c was you.
Well that was fucking rough

on a side note, does anyone else find women x10 more attractive when they’re financially literate? idk what it is. Maybe I just need to get me a Cathie. Hmm.
Rode some 1/15 377s for decent profit thanks... let’s bring those fucks down

Technically you'll only have a certain number of boners in your life. Don't let one go to waste. The number goes down everyday...
Hope Melvin has nightmares tonight. 😈
Dude. Hell of a call out. Thank you!
Fucking TSLA. Opened at $843 and closed at $844. I guess I should be thankful all things considered.
Amen.
KING
🤞🏻Come on Buyden. Make our portfolios moon. This one speech will determine how much dick I get this year.
From what I can understand, us autists. They hired some new guy on the board and everyone went apeshit
Everything on sale kinda. Buy the dip.

No problem, right?
The reason why I first subscribed is back.
Nio opening over 63 heard it here first
GME
how dare you
I own one as well so I never make bad decisions
Glad it worked out for you. I sold my calls yesterday because I was worried about IV crush, but kept my shares. APHA doing well helped my TLRY calls. 😘
Puts on your time management bud.
what’s next week?
Sold 50% 🚀
Thank you for doing your part
Biden lockdown bullish?
Haha good point
/u/deepfuckingvalue when you doing your update, another milly added today at least for sure yeah? btw enjoyed your u tubes
2 AM
BB LETS GO
lol
YOU CLOSED THE 1/15's????
2/19 $10c LFG 🚀 🚀 🚀
So how did you GMElords make out today?
No
simply bullish
Look at the short data lmao.

Only 40k shares to borrow with a 46% borrow rate 

Yah bro. Hasn’t even squeezed yet.
You finally sold the calls!!! Great work man, really big fan.
I am ready to work GME all...year...long.
If anyone with enough dedication could make 30% every 2 months, they’d quadruple their portfolio every year.
That trend for 10 years is about 69,000 x your money back.

Please be careful, this market is not normal, and you cannot and should not expect to make that big a return consistently. You’re likely investing in high risk stocks, which are just as likely to crater at some point.


Congrats on the gains though!
IM GONNA GUSHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
90% of shopping still done in store 🚀🚀🚀
What a piece of shit day
I watched that baby drop in at 4pm on the dot.
noooooo TLRY dont die AH
GME and BB looking great for tomorrow
What do you see
Generally you want to buy a call weeks to months out from its expiration date, not the day before. You may be able to sell the contract tomorrow just because of how nuts GME is rn, but in the future you’ll loose money on a play like that 99/100 times.
What’s this now? High today was $41
My wife is waiting!!!
I LOVE YOU 💎🙌
GME selloff/profit taking tomorrow?
Biden better not fuck up my 1/15 spy calls
Congratulations! 👏 👏👏🚀🚀🚀🚀
I have the following calls all expiring tomorrow (bought 30 mins ago):

GME $40,

SPY $380,

BABA $250,

BB $9.50,

ICLN $33,

QQQ $318,

BA $215,

NAVI $12.50
#GME-aggedon tomorrow.
People were talking about BB far before that, you’re the one needing to catch on you autist
I dont think BIden will speak about clean energy today unfortuantely. I also will be in bed by the time he speaks becuase I now sleep early and start m day at 4 am on WSB in the pre-market.
Got an FD for next friday haha
What’s his channel?
Never thought I'd fall in love.... but then I met GME
in the dip we trust
They sell heroin
Betz AH 👀
PLTR already shot its rocket and needs a minute to recover.

BB rocket is starting to rattle with the door open for a minute longer. Jump the fuck in 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💦
This site is roughly the same size as the Shanghai gigafactory btw.
So I'm not a complete idiot for buying at today's peak?
I stuck it in dry to BB today. All GME gains will go to BB after the squeeze has been completed tomorrow.
they're attacking AH. Don't let them win this easily.
People finally realizing CNK is a good recovery play.
Plz god just one more 20%+ day and I’ll be a happy man
Absolute legend
Tried explaining this legend to my wife this morning, and all she cared to ask is if DeepFuckingValue is single.
Keep buying pltr. it's going to print on demo day.
What exactly is a sell wall and why is it there?
SHARES

Deep value before you leave please for a retard like me is it ok to buy now or should I stay out

What are we thinking about CLWD after that performance today?
Damn I went bigger on ICLN than GME.
GOAT!! TO THE MOON
This better be the biggest stimulus package the world has ever seem. Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody in the future. Need some fire liquidity in the stock market to raise these prices.
GME is legitimately weaponized autism
Everyone anxiously waiting for gamecock to drop his dong
What a fun day for GME gang. Can’t wait for tomorrow and the forthcoming celebration this weekend

I haven't compared their top competitor's finances but I saw that they're sitting at 30 I'd like to hold long enough to see it hit that high. Slow and steady winds the race. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Is that even still a thing?... lmao
AMD 93c 1/29 at close ... pleas for earnings!
Likelihood of bankruptcy is lower than forecasted. New team that turned Chewy into a monster. Heavy shorts that need to cover by buying.
Damn wish I could gamble with 100K like that. I FOMOed 10k into GME this morning and my ass is sweating.

I also got in at 44. Wouldn’t be amazed if they expired worthless but this seems like the kind of week to double down with profits and really make some hay.

sell when you are at your level of profits, you do not need to hold until the last second at all. You could wake up to big gains at open tomorrow and sell immediately.

Dad?
Is PLTR heavily shorted? I am seeing a pretty modest short interest around 6% of float despite the public Citron shorting. Can you provide a source?

...Which means we will drill to the earths core.
Nice example. I believe I understand most of the concepts around dividend investing, but what would have been the returns if you had invested in an S&P500 index fund such as SPY or FNILX over the same time frame?
Told my girlfriend about GME and bashing Melvin Capital. She just bought 5000 shares this morning...
I bought at 34 this morning then was a pussy bitch at $36. Now I’m back in at $38 and I’ve just said goodbye to that money. If you really love something you need to let it go
You’re retarded

And I love it.

Did anyone else notice that the S&P went down .35% today? Practically everything on my watchlist was up >5%, what actually went down? Sector rotation out of boomer shit and into memes?
You won't be able to trade options in the UK, however you can trade CFDs or spread bets which both allow you to leverage you money. Just be aware of your margin and ensure you have sufficent funds for your position.

Let it ride, unless you have a solid idea about something that will outperform NIO, **PLUS** make you back that capital gains tax to the government.
Hop out at open with whatever profit you have IMO. I’d be stunned if it gapped down over night but $44 is a little risky for my taste
For how long

You're right, seems like it's not as cut and dry as I thought. They do have best results in the NHTSA tests, even if that doesn't necessarily mean they're the safest under all circumstances.

That said, Googling "safest car" is a terrible source, as all the top hits are car magazines and websites which are always doing paid reviews. They're about as neutral as your average Capitol-storming republican commenting on Trump's actions.

Someone bought over 600,000 shares of AMD at close 👀
BB TO THE DUCKING MOON🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
TLRY
I converted my Roth into cash and bought 660 more shares at 31. 1650 shares total @ 21.17 avg. I’m tempted to paper my Roth and diamond my brokerage—but beats me if I know what my exit strategy is.
BB
With IV in the 600-700% range calls need like 20-30% movement just to keep from going red lol
It's a long term hold, hope you got in under the meme price (30)
My gme gain today https://imgur.com/lrw94kM (+$8k on rh)

Yesterday: https://imgur.com/iRiNr9X
I feel sorry for anyone dumbass who doesn’t get in gme lmao
... in case anyone missed it the other 10x it was posted?
Who else held GME calls overnight??
Icln
Yeah sure... With cashflows being reduced every year and sales falling... Good luck
Lol the after hours. Chunks like 50 cents at a time.
97,500 sell wall at $40 on GME. They trying hard aInT they.
i guess that negates my point
I agree. if ET7 preorders are off the charts too it's gonna be amazing.
7:15
Shorts need to cover, there aren’t enough shares available to. Price action so far has only been people chasing squeeze, with only minor shorts closing positions.
MY GOD HE’S STILL HOLDING 🚀🚀🚀🚀
BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Looks like Shitron did their usual BS - this time on LMND.  You know what that means: buy the shit out of it tomorrow.
Tesla 900 tomorrow?
Don’t let the gme swarm see this they’ll give you shit for not playing their retarded roulette
7:15 est
My dude! 🥳
You will be up tomorrow.
Can the value get any deeper?

I’m sending you a pizza if you end up being right
1000000% ded
Got my jammies on, ready to rock
Lmfao I asked this question for a different ticker too, (BBBY) and saw your answer without seeing which question it was for and took profit on that. Hahahahahaha. Oh well. They’re deep ITM so will be fine either way
How do you open up a trading account on you phone or PC can someone give me a link to start off
when are we rotating back into big tech??
GME, APHA, TLRY, PLTR

Completely unrelated to the stock here but how is the Robinhood gold for the pre market evaluation?
Whats going on with GME is neither bearish or bullish, its autistic.
I'm new to all this, is it possible to point me to the direction where I can find the result of the hearing? I've managed to find that hearing is @ 9am but that's pretty much
This is exactly what happens.
So when should we sell GME?
 And by  the time you can close the position at the opening bell, you'll be -50%
If you chumps ruined ICLN and it dumps after Biden’s announcement my disappointment will be immeasurable
The mad lad did it!
So we are all in on ICLN? Fuck. Alright let’s get this money
Pleas
WHERE THE FUCK IS THE DEEPFUCKINGVALUE UPDATE
MARA on fire now
Where we dropping Bois
What is this shares thing you speak of? Is that some boomer shit I’m too retarded to understand?
Same here. I have only 500 shares at 2.25. Hopefully they will fulfill by Q2. Either way $500 investment if I lose.
Absolutely yes
Wife her
🚀?
Guh I thought I bought the dip around 330 just to get wrecked on that flash crash out of nowhere. Hope you got in on that. That took me down 35% on my FD alone. So stupid
i hope so. been annoyingly sideways the last few days
Yooooo this is hilarious and 100% accurate.
GME, here we go 👇
Just the sheer audacity that he held fucking 1000 Jan 15 $20 calls this entire time despite them being very OTM is what gets me. And then the week they expire the stock fucking moons.

You’re one lucky bastard with the biggest balls I’ve ever seen
I hesitated but hope y'all the best!!
SPY puts will print :)
GME GOING TO SQUEEEXEE even harder for the long weekend! free our shares no more IOUs.
GME rocket tomorrow 🚀

Shut up stupid
I hope Cathie's daughter accepts my linkedin request
Just sold a bunch of covered GME 55C options expiring tomorrow as the IV is wild. I'm safe, right?
Why are people reacting negatively to Biden’s stimulus package? This makes no sense
will my 100 GME 55C print tomorrow?
he bet on GME before anyone else here. Has made over $7m with like under $100k.
I have been burning through my money buying and bag holding SPY puts bc I’m a permabear. Bought calls on this dip to inverse myself. If Biden becomes a sell the news event I’m gonna be pissed
No, $45 AH today.
Stonks always grow up. Sell her while she’s worth something. Don’t want to get stuck with that bag.
The volume on those GME calls is massive lol
Mofo KING!
I think you have the right idea of having more concentrated holdings. That said, 5k-10k is a decent mark to build a new position in another sector
You guys think it’s u/DeepFuckingValue holding that sell wall at $40?
I sold BB for GME in December… I do not regret selling.
Holy Fuck, PFE still isn’t $40
Talk yo shit Biden
0dte SPY 380c for the win
Sorry baby I trade futures
I will follow you into Valhalla. All in on GME shares as of today. 

👑 KING OF THE TARDS ⚔️

Some paper handed bitch is selling 107k shares at $40

Whoever you are, stop being such a pussy
👋🏻
Yea noticed that today each time we touched 40. I’m sure We can break through with the volume we have
there are a set of characters who patronize every public library-
1. Porn Guy
2. Manga kid
3. Homeschool Mom w/ too many kids
4. White trash lady who wants you to know that she pays your salary so you work for her, so 'no' she will not pay her overdue fine.
5. Bored retiree who is really into birdwatching or ancestry, and needs help googling stuff
6. Asian 'tiger' mom, disappointed in her kids for reading 'dumb' (YA fiction) books, and forces them to check out textbooks instead
7. Old hippies wanting to do a political thing and needing to print out fliers, and they radicalize you during the 8 minutes you spent with them 
9. Romance novel lady wearing a sweatshirt w/ a cat on it. Checks out like, 30 romance novels every 3 days.
10. TEENAGERS. The absolute worst. They smell like weed and for some reason, you're scared of them.
About 100k sell orders at $40
No mentions of us holding. She's a Melvin lover. Trying to make it seem like itw over. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 cunt
Reverse interest

Can any of you guys explain why it was so high in 2008/ why it dipped so significantly? Did they change their holdings? Was there Obama administration hype that didn’t deliver?
Pls don’t get my hopes up.
There's also a stupid amount of people who are all in on max margin on Tesla shares. The margin calls hit...look out belowwwww

oh baby yes
Don’t worry about the protests this weekend.  They will knock it off by Monday out of respect for MLK day.
MY LEIGE
GME
New to investing, just kind of putting around with a small amount of cash and a small portfolio. Trying to learn ins and outs of short term investing(2-5 years). I have some long term ETF's which I'll buy periodically. 

Today, I have a question about a certain circumstance.

I have 10 shares of Aphria that shot up 25% after their earnings report. In this instance, would it be wise to:

* Sell for 25% profit and rebuy when hype dies.
* Hold and invest more when hype dies.

The whole basis around investing in them is that they may be very profitable in the growing cannabis industry. My gut says hold, because cannabis isn't going anywhere and the price may only increase going forward. My gut may also be very, very wrong.

Thanks friends!
Are you familiar with the concept of renting?
Be very careful with who you take advice from. Most people lose money in the markets as do the majority of day traders. 

Diversification at your age is a mistake. Ignore that. You should be building wealth and you do that by concentrating. You can diversify later when its time to protect your gains.
138% of shares are shorted at the moment
Thanks!
Yep called it back in 2019.
INNNNNNNN @500 shares
look at his post history
You are fun.  Keep the stocks coming.
Buy LMND?
GME had two big known catalysts. One, enormous short position. Two, a console refresh in late 2020.

The gamble was this, would they get through COVID without going bankrupt. They did. Ta da.
yes
$2.6M oh baby
🚀
Bro I’m so fucking happy for you. I genuinely hope you’re not just some rich fucker who already had millions and that this is life changing money. Glad to see you scaling some cash out of the markets too.
hey guys, idk about you, but im used to decades of the govt jerkin my chain.. if theyre telling us to stick it in further, does this actually mean we about to be fukd and should pull out fast af?
🤝
SPCE dumped 3% in 3 minutes. I might be fucked
We buying BB stock on our iPhones in 2021. Oh the irony
Big tech went down like 1.5% across the board.
Me brother
Read the comments, it’s a banned ticker. Post gets automodded with the ticker visible.
this is spam.
we only has 15-20 min of high volume on GME today and we pumped to $43. if volume from yesterday shows up tomorrow, we may see $50
Should I sell PLTR and buy BB?
13 @$18 checking in
No sense getting tested and clogging up labs if you're not sick. The actual rate of asymptomatic transmission are very low. Just wear a mask and if you start feeling lousy, stay home and get a test.

LEGEND OF THE MEME 👑👑

BB - $11 call but I think that was too safe. See it going to $12.

GME - $49 call, but it's going to fucking 60 baby lets fucking goooooooooo
You dropped this  👑
What's your logic for closing OSTK?
Few thoughts for ya:

First, do you know what IV is? If so, think about what it was when you bought and what it is now and why that happened (look at the chart right up to where you bought in and then what happened after). If not, learn about IV and see above.

Second, think about the theta you're going against (same as above, if you deal with options you -must- understand IV and theta) with a Jan 15 call this far out of the money.

I say this stuff not be an ass or anything, but because I murdered myself last year doing the same types of plays as you and I've now learned how much more important it is to save for those LEAPs (also so you can synthetic covered call and sell the pop for a nice diagonal spread). Just some thoughts, but I would imagine your assessment of selling those contracts on open is probably wise, although honestly you may find no buyers. Good luck out there man, and keep learning about options, it gets better!
Just a shit ton of sell orders at a certain price that needs to be boight up for price to go above. There was one at GME 39.50ish candles keep bouncing off it
GET BACK IN you still have time its early days
The dilution typically comes when companies are trying to raise capital.
Not exactly; many other countries (even entire *continents*) have the government encouraging investing & speculation.  All of Europe prints money/quantative easing.  They've even had negative interest rates, which means you need to pay the bank to leave your money there.  Not even 'Murica' does that.  Heck, we don't even have 0% rates.  Pretty close, as they're "0 - 0.25%"
Did you learn a lesson?
lol no, squeeze of all squeezes
Getting in on BB now is like getting in on the early days of the internet.
is that Biden on lemonparty.com
So is TLRY
Mods?
Can't remember the last time I was this leveraged to the tits. Probably last Monday. New year same me.
I am greeeeeeen
I am down to my last $100 that my bitch ex wife didn’t take in child support. Gods of WSB shine some light on me and help me make some fucking tendies please. I need to show my ex-wife boyfriend my PP is actually not smol. Give me 💎✋🏽

(Gonna YouTube options now. Yolo)
I am appalled that this sub and others managed to make BB moon.
Watch ELY rise, maybe some bbby
if youre a UK or EU citizen i can share some great ETFs for you, or you can find the US equivalents
Tomorrow might just be a dream maker. A ton of FDs on GME for Stim + more squeezing. 

Going to be hard to sleep tonight!
Obviously he bought at the top retards
Because that was the way of investing in the past and people regurgitate the same boomer advice

Broad index investing is fine but why be comfy with 7% annual growth when you can do 50% instead 

There's never been a better time for stock picking
Yes, because it’s only concentrated in one country, one continent, one currency, the big companies like Apple are way over weighted as a risk, the US stock market may has outperformed other markets for a time but past performance is not indicator for future performance and the increasingly unstable political situation with socialism/anti capitalism from the left leaning democrats. Only true Americans invest 100% in the S&P 500
CDU lefties ? Are you retarded ?
That's not a good option for me, but thanks for the advice.
I want and need BB to 10$ by open
Oh shit blue origin human flight by April 👀👀
Is it financially irresponsible if I invest in a call debit spread with only 2k. I can't possibly cover 100 shares of stock in the event of assignment. Also, if I am assigned, will I go into massive debt or will Robinhood just exercise the buy call and leave me to pay the difference. Also, can I avoid this risk but closing a CDS a week or two in advance of the expiration date? Thanks for the help mate.
How can you not trust the guys running the company. That’s all the DD I NEED

"We've seen this play out, it's a bit shit"

> So a homeless person with no assets, but $100,000 in the S&P.

It's quite conceivable for somebody to live at home with parents and put every penny that they earn into investment accounts.

Does the math not add up?  Do you not think that a stock market crash ruins people's lives?  Destroys families?  The S&P dropped 30%, but what about individual stocks? 

I think we're getting off topic here, so I'll ask again:  Does losing 1/3 of your net worth in less than 60 days seem risky?
This is the "Avengers Endgame" equivalent of this series. Bravo.
You made me look at what it started at.

What a day to end up close to even lol.

Means there's another battle to happen.

The middle of the battle has always had a peak that is higher..

If I see anyone post in the discussion thread tomorrow how sad they are that they sold at 40 When it hits 45-50 I will go out of my way to downvote you
Revisiting this you called it right with your original post. Only time will tell if we keep heading this direction but hope you made some gains from the uncertainty today
100 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I really spent my whole day trying to buy puts on MSTR when the whole time I just needed to press the call button instead and make thousands smh
Jumped the gun at the open, but that beautiful bastard gained it all back
Tomorrow tech will lead and IWM will drill.
Buy the BBs for Friday:

BB

BBY gonna surprise at earnings

BBBY gonna squeeze.

GME finish the squeeze.
I mean, good luck and I hope you're right BUT... Gamestop is a place where parents and other relatives go to buy games for gamers. And, not only is there a definite trend AWAY from physical game copies by the console makers of the world, there are now mounting reasons why nobody wants to go to a retail store.
 Plus, if you happen to be a gamer, then you'll already know how shitty Gamestop is for buying and selling games.
This guy secretly shadow stalks WSB, saw the GME DD over the last few months, and is pissed with envy that he didn’t buy and is missing the rocket ship. That’s all this is.
gme
pls teach, i have no idea how this all makes sense
When the J&J vaccination data comes out, should I dump all my cruise stocks?
Look at it today...
What does this say
The road to 100 million begins
I miss TVIX
Big call buying last few days, too smh
What time does Joe Budden speak tonight?
Fuck my girlfriend, take me instead
I'm all in as well. Down a total of -50 %, still holding 100c. Likely INTC/TSM keeps climbing tomorrow, we will bleed like today and I am absolutely fucked
Do you know what’s IV?
Next week
I know this is heresy, but is anyone planning on buying GME puts when the decline inevitably occurs?
Hell yeah brother.
Hard to argue with that, honestly. But I already made back my principal and re-invested. Now it’s time to okay aggressive with House money.
not only that but...damn apparently I can get Tesla WAY cheaper soon then lol
Anyone else here read Charles Payne's book?
Anyone else hold GME through close? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Why would he
Ameritrade ?
Someone just bought 6.6 million shares of AAPL at 128.91 right at market close? What does that indicate?

Do you even know what you are talking about?
Absolutely
If you’ve got shares they will steady go up over course of 2021
today dumbass
You will know when the short sqeeze happens
this is a dumb question but how do they calculate days to cover? is it just average of expiry date (or weighted-average) on short options?
No Malarky Market baby
Buyden we need to build stuff for the economy. Let my X moon

They already did
Hope so, that's a lot of bags to hold

Can you tell us what dates to look at on the Tesla graph?
7.4 shares @ 9.01 30 min ago. I'm in!
Waiting to hear back on my 25k raise, title change, and bonus structure upgrade.

My wife is an event manager for a large convention hotel, property has been closed for 10 months
From what I understand he is trying be more "green" by rebuilding and modernizing infrastructure like roads and bridges.
A large sell order at some limit. Used to manipulate prices downward.
Lol, I'm certainly curious about it
You did good brother
I want to send Cathie wood a fruit basket and a love letter. Please let me know if you have the address. Thanks.
Bump. You called it my guy. Please follow up with your positions
The AH movement on GME is a spoof. 

Institutional investors are trying to paint the chart AH by selling what few shares they do have in an attempt to dictate sentiment tomorrow. 

Don't buy into this. MM's are getting absolutely fucked by retail on this one, and the only way they get out with their shirts is if we give them some breathing room. 

**Hold.**
lol bought the end of day dip. Hoping for the best
SPCE 🚀🚀🚀

***Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin aims to fly first passengers on its space tourism rocket as early as April, of note for Virgin Galactic (SPCE)***
Would be nice, been waiting on the moon ride for some time now
On god
Ending the day up 5.8%. better than yesterday i guess. Still under my ATH. No thanks to TSLA. Much thanks to ARKG, DISCA, GM and TLRY. 

I bought back into GOEV around close today, hopefully it recovers.
What do you think about some BB calls for 12 dollars by 1/22
TAN was $50 in September lol
BREAKING NEWS: BIDEN ANNOUNCES $50 GAMESTOP GIFT CARDS FOR ALL AMERICANS TO ENCOURAGE STAYING AT HOME.
So when do we hypothetically sell? tomorrow afternoon? Tuesday?

spce 1/15 35c

bb 1/15 10c

ford 1/15 10.5c / 11c
Now?
I used reddit's emojis, maybe they messed up?
I have like $2.5k total in GME

if it go tits up, I'll survive because I make more than that per paycheck and have plenty of boomer shit. it's fun to be on this ride though. worried about the people who borrow like 10k and cash out 401k to invest based on retards on wsb. this is prob why i won't be an overnight millionaire, but i'm also not gonna be living in a cardboard box because some mem stock tanked
OK Boomer
your welcome :)
2023 $15c holder here.. up 6k with plenty of head room 🚀 🚀
I think I would just withdraw 4% every year. I want to open a VN bank account so I can avoid the 30% tax, but I have looked into it and it seems like Finnish government can track when I buy & sell ETFs so they can tax it as Finnish-source income. You have been a big help! Thank you so much!
But let's be honest, would you have bought $5 shares then ignored them til now? I wouldn't have been patient enough.
5/5 is for sector funds like energy

The whole market could be mooning, but energy might still be down in a year. It's riskier
It's not going down tomorrow so you're fine lol
REVERSE GUH
I might be stupid but i see no money flowing to investors while the shares get diluted by new shares sold by management after they pumped stock prices.

What does Melvin's short position expiring with GME so high mean for GME's moon run as a whole?
All of big tech was down and they account for over 25% of the index
I didn’t check before posting. The more exposure it gets the better anyways.
My IV is only 150 on April calls where you seeing that?
That’s it guys - hold on 40!! GME
FDs are the way
APHA GANG🚀🚀🚀🚀
Can we add this to our own posts or do the mods have to do it?
Yessir holding. All hail WSB 💎💎💎
Hell yeah.  This is the dip.  It's gonna open at at least 10 tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀
More debt is the issue I believe
Most of us did in preparation for the short squeeze
My BB 1/15/22 $10c are looking good
Exciting. How far out? Cause...
I put this into google translate but it still came back as 'sell'
NVDA still drilling AH
As a newbie here looking to invest $2000 on a new stock every day (buy - sell); are the most active trending tickers something I should consider in searching for opportunities? 

I want to try to make +5% on 2.000$ each day (more or less at least). 

Thanks for the help!!
GME will single handedly bring back my account. Up 20k past week but still down 27k. We ride to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I was foolish and set a stop loss order, price dipped for a second, my shares sold and then immediately gme goes up again
Congrats!!
if OP is correct and this thing doubles repeatedly, aren't you making a ridiculous amount of money for little investment on like 1x 1/22 $55c? 

it's like $220 to profit thousands if it really does double each day.

FYI - I don't full understand options besides the general concepts and looking at the profit payout charts at certain prices.
Need Buyden to yell about banning fracking again, #ICLN
That’s gonna piss em off even more
I saw a cool $40 in upward movement by close today. These aren’t the 🚀🚀🚀🚀 I was promised by the autists
he totally should if he wants to join the 9-figures club.
lol
Welcome aboard retard.
MAC today 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I only have shares this time

I'm not selling until after a profitable quarter under Ryan Cohen as ceo

This is not the squeeze, this is the value play, the squeeze might start the real rocket tho
ICLN or QCLN? Which will benefit more from Buyden's big stimmy?
He closed the calls!  Added another $2-million in a day!
A true autist to notice that, respect
china workers dont get many hours to r3st
Shares available to short shrank even more going into close. What the fuck do these idiots think is going to happen?
S&P, DOW, and NASDAQ all closed red. How much worse you want it?
Even if you’re white you won’t get a warning
Fooking legend 🚀

Help me explain to my idiot friend how puts expiring tomorrow will drive up the price of GME, because he totally has a $39C 1/15 he's hoping to hit.
Remeber guys, we only 14 days into our 2021 365 days bull market :)
YOU HEARD THE GENERAL. TOMORROW TO VALHALLA
Im proud of you gme gang!!
damn that AH pump for SPY is real :S can't get my fill at lmt! keeps ticking up
These shorts really were doubling down to keep GME under 40 today. This is going to be glorious!
i slipped biden a $20 to tell everyone to buy ICLN shares dont worry guys
why
bet some of them are now shilling GME with the rest of us too
Solid entry point
It's going to go way to fuck up
I've gotten burned on covered calls too many times to sell any more of them
Damn gonna have to learn the greeks this weekend. Can't figure out how my call sat at $80up almost all day then closed at $160up..lol what? Being a newb blows.
They’ll profit at q4
I've never placed an option worth more than $70.

Today I dropped my stimmy on a couple of GME 45C 1/22. 

I'm so happy.
They’re not. Stonk go down before go up.
My positions in guns, weed and oil finally paid off
Yes
Who wants to watch Biden’s speech with me tonight! Just stay 6 ft away and wear and mask!! No food drink or breathing allowed either :/ 🌈🌈
I mean they are in different stages but you are right. Chewy has been growing for years now and gamestop is jusy being gamestop. However Ryan Cohen + 1/3 chewy board + all gamestop assets + moass = chewy in no time.
bullish close for SPY
>https://www.manganesexenergycorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Battery-Hill.pdf

You GME tards have no humor

Fuck off into your dungeon
Anybody know where to look at trade halts?
Nope.
Of course it will because clearly you fucking suck at this game and us CAKE BOYS don’t need to be riding with no suckers so sell ya shit 🤣

I’m probably gonna spend about $100 on BB $15 1/22 calls because they’re essentially lotto tickets that I don’t expect to hit at all but tomorrow morning I’m going in on them
earnings were a month ago, they were good, nothing happened

If I was rich, would I be here?
I wanted to put my EV gains into GME, but FCEL took a dump so I sold my SQ calls for a few GME calls. 

Now I am officially part of WSB against Melvin.

&#x200B;

Now pray Biden says something nice on EV/Clean Energy and I buy GME shares tomorrow.
I also have some funds in ETFs, but I also invest in Companies I believe in, like AMD or CRWD/JKS and NET. But My timing was almost always too late, and that is because im mostly Waiting for the Next paycheck to invest. The time Horizon..at least a few years. I guess in the end i’ll keep earning a few Hundred/thousands a year. I dont need to be a milionare, im ok with a few extra thousands Per year
It’s slowly shrinking
2/5 18.5 calls are printing.
The King doesn’t answer comments asked in these threads so I’ll answer in his stead: very obviously yes keep buying, we’re on a rocket to $100+.
Absolutely. There's no logical way that this inflated bubble can grow further. Keep your cash ready. There will be amazing discounts soon
This doesn’t look like a “dip”. It looks more like a sector rotation to beat down value stonks.
Poo was green..bullish af

Current CGM usually have needles that need to stay in for about a week and preventing you from doing any excessive movements of your arm. this device is tiny, probably can be done in clinic under local anesthesia. however, i agree, people dont even like to have their blood drawn so having an incision every 6 months may be a tough sell.
Still sitting on 1k shares and 50 call contracts.
Tomorrow it will be $50 no worries! 🚀🚀🚀
made my first trades today. Up 68.69% BB to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

All these retarded GME posts make me think this sub is slowly getting invaded by bots to pump their stocks
Exactly my saying !!!
Yeah I’m jacked to the tits with 19 2/19 contracts
Gamble couch money on short term otm GME puts to profit on minor pullback, take those gains and buy longer otm calls.

Holy great after hours wall of $40.

I have no idea how you didn’t double your money if you started investing in April or May.

I’m not sure what you bought and sold but put more of your money in well known major companies that will outlast and bull and bust. It won’t give you immediate fast pops you might be aiming for but long term you’ll be a lot better off.

If China never has a chance of surpassing the U.S., why is everyone crying about the need to contain China? 

Why is every politician, think tank member, and media guru calling China a “strategic competitor”, “revisionist power”, “rival”, “biggest threat to America” etc.?

Fact is that China has been the world’s largest economy since 2014 — measured by purchasing power. Take it from Fox News (2014 article):

https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-surpasses-u-s-to-become-largest-world-economy

In nominal GDP, China will surpass the U.S. by 2028 or before

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/26/china-set-to-surpass-us-as-worlds-biggest-economy-by-2028-says-report.html
Cmon man
I still can’t believe he fucking held 1000 of those calls this long despite how likely they were to expire worthless. The fucking balls that would take.

That's just for the shares and the April calls. Including the Jan $20 calls he sold today, he gained about $2.5m.
My SRAC shares are printing nicely.

Sold to cover up the initial put in and riding the rest into orbit

The prophesy will be fulfilled, we go to +$40 next week

I have a strange syndrome, I think there's scientific name for it. When tuning volume on TV I always go for digits that end with either 5 or 0, like 25 or 30 but never 27 as that is 'not round enough number'.

Same goes for stocks. When I please a buy order and I see stock might come down and now is $26.33 for example, I'll always submit an order for $26.00. That is some strange fuckery. Already missed couple of golden opportunities to buy ARKG last week for ~$94.
It closed at $50 in mine.

 Not a GME bro but I’m happy for my GME bros. Been long IWM for awhile and I just don’t see a reason to fix something that’s not broken. Maybe I’ll dump profits in GME eventually. Idk. I just love seeing you guys win.
holy fuck totally forgot... my life is meaningless
Think it only starts updating at like 8 am? and stocks only. I only have options so I don't know too much what it says about stocks.

Only thing red today for me was ICLN and feel great about it. BB, MT, ARKs x6, BOTZ, HACK, QQQJ, T. BB mooning again tomorrow. Papa Joe gonna pump that ICLN tonight.
Remember, we have to hit at least 55$ tmrw 🚀🚀
What price are you tards targeting by what time frame? I'm pretty fascinated by so many people not walking away after today.
When are we selling GME & BB boys???
I'm in 2/5 12c
Ok where was this at an hour ago man?!
Lol, op, just sell half of it or something. Its a meme stock.
Bbby one to watch rn also at 60% short
Looks like it isnt on DeGiro unfortunately. Thanks for the write up all the same!
I don’t know the answer which is why I’ve never made a purchase. 

I’ll stick to public market financial assets until I move or the real estate market changes.
it is just hype on the new ARK found that doesn't exist yet.
I love you man! Got in at $4.40!!!!
Spy calls at close were free right?
Gme gonnna dump 🤣
Jokes aside, how do we know the squeeze hasn’t started yet
Looks like it yeah still at 50k shares. Did not exercise
Do you know what you're talking about? I don't but I'm wondering if you don't either. From what I have seen, delta hedging is based on the delta of the option. So if a MM sells a call, they have taken a bearish position and they would short sell the stock, or sell offsetting puts. And vice versa. 

If they do buy or sell shares to hedge options, it's only up to the delta of that option. For example, they would only buy or sell 21 shares to hedge an option position that has a delta of .21, which makes sens because that option only moves 21 cents from a $1 move of the underlying.

Do you know which options are being sold and bought by MMs versus private buyers that aren't hedging? Or which are hedging by shorts or others with equity positions? I just don't know how you're extrapolating from limited info.
It’s a short squeeze, since there is so many institutions shorting the stock, institutions are inadvertently causing the stock to run higher since you have to purchase the stock in order to short it initially.

Since there was a catalyst of gaming consoles that initially shot the price of the stock high initially, shorts were forced to cover their positions. 

Then retards like us got our hands on it and pushed the stock price through the roof. Puts and calls are both pushing the price higher and higher
Yes
Can somebody explain what we are doing with Melvin i dont completly understand it
This is the way
Ah those big dreams. I'm even smaller scale, I'm up $100 from $400, but man those 6 figures are appealing.

Not until you buy 94 calls.
I've seen conflicting reports--$1400 or $2000?
All in GME shares sometime before the bell tomorrow
what call did you have
Based on your post, it sounds like you’re rather new with investing. I’m basing this largely off of the fear, lack of due diligence, and the question in general. Assuming that I am correct, does your line of “...it’s worked well so far...” apply mainly to stock decisions in roughly the past 9 months? If so, I would strongly urge you to recognize that the gains experienced post-covid dip are not typical. You could’ve bought stock in a company that sells cow manure and you’d likely be up. Ultimately, it’s great that you’re investing, but I strongly urge you to learn how to properly do your due diligence on a company to remove some of the emotional turmoil you experienced.
Seems like QCLN
I hate this phrase so much.

Does that mean your selling your GME???
It was strong at 38 to high 39, yesterday it was beat down to 32/33 then gapped at open to 37 then went on to over 40. 

You have a shot, it’s a long one but you have a shot.

Oh I made a big mistake at the end of the trading session; but I was lucky.  

Sometimes when the market is choppy I'll reverse my position by doubling the units bought or sold, so like with /ES I'll originally go long +5 and then if I feel it's finished its run and is about to turn back, I'll put in an order to sell -10.  This works when I'm right on top of things and I can make $$ on some of those big swings and just close my position if the price carries to far past my transition point.

Anyway, that works great when you're on top of your positional direction.  So I was -5 /ES at 3:48 and at 3:51 I thought the movement was going to turn, so I \*\*thought\*\* I bought +10 but I actually sold -10, which put me at -15 /ES contracts until I realized it by seeing my profit go up while the market was going down.  I nearly crapped my pants, by the time I put my buy +15 in I was freaking out that we could have a massive green candle slam in just before close which would wreck me, which kinda did happen, but I was already flat by that point.

Some lessons are best learned the easy way, like this one... whew.
Haha, me too man! All fuckin day.
Yes, both well established money printers which will just buy stock back in case the stock moves sideways
LETS GOO
There's literally no information here of any value and while that wouldn't normally stop me, it's already up big so you're late.
Good bot
I don’t know man... it seems to me that this is once of a lifetime we can get fucking rich before they pull da brakes.
Barely was able put my parents retirement into BB before close. They’ll thank me later
I don’t like David.
Just wanna bring this post by /u/DeepFuckingValue back in September 2019, where EVERYONE was memeing him.

I would but stocks only go up
I’m the same with volume numbers, but not stonks
Eod SPY calls, ahead of a 1.5t stimmy package is the easiest play ill ever make.
Where can i watch CNBC for free? You guys always talk about it. I want to get in on this toooooo
cause this is a clear pump and dump on a low volume stock
Bought GME at close for 39.90. How fucked am I?
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
God I fucking hope so
Goona get back in tomorrow.  I bought at the top last time.
Jobs provide cash flow. I know work is fucking shit, but that's gonna outpace or definitely supplement gains (unless you're already fucking rich)
If I made this much money every day I could retire in like 7 years
I told ya that $BB was gonna keep mooning
You don’t have to have 100 shares to sell. Look up poor man’s covered call. You basically buy a deep itm leaps and then you can sell otm calls that have a shorter expiration.

And yeah buying cheap options is absolute shit. It’s cheap but u almost are guaranteed to lose all the money you put in. If you’re in Robinhood check if you can get to level 3 which allows you to trade spreads
QUARRY
Should have listened to the guy the other day who said to buy BB
If anyone sold today they are barely functioning people.
I posted it an hour or two ago but it got flagged! You should still put in a trade if you still can! I expect it to go up a bit more after Biden announcement of new Stim. Checks
Why is BB going up
They are just trying to scare us AH. GMETARDS HOLD STRONG
Bought more today
Probably WSB 🚀🚀🚀
Are we like boomers? Our generation will price people out of stocks ? Everything is going to be a trillion if we keep it up.

Handful of SPY , reporting for duty.
He's a royal degenerate. 

I'm really happy for him though. Honestly deserves every single cent.

GME will bust 40 tomorrow just like it busted 36 today
I was also looking at this. Hate being a pussy damn
I hopes so...but why?
1400+600 = 2000

Having a pretty solid 2021 trading so far, adjusted my risk management and have been doing much better.
Wait Petcos ticker is actually WOOF? How adorable 🥰
My first day on this subreddit. I listened and bought today, but sold them shares when I panicked and saw no recovery. I failed my pussy test but I will listen to you dumbasses next time. Ty now I will cry.

Chill, few shares left to short
I believe you are what they describe in the medical community as: *autistic*.
MSFT you are dead to me.
Its in r/stocks so i assumed it was about the shares but i might be an idiot since if you are right and its not a sub for investing but for fanboy propaganda. Sorry for my mistake.
I just read Biden has never been to the West Coast lol
BB & GME don’t sleep
I have Puts on MAGA resale unfortunately.
I hope you make gains that would make Ronnie Coleman jealous. I don't have a competive advantage investing in that market, and I don't see it out pacing the indexes.
TLRY selling off AH noooooooo
That's enough advice for me - a doctor says it's a moon mission.

"Totally jailed everything into GME calls today"

Sounds sick
Any DD? I’m a autist college student looking to quit his job. Do we strap in and ride to the moon? 🚀🚀
It’s unreal how well timed the 1/15 calls were. There’s no way anyone would have believed this if he hadn’t been posting the position for months
No clue if he made any claims. I wasn't following his livestream. He's either going to sell those based on the reply from OP that it would be out of his cash on hand to purchase those shares (unless he had millions already stored in his bank) so it's much more beneficial for the cause for a run-up and sell then purchase shares if the supposed dip occurs.
I think you're underestimating the moving force of the sub. I get that it can seem impossible given how much Gamestop was talked about outside of the sub before the squeeze, but there's plenty of other examples where literally the only explanation is WSB money. Idk if you were around for Lumber Liquidators, but the only explanation for that pump was WSB. Finally, it really doesn't matter if the real movement comes from WSB money, or other people's money based on WSB as it achieves the same goal.
VALE has silently been mooning behind the scenes. Long dated calls have been going crazy
Fake account
fidelity
Life doesn't suck, give credit where it's due. You suck.
Got in today in case it becomes the next GME.
BB. That is all already up bigly boys 🚀💸💰🌙
Yeah that's absolutely true. But do you think a run up could continue? The banks are bullish on it, obviously they do what they can to try to pump it.
Only way to afford house is to win on calls. Great world.
Set a limit order and continue the moon mission GME🚀🚀
Patience, hold for a couple years boss
I need granddaddy buyden to take me to tendie town
If WSB is right, that's shits gonna hit 10$ before it'll hit 8$. free money if you have the patience to wait a week or 2. And as we all know on WSB, the first purchase is always free money
Did you see what it was like a week ago
What a day! Made a month’s salary ~$4,500 in small to mid caps tallying hard. I’ve been telling y’all they ain’t glamorous meme stocks that get all the attention but they make runs and I’m doing alright. Thankful 🙏🏽

It should’ve been Kanye speaking tonight but you guys decided to vote Trump or Biden smh
I waited a bit to establish a career before having kids.  I'm so sorry I did that.  Sometimes it's not as easy or quick as you expect to actually have kids.  Always it's easier to keep up with the high energy needed for raising kids when you are younger rather than older. 

We were able to buy ourselves better vacations and fancier toys, but those are so unimportant in the grand scheme of things.  I think we gave them a good childhood, but I wished I had been younger when doing it.  I think I would have enjoyed it even more and been better able to engage.

Today is the first day I’ve ever had losses. As soon as I sold it went up to $9.30.

Reminder that Melvin has 51000 GME puts expiring tomorrow, and their short-sell borrowing period probably ends tomorrow too.

The squeeze isn’t over. Tomorrow could very well be the biggest day. The major shorts are still holding their positions. Even more short positions were opened throughout the day. Tomorrow has the potential to be epic.
Melvins 24p expiring tomorrow are fucked, this is only the beginning.
fractional shares? or are those stupid i don't know im retarded
This will be at .06 by next month.
For our sake I hope you’re right
Tesla Energy = commodity low margin utility business

no what i mean is that a way a business survives is by its customers giving them business. the way you show a business you don't approve is by boycotting.
No way it's dropping 23% ah

I thought so too. But I think he actually clarified that he added some more money later on adding to about $100k
Fuck no. We ride gme to $150 and beyond
I don’t even have that many shares but if it hits $500 I will actually get GME tattood on myself

At least that is what I’m telling my $19k in calls lol
Any new DD on this?
GameStop isn’t a dying company but the yeah the posts are annoying.
This. I bought 200 shares at $2. Holding till moon landing
Yeah, you have to pay the Finnish tax regardless. It’s more of a pay now or pay later question. Personally, I would pay later and allow your portfolio to grow. Also, check what’s are the VN tax rates. The difference is what you should be looking at. I’m almost certain that the VN upper class are investing in internationally somehow. Good luck!

Sorry man not trying to talk you down, I just watched so many people run head first into it because someone posted a $4 PT.

Their Covid stuff is WAY off so you’ll be looking at the fibromyalgia drug short term. Their cash runway is less than a year so you’ll be looking for an exit opportunity soon before they dilute. 

Hopefully someone will want that drug and then it will raise it enough for you to leave with some profit. 

This is of course unless you are happy to leave it for later in the year when they might get a bump from approval for human Covid testing.
Yeah i had aprils and julys but i got into feb just cuz i am thinking we will see more big moves soon. Can always roll em out
Lol the arrogance of this statement
Only a true autist loses money on a stock that shot up more than 100% in 2 days. Welcome to the club baby
Stop spreading lies even if Citron is scummy shortsellers. https://redd.it/kqc22d They generated a gross return of 202% and net return of 155% in 2020.  almost 100% failure rate my ass.
He straight up didn’t have the cash to exercise them all at the time
You didn't bring up PE or diversification across multiple stocks as an argument to evaluate levels of risks. You used ATH as a measurement of risk. And that's simply wrong. Even gold the most stable haven is only 5% down from its ATH. Does that mean gold is risky?
want to have. 

If you see a stock you want to buy, and it has options, write the put option wherever you feel comfortable

Right now the bid on the $42 Jan 29 put for HRL is $0.15.

If you buy 100 shares right now, it'll cost you $4,397

if you write the put, two things can happen:

1) the underlying drops to where the put is ITM and your new entry price is the price you get assigned on the 100 shares, $4200, less the premium you wrote, $15. so your entry price is $4,185. had you just straight up bought 100 shares, you'd be down more than $200

2) it doesn't go down and you collect on the premium you wrote, $15

this works well for dividend stocks because they tend to be range-bound because of the very fact that they're dividend stocks
both.

why
I agree! Let’s do it again tomorrow!
Sold MT call for small loss to buy into SPCE weekly (dte) at 30. Shoulda sold twice at top but sold right before close of biz for good % and put it all back into 1/22 SPCE 31.5C right before close that I'm hoping cashes tomorrow or next week.
Stimulus is priced in, if Biden and the Dems don't exceed expectations expect a sell off. Bearish.

Y’all niggaz is fucked 🤣
ICLN, you have disappointed me this week, but give me a nice ripper next week and I'll forgive you.
Not everyone's, sure, but there's that huge block of over 53,000 24p that ARE expiring tomorrow.
Doesn't that mean this will be unreal of a squeeze? What am I missing here when basically all of the amount is shorted?
Sir, we can’t all be as retarded as you.

Looking for a online broker system which should have good all around workings. Thanks for sharing info
This is the way.  Diamond hand that shit until the bid goes to zero!
margin calls for dayzzz
I told myself id hold all my calls through tomorrow.. possibly through the weekend.  Shit is nerve wracking.  No idea how DFV has done it so far.  I need to learn how to emotionally separate myself from my trades and positions.
Very good write up! Thank you for the time and effort you put into this, will have to check it out.
Are you selling your calls for profit or simply exercising them to buy the shares at the strike price which is otm since the stock is way above strike ?
GME GOIN 50 TOMORROW
in 500 shares, slept on for years
open interest of what
so many mods on here and so many different opinions. They also flagged it after a few minutes, I doubt they discussed it amongst themselves beforehand, idk
Not really......

Ok. So I expect someone on the wrong side of a large set of options might want to do this to prevent the options from assignment?

Selling 100k stocks might be better than being assigned 5000 put options which would be 500k shares. Am I on the right track?

Does this imply that there is substantial organic upwards pressure?
It’s way up .... think I missed it... I’ll put a limit order and hope it takes
honestly i didn’t even read your post, but after reading this very nice reply you left me with, i went back to read it and it answered all my questions. thank u sir 🥰🦦
Better not see you complaining missing out on gains when it hits 50+ tomorrow.

The stocks don't always go up, contrary to what you've learned at reddit academy
Lol no one tell him
Sold 85% of GME of FDs expiring tomorrow . Hoping and praying rest 15% continues to moon 


Seriously what a divine stock this thing is
ICLN is an ETF and you can't pump and dump an ETF.
Hope we get an extra push tomorrow from stimmy and option expiration
my hands are sweaty, mom’s spaghetti 🍝 SPY $383 C 1/15

you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take
I think you should hold until Tuesday at the earliest, the long weekend hype should be huge!
I would assume whoever makes the calls averages the bets out like bookies, profit on both ends for them and a reward for the better if right, but when both sides added up it doesn’t total 1.
so do we buy GME or blue apron?
Lez be honest. They dumped this to buy calls on the cheap. How could we not pump on a larger stimulus. Market has wanted this for a long time
If anyone wants to talk GME private message me
Dramatic much?
Today I put my paycheck into GME, so I guess tomorrow I’ll take out a loan for more GME
I was going to sell at close but ran out of day trades. I am weak but have been shown mercy.

And it's a three parts thing WTF

Bitch I thought I can read but this is way too much I'm out
Gme 100 eow
What is a short squeeze eli5
I mean, you are. Just richer.
So if I sell a cash secured put & the price on the stock goes down & the put price goes up, Robinhood shows that Im losing money. I take it that doesn’t matter as long as the stock doesnt hit the strike, right? Are they just showing me the additional premium I missed out on getting?

Congrats again, your highness.
How much did you pay for the calls?
well it depends, if it squeezes properly it can go into the hundreds, it could also fizzle out into the 20s again. Depends on our luck. I think this is a good gamble overall.
Honestly, I hope GME skyrockets to $60 and I get called away and you make bank as well
Pretty positive this, JPM, and C are gonna print tomorrow
Was a wild ride and we will take Melvin with us.

What stopped you from just waiting and executing? Was selling the option worth more than the 100x(price-12)? I'd figure you'd want to wait to be sure where the peak was and execute on the downslide, as long as it's still above what you spent on the stocks.

I'm counting on end of lock up period, mid february. But I also thought GME mooning wouldn't be for another month so what the fuck do I know (still holding)
I mean the market isn’t *entirely* disembodied from the economy. How is there zero connection between the best economy in the world and the top 25% of the international market? It’s not by chance that these companies were born in the US. I’m not making a political argument, just pointing out that these things don’t happen in a vacuum. 

It’s not that the market has *nothing* to do with the economy. Saying it *isn’t* the economy doesn’t make obsolete any and all connection between the two.
I don't have the stomach to hold for 3 days while the world burns around us. Too much time for apocolyptic news to screw up my gains.
There’s something real distasteful about people calling for more price jumps, even after a huge run up of their stock. Seeing such blatant displays of greed make me question whether people are truly good at heart. If the direct cause of all of humanity’s suffering clearly resides inside all of us, do we even have hope for a better future?

Why yes, I did miss the GME run. Why do you ask?

That's why I sold my Ford call so early. I was expecting another GE 12/31 & it never actually reach $9.5. If only I held, I'd have made $60+ in 2 days. 😭

I would like to think all will hold and really send Melvin into a state of panic over the weekend.

But we all know it is going to be a massive sell off tomorrow.

The merger they did with Tilray isn't in our favor stock split wise. But they will be one of the largest weed companies after this merger. IMO you'll see a bit of a dip after the merger and then we should see steady growth.

Selling 1/15 55C was probably free money. Ended at 0.55 with -0.47 theta. Unless GME gaps up to around 50 at open, 55C will be dead by 9:31.

Anyone holding Apple Calls through earnings next week? Is this thing ever gonna get to $140?
I was expecting more of an epic day from GME.. figured we'd either see it crash or run even more than yesterday.

Somehow 27% up feels kinda like the worst of both worlds even though I am still in on some shares lol

Not sure, it's looking like a snack though. I'm hoping some of my GME gambles pay off more and I'm going all in on Jan 29 calls. There's no way it doesn't run hard next week.

The antitrust shit is overblown. It would end up at the Supreme Court before any of these companies get broken up.

Changes to how they use, store and allow us to access our data I'm sure is coming, but that isn't going to have some catastrophic effect on the price.

Stuff like, they post huge positive earnings. Or their CEO falls off a cliff. 

Some you can predict, others are black swans. You shouldn’t really buy anything if a positive catalyst isn’t somewhere nearby.
I thought I read somewhere that Brokers will let you execute and sell instantly? What is the process/option for that? I just opened a TD Ameritrade a little while ago. Wouldn't that be fine by them, especially if they could charge a fee/commission?

Shares of company a are sold short. Demand for those shares increases as people want to buy. Shorts have to deliver shares back to people they borrowed from which creates more demand which sellers use to increase prices

500 shares of GME at $19.00 and waiting for the 600% IV....AKA the rent maker.
#Stonk go up
lmao, glad you got out alright.
So fucking gassed about this shit. GME got me out of the hold in just like 2 days. But i have had like 5 or 6 green days in a row actively trading. Getting some confidence back about my technicals.
Goals for tonight-

Cohen buys another 20% of the company at market

Biden outlaws internal combustion engines, hydrogen, solar and wind power only by 2025, rebuilding every crumbling bridge in the US.

Spacman announces merge with Starlink.

Canoo partners with Apple for the iCar

Cathie Wood is commerce secretary

Our hands have been forged in fire and we shall see diamonds.
Two weeks before earnings is when the run-up starts. Buying calls on a Friday is scary but it's good timing to get AAPL

ICLN trying to pump AH but the rest of the market bringing it down wtf, leave my boi ICLN alone
I asked a friend who used to do HFT MM work on futures options, and he said he thinks most of these are hedged by a dealer. 

When they sell the initial option, they hedge at the delta. But they then hedge as the price changes (gamma hedging) which maintains delta \* shares exposed = hedge. As we near expiration, delta converges to 1 or 0 for most options unless very close to the money.
Everything into GME shares
😂😂😂😂
I have been day trading and it has been pretty profitable but I want to be able to put my money earned in my Roth IRA but it's not income. I don't have another source of income. What can I do?
I'm starting to hate nvidia
Good shit.
the ticker that you mentioned is not under $5 and was considered for removal
Yeah they are just showing you what the price of buying it back would be. So long as it doesn’t go below strike before or at expiry you’re good and will have the juicy premium for yourself.
I always seem to miss this stuff by setting a limit order and missing it by a penny or two. I set this for $1 after the quick dip below and it kept creeping so I said screw it and bought at $1.05 market price. Glad I paid that extra $50 for my 1000 shares haha
To be honest, no solid price target on this one. I may just end up holding onto this one for the long-term and periodically check in on it. Price targets show it's right around fair value right now, but I foresee a lot of growth for them in the coming year or two.

I read their 10K (https://ir.onestopsystems.com) and liked seeing how they've positioned themselves to support industries that are now needing to handle substantial data processing tasks. Page 6 of the 10K breaks down these industries and the makeup of their various business segments.

Worth backing Intel if your in for a long term  HOLD investment. Their chips are turning the corner and Pat is proven at VMware.

Absolutely do not listen to anyone saying he is not. Firstly there are thousands of companies still running traditional Data Centres with VMware having around 65% marketshare. A lot of companies who moved to the cloud are even moving back due to cost in the hyperclouds; AWS, GCP. VMWare is also making it easier for people who want to straddle traditional hosting and cloud by partnering with AWS and Google. The big thing here for committed revenue is its all moving to subscription model which is guaranteed Opex year on year.

Finally VMware for about 5 years could see that their massive market share in server hosting would be hit by cloud and thus invested in some of the best non Data Centre technologies, Velocloud which is a Network solution, Workspace 1 which is device management and Carbon Black which is the market leading security toolset. All of which lose zero market share to the cloud.

Pat identified all of this years ago. Hard to doubt he won't make a long term impact at Intel, but be willing to hold for 10 years and a nice little yearly dividends payout to help.
In the my industry (cyber), the average tenure of a Chief Information Security Officer is around 18 months. Obviously there are some differences between tech and engineering, but the old way of thinking about company loyalty is just about dead.

Hop away!

I bought GME at 21 a couple of weeks ago and then it dropped to 17. I also lost 1.8K on calls for TME that I paper handed. I've also had other losses on calls. I just started "investing" in December
Shut up stupid
All hail the bringer of sweet tendies
this is the way.. (to lose money)
https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today
Wow, I just told the old man to not invest in this stock at $20 because of the crappy business model. It also seemed like several others had the same experience with them. What’s causing the 17% spike today?
Shit...so I should've sold my 1/15 calls today?
Hypothetical situation:

Partner is about to get a federal job which means a federal pension.  You have already been working for the feds for a while and are handcuffed by the pension mostly due to the health bennys for life at MRA (57years old).  You will not be retiring before this age.  Its 17 years away.

You and your partner are now potentially going to get $90k/yr in pension+ss benefits at 62 (so there's a small gap from 57-62 but there's... other ways to cover that, also this is assuming 79% of stated SS benefit, not 100%).  You assume you need \~$75k/yr for your base retirement needs ("base" is still pretty comfy).

Do you contribute more than the minimum match to the TSP (401k) or put everything over 5% into taxable?  Or blow it?  Also your combined current retirement balances are going to be \~$1.9m in 17 years @ 5% contributions so that'll throw off another \~$75k at 57. 10% contributions = $86k, 15% contributions = $98k.  All at 57.

&#x200B;

What do?
This will continue?
Stairlink IPO would trick so many people here
Support looks good. Honestly, I think this is a fair price for it now in the 0.03s. Now we wait for more catalysts. I do think the pullback from the 0.05s was profit-taking.
what dips lmfao
Thanks

I don’t know, if you will be reading this, but I think it’s very impressive that you learned from your mistakes (it takes time and every individual learns at a different pace) and that you managed to win back your losses and to make a 100$!

I am new to investing myself and I am also investing most of my savings into ETFs or blue chip stocks, but a small amount, which I “can afford“ to lose, I am also investing in penny stocks or somewhat speculative stocks. 

If you have valuable lessons and tips regarding investing, I‘d be very interested in them :) 

No one is born a master, these things take time. It‘s better to learn these mistakes early and with relatively “small“ amounts (not saying that 1000$ is not much), but from what I saw here, people also have lost huge amounts and count yourself lucky that you do not belong to one of them.
How much u put in
No, they will never shut us down

People borrow shares and sell them, it’s called short selling. Their goal is to borrow them, sell them at a high price, then buy it back when the stock goes lower, to make a profit. Sell high, buy low. However, when a bunch of the companies shares or shorted, and the stock rapidly rises, it causes a chain reaction or short sellers buying back the stock at higher and higher prices
Anyone else scoop up some gains on WISH today? Fuckin monster. Closed out a 3 bagger that coulda been 7x if my hands were 💎

What happens if you only take out your initial investment and leave the profits invested (through fractional shares)? You wouldn’t have to pay taxes on that right?
That money is negative on your portfolio because either you buy the contract back for that loss, or the second you are assigned, the collateral turns into stock worth less, so that drop is priced in there.
Is this any good?

That is  possibly correct. Hard to know forsure. Markets are weird but that is a sound theory.  Ur om the right track.

Did you sell the 1/15 calls? I only held them until today because yesterday’s screenshot you hadn’t sold.

So how ripped are you after 100 push ups every loss?

Im outside looking in at the GME short squeeze. Can someone tell me what happens once it’s over? Does it then become a race to sell your calls before everyone else does?

I mean, what happens if ends at $100? No one actually wants GME at $100...right?
I swear thats why so many people love that stupid bitch. Low test men who secretly would love to get dominated by her. They can't, so instead they post everything she says on reddit and circle jerk it to infinity and beyond.

I'm in those 3 and BB and AMC lmao. Godspeed bro
Isn't it obvious?  By investing $10M in a stock yielding 0.57%, you'll get a cool $57k in dividends per year.

So.  Much.  Money.
That is in fact something that people do, using Cramer and other influencers as a pump 'n dump.
At the start of this year I wanted to see if I can 10x my account, so I started with $1k.

I got criticized heavily, but it is quite possible to do quickly. It’s a small amount so taking risk is expected and understandable. You can’t yolo your portfolio into otm calls if it’s a large $$$ of money. But with a thousand or two? No biggie.

I’ve been taking profits really quickly, but failed to do so on two trades, which have been the only two losing trades so far in that acc— AAPL and MGM. Both of which were green at some point.
Yup. I just caught up. Busy all day today and saw a tweet from walter which said $2000 and then another about $1400. Amtrak joe probably pissed alot of people off by being stingy there. Maybe reallocate local aid and send $2k given how people likely thought it was an extra $2k.
If this hits 50 tommorow i shall be happy.

I’m here to report that I finished the last three trading days within 5.00 of the day before. At least I’m not losing money. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Sounds like you should put them both on to hedge
Calls are bets that the stock will go up in the future and give you a right to buy 1000 at a certain price (or you can sell the contract)
I was expecting u/deepfuckingvalue to exercise those options... was this strictly a gain harvest or do you feel that the stock has lost its legs?

why not? That's still a strong valuation for a car company
Yeah oftentimes it will pop up on twitter that a CEO is going onto Cramer. Its the easiest fucking play ever and it happens all the time lol

Sorry bro, you might be collateral damage but there are coordinated pump efforts happening on multiple tickers here today. If you're in on it, we see you. If you're not, sorry bad timing.

The option gives him the right (but not the obligation) to buy 100 shares for $15 each. That means that if the share price is $15.01 the option contract is worth 1 dollar. At a share price of $16 the contract is worth 100 dollars. Basically, for every penny it’s over 15, he makes a dollar.If the share price is $15 or below, the contract is worth 0 because its cheaper to buy the shares on the market than to buy them for $15 dollars each. He then is out the money he paid for the contract.

All these amounts are based on the share price at the day of expiration. If it hits the $15-mark before that it is worth more because of the time left component
What is covered?
She would dick you down.
It’s been dead the whole day tf u mean
7:15 EST
Mods, right here.
sounds like you bought the peak last week. Lots of consolidation this week.
I'll buy when she's done dipping not while she's dipping
Hedge is in the name.
A business usually starts with shares being worth loads because there are so few of them. Once shares are diluted and there are more of them the value decreases. More shares issued means the business can raise more money to fund new growth. Too many issues however makes the business look weak and attracts less business. You have to walk a fine line to get it right. 

TLSS’ price is so low because they have billions of shares on sale. It means that at some point they will conduct a reverse split to reduce the number in circulation. This will hurt investors in the short term but lead to longer term gains.

Watch your words, youre betting against Google. We all know how much gaming has grown these last years and Google is currently leading cloud gaming. One major thing stopping people is the entry cost for gaming and cloud gaming completely solves that. Theyre not killing off Stadia for nothing, especially with Amazon also launching their own cloud gaming platform. This is a project they cant kill, this is a young field with billions to gain and basically only Google has the power to pull it off
Up 340% today
ok, but we know what are the plans for the future? at the moment it can be a great long-term play as well as a dead cat bounce
It's all play money. Just invest like a maniac.

Put it all on one penny stock or biotech stock or meme stock or 3x leveraged ETF and wait for your lottery ticket to print.
You are only retarded if you sell at a loss. It may dip to the high 20s. But it be at 50$ in 3 months
That’s ironic I also bought 10 $205 contracts expiring next Friday at close. What strike you get?
This guy fucks
Hope she bought gme calls
He had $1.12 mil in cash sitting there already, and likely had access to $8mil in margin, so I don’t know if would have been that ridiculous, especially with a $20 basis. Regardless, I’m glad he made good profit.
good call i'll check those out too
My data is sufficient, but my interpretation went wrong (it happens) on S&P. Normally, my algorithm is also 70%-80% success rate.

I am a rare visitor to wsb, do not have any idea about jam_croissant.
> Some other people were also predicting a drop but it didn't happen.
The truth is it is pretty difficult to predict future with 100% guarantee.
WE’RE NOT WORTHY 😩🍆💦
Who cares?
Fuck you
Haha, staring at this ticker all day is going to take years off your life! Go do the damn dishes!
"Fuck you" money is probably the most desirable part of FIRE for me, just being able to tell some dipshit off would be so clutch and I have to imagine your coworkers would look up to you as the guy who can say what everyone is thinking...
Yeah I haven't touched it haha. Only real solar play I have left. Sold the others.
Can barely find anyone interested in this stock smh
Why not use trading212?
Life savings?? :O
$$$$
What a fucking day, +17%
Cciv
In INDIA. Thats a house i lost.
Tomorrow. $50+. The next few months. $100+
I was just saying it to build fomo, but is Biden really going to talk about anything outside stimulus tonight? I thought tonight was stimulus only?
Well, markets closed, time to get some work done for the day. *Instantly opens Robinhood checking AH movement.*
nah
selling weed in college has its perks
Printed money on TLRY and GME today. TLRY is an going to🚀🌑 with Canada and probably the US going back into lockdown, plus the merger with Alpha looking is looking to be as strong as ever with the Alpha earning beat.
BlackBerry and GameStop warping all the way back to the 1990s. Any other antique companies we can buy calls on??? Sears? KB Toys, Woolworths???
but stocks are a zero sum game. if we common folks are all gettin rich, doesnt that seem..too good to be true?
Explain in monies please
anyone know why DASH is dipping?
Where do you find out about stocks that are going to be on Cramer?
Explain how.
BB 3/19 $10c, it’s not a phone company and is undervalued compared to other cyber security companies, $30 by March, to the moon!!!! 🚀🚀🚀
What's Biden doing tonight?
Tomorrow the billionaires buy hard
Holy fuck dude
im in thanks man
BB bitches 🚀🚀🚀🚀
What the fuck did you do you retard
All Biden has to say is: "We gonna be building a lot of shit and we be pumping that green energy asap".
ELIRetarded: What does it mean for the stock price? I keep seeing people saying it could reach at least $100????
Whoever pointed out yesterday the BB 1/15 8c for .04 I you.  28x bagger is awesome.  My only regret is only buying 5 .... I doubted the vibe.
I’m not selling a danm thing, it’s long and strong
Probably better, actually.
See you in tendie heaven, brother
Kinda weird that gamestop increase thought. It is dying, everyone is switching to digital
As the autist who made this post, I’m ashamed it autocorrected to artist
That's a constant temptation to yolo everything
They can't afford it
Yeah it would definitely not be worth it to buy more calls. Premiums are so high it'd have to skyrocket again to be at all worth it.
Bought a few ICLN 1/15 35cs for shits and gigs. 
Also GME to 75 tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀
60??? Wtf
If earnings doesn't do it $DIS next big buy catalyst will be positive park news.

Buy stock or long dated calls, don't YOLO, and add a little whenever a dip presents its self.
Okay thanks for the information!
Yeah I doing the same thing with 500, but realized I want to do some spreads so I'm enabling margin now
Either that or I am broke again. Riding to riches or bread lines! Help me Buyden!
***Melvin Capital has an Instagram account.***
I’ve been holding $280 calls (exp 3/19) after the investigation stuff started. Portfolio has been looking very nice. Reaching new milestones every day!
In college I was lucky if I had 50 bucks to buy a couple cookout trays and some natty light. Fuck you and congrats.
As long as the fed keeps printing money, the market won’t go down. The value of your winnings will but that’s different.
Not familiar with it, but if it is it's another option.
Imagine caring about trolling random strangers
I sold and bought bb calls
Sell CCIV, hood TSLA, BB, GME
Have you tried not buying FDs?
well, not yet anyhow :)
It’s been dead the whole day dude, still on the wave and hoping Biden can do something
Individual investors who recently piled into GameStop Corp. GME 27.10% are taking a victory lap this week after shares of the struggling company surged more than 90% in the last two days, putting the stock on pace for its best weekly performance on record.

For weeks, members of Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets forum have been touting GameStop, encouraging others to scoop up shares lof the videogame retailer and begin making bullish bets. Several posts on the forum had noted that short sellers’ bearish GameStop bets had been at elevated levels.

Short interest, which indicates the interest of investors betting a stock will fall in value, has hovered around 138% of the stock’s free float this year, FactSet data show. This makes it the second-most shorted company across the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc., NDAQ -0.25% according to Dow Jones Market Data. That had some Reddit users predicting that the stock might rapidly rise if short sellers suddenly had to cover their bets by buying back shares should the stock suddenly rise in value.

This week, that forecast finally appeared to take shape after news of changes to GameStop’s board sent shares climbing.

On Monday, the company said it had struck a deal to add Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen and two former executives to the GameStop board.

The announcement pushed shares up 13% on the day. On Wednesday, gains accelerated and GameStop catapulted 57% higher, its biggest share-price jump in history. GameStop gained an additional 23% in midafternoon trading Thursday.

On Reddit Thursday, WallStreetBets users were celebrating GameStop’s gains. Many posted screenshots of big wins from bullish options bets. Several talked about how they would spend their profits. One user posted that the experience demonstrates that the WallStreetBets forum “runs the market.”

Once just a small presence in the financial markets ecosystem, retail traders are increasingly influential. Retail-trading activity has exploded within the last year as individual investors, many of whom are stuck at home, have begun to try their hands at trading.


More than 10 million new brokerage accounts were opened in 2020, JMP Securities estimates. And on peak trading days last year, individual traders are estimated to have accounted for nearly 25% of trading activity, Citadel Securities estimates. Through social media and the ability to make free stock trades, individual investors have been able to turn companies into market sensations—GameStop being among the latest.

GameStop’s rapid share-price moves, analysts said, were spurred by news of Mr. Cohen’s addition to the board, as well as the company’s announcement Monday that online sales sharply increased during the holidays. Mr. Cohen’s investment firm has been building up a stake in GameStop and has urged the company to improve its online business. Mr. Cohen is known for the e-commerce savvy he displayed at Chewy, the pet-products online retailer.

That set the stage for the short squeeze, analysts and individual investors claimed.

“The shorts are freaking out,” said Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities. Meanwhile, “Robinhood message boards are bragging.”

One individual investor who was celebrating GameStop’s win Thursday was Jackson Call, a 24-year-old trader. He had been seeing WallStreetBets users encouraging others to buy shares of the company in recent weeks.

“I was thinking ‘GameStop? What in the world?’” said Mr. Call, a student in North Carolina. “I kept saying ‘No way am I going to buy into this thing.’”

But this week he saw CNBC’s Jim Cramer talking about GameStop. He decided to purchase roughly 80 shares of the company for slightly more than $20 apiece at the opening bell Wednesday, he said. That was right before the stock catapulted higher.

“I think it’ll just keep marching higher because there’s such a high short interest,” Mr. Call said. He picked up more shares of GameStop Thursday when the stock briefly pared its early morning highs.
If making 500% on your call at open tomorrow is fucking up, then you are so fucked my dude
Guys DFV has a couple milly in reserve. could he, in theory, dump it in all at once and force a violent short squeeze?
GANG SHIT 🚀🚀🚀
not in all EU countries unfortunately :(
He's injecting $1.9 trillion into GME I hear
Mostly speculation that Melvin is selling shorts. But reality is we just made them the bad guy for all short sellers. We don’t know who borrowed all the shares but we do know they are hurting.
Jfc my guy you are a legend. WHATS NEXT?! I’ll follow you till the ends of the earth.
People are going to be talking about getting BB under $12 for the next 6 months
Anyone else gambling their life savings in hopes of being able to buy a house?
I'm with you I'll hold till the end of the week and set a stop of .90, I mean it didn't sky rocket,  but I think if it's holding ok for today after a bunch of people sell off, then there could be a small opportunity.
!Remind me 73 days "ARKX"
Yup exactly
How does it feel making $2 million a day?
Bro you got fucking BENT
I wouldn't say flopped. The technology is definitely being used by tech saavy individuals and hobbyists.

The reason you don't see 3d printers in every home is because the average person is either too lazy or too stupid to learn the technology. More being lazy than stupid, I hope.

Point being, 3D printing has a small learning curve involving printer maintenance (electrical and mechanical), operation and modeling(software), and maybe chemical from different plastics requiring different parameters from the machine or even enclosures to regulate environmental temperature.

tl;dr.. the technology available is far too complex and finicky for the average person to want in their homes. More of a hobbyist thing.
Steel gang coming through... infrastructure in the speech
How bad does Cloudflare earnings have to be for it to go to 70 or even 60s? I currently have an odd amount of shares and need more to be able to sell more calls

BB as in BlackBerry? really??
Me too. I remember it like yesterday.
I’ve just started this. 

I used to do a lot of push ups when I was younger. 

Havent in 10 yr + 

In fact 10 was hard 2 weeks ago. 

I’m doing 20 at a time 2 sets each 


Over the last week I’ve done about 500 push-ups or so

Today 100 to cover $1 loss

30 so far on the 100 to cover my $2 loss 

Cant place another trade till I do the 70 more 

Honestly respecting this today I’m not taking positions 

Which is amazing cause I seem to have no fomo. I’m appalled this isn’t my normal!
Bb. Who’s with me?
BB IS NOT JUST A PHONE COMPANY. PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH THEY ARE LITERALLY EVERYWHERE IN CARS TOO. THEY ARE THE NEXT UP.
Thoughts on BB? I don’t get the hype.
I bought in at 39.5. how retarded am i
I just need 2% by next week.
a great trader follows this: trim and trail
Might go well might go bad. I intend to put a grand in it at first listing
You are a god
But but I'm recovering from surgery

I am Yeeting a Stack at some calls on XLE, ICLN, TAN  Im thinking Daddy Biden's infrastructure and Health Care spending is gonna print.
THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND! HE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY!
For GME, I bought $100k of shares that are up 126% and $95k in calls now worth $320k.  Overall, my individual trading account is now $9.4M still holding majority TSLA.  Including my 401k (which is mostly TSLA shares), I'm at $14.3M.  Bought $250k worth of TSLA 2/12 $895C.
You sir, are retarded
You think the stocks gonna fucking triple in a week
Bro watch his YouTube videos.  He’s Roaring Kitty on YouTube.  It’s worth it.

He explained in his Christmas update video post that this is absolutely life changing money for him.  He was not a millionaire before.  

Really humble dude and extremely cool.  I’ve watched a couple hours of his past few live streams, he’s the fucking man.  Just drinking beer, saying whatup to the other GME bulls, and discussing GameStop for literally 5 hours straight. It’s amazing!
I'll show if you show yours first
I’m so sorry you got fucked today
How do I unlock the green theme for Robinhood? mine is red.

Last minute spy fds seemed foolproof BUYDEN
+ the Lucid Spac confirmation
Why would you add that to your own post 😂
Oh mest they just accepted my deposit today. Time to ruin my gains
They're leading AI, for now...  next gen CDNA is going to be a game changer.
CEO has over a million shares.
What is the chances bidens deal makes Tesla go greeeeeen
💎🙏🏻✨
Which index is that?
Buyden's speech: Trillions of dollars spent on stimulus, which raises liquidity and cashflow in the markets, will weaken the dollar, will theoretically bring more overseas profit to the US for companies selling stuff, like AAPL, TSLA, etc. People will probably invest more in GLD, SLV, and B\*tcoin. Infrastructure will benefit.   
Looks like for now, we'll have to wait for the EV, ICLN boost--> should come up whenever the Energy secretary can be announced.   
TL;DR - stonks will go up lots in the next several months (if not tomorrow) even though stimulus news is "priced in".
It has less to do with greed, and more to do with dopamine and the fact that our brain likes numbers. I also don’t think greed makes sense in the market, because it’s not like you’re taking from others when you buy shares or calls and the price goes up, your investment is growing. When it goes down and you lose money, you didn’t lose money because you were greedy, you were just trying to achieve the maximum.
I predict $10k student loan forgiveness, and every 4 years they will dangle another $10k like carrot in front of a mule during a rainy season
Books? Next u/DFV here.
Tyvm for your contribution.
It’s up like 100% since Wednesday so I’m not sure. I was calling people retarded for buying in today, but those who got in on the dip made some nice tendies. There’s always a play, but many are saying the squeeze hasn’t happened yet.. looking at the 1 year chart of GME I’d beg to differ, but who the fuck knows lol
Just realized how true this statement was!
for once im glad I didn't inverse OP. good call my guy
I got in today on the dip, that means its gonna keep going down.
How did you miss the GME train this sub was (and is) GME for the last month
Yeah even under 12 is a steal
The MAN, the MYTH, THE FUCKING LEGEND 🚀🚀🚀🚀
hoping for big move around inauguration
What happened bby?
I’m super lucky to have an amazing dad who knows the stock market and told me to invest early. Had 50K set aside from him for college in my savings. I think I watched a YouTube video or two on Tesla and bought an even 750.
Jesus, 4 straight days ripping aint enough for you? How far OTM did you buy? Lol
The 75% is just on on position which could be a return of 5-10% on a position with the sizing $10-15k. So 75% gain would be about $750-1,000 nominal gain per play.
Hello yeah bro. They going to order one for me
Thank you
Seems like maybe the FB sell off is getting overdone? If I would have to guess I would say earnings will be strong since everyone is inside on their phones plus political ad spending in the last quarter. Any thoughts of feb calls to play on a potential earnings run up?
Just taking part is already super valuable beyond the shares. Just one example.

You read a linked news article, the news site tracks traffic, engagement etc for every article. If they notice a spike in any metric they will dig deeper and keep an eye out and if the trend continues word spreads and few months later you have a social buzz
To be serious for a sec, there really is something nice about the retail investor being able to win in a market set up for our failure so it warms my heart seeing the gain porn. 

On the other hand, buy shares GME is going higher.
Why do higher bond yields make tech go down ?
It's been free tendies for 3 weeks now.
Congrats!
Huawei partnership they bought 80 of BB patents. You will see BB tech in one of the biggest mobile companies on the eastern side of this world. More than half the worlds population occupies that sector.
He’s a lucky boyeeee
What’s the move with GME?
Look at his post history. This dudes been jerking off to gme for well over a year
Bro every time someone posts a stupid high PT I whip out the calculator and dream of retirement
I'm gonna disagree with you a little bit. On paper you're right, 30k is a small amount compared to a $1m portfolio. But, the paths getting those two things are very different. It's pretty easy to invest \~15% in a 401k over 25 years and end up with $1m in the stock market and still struggle to come up with a 30k EF, especially since nobody recommends taking 25 years to come up with an EF of that size. 

IOW, letting that 15% contribution coast along in a 401k for 25 years while your EF gets depleted due to "Life Events" and having to rebuild it several times over those same 25 years is pretty common I'd imagine.
$15M EOW 🚀🪐

Hey it’s me your Autistic son you sent upstate

Are you guys selling APHA today?
Google is the king of starting something that looks extremely promising, getting approximately 62% of the way there, and saying "fuck it, nevermind."
Black Berries Matter. For so long, people have treated BB like shit. Time to change. Let’s give BB the respect it needs from our great American men and women in blue 🇺🇸
I worked for one of their subsidiaries before. Assholes didn't bother to get me any clearances for my entire internship and then talked about nukes behind my back :(
Anyone else using Schwab?   


Is there anyway to turn off the ugly personal value metric at the top of the screen?

I just wanna see my daily investment returns front and center, not my deposit/withdrawal changes. 

I withdraw a couple grand, the shit turns red and makes me sad, even though my portoflio is really in the green.
✋🏽
I don’t remember tsla doing a 10 bagger in one day in March like your chart shows.
Why did you wait until it ran up 100% already. You have two days to get on the train already. We might not let you on now.
oh my fucking god BB up 5% AH.. do I finally win ??
Go on
He also probably bought the house for $30K, new.
TLRY up 220% in Zimbabwe
red first then who did he say second is?
I think I'll stick with shares for now until I do some more research!
Good point. You still gotta try to pick the best place to put your money somehow.
I love these. Thanks for posting!
Taxation is theft
What happen?
Ok
Lol. Not sure about this. It faded hard today after hitting the high.
I didn't mean the actual IPO listed price, I meant their price on opening day, which is 60% over the IPO price of 18.
I just want to buy my parents a house and help them 😔😔😔BUT I KEEP GOING TO 0
I got on the hype train and bought 800 shares of GME at average $41.50. I have basic idea of what GME does buy doesn't have any knowledge about their business plans and such. 

All other stocks I have are the company I believe in.

Should I hold on to GME for now or dump it tomorrow?
I'm just jealous of GME gang and all the instant millionaires. I've got LEAPS and July calls so it's just a waiting game.
Shares. The call  iv is fucking wild right now. Or I guess you could do weeklies for next week haha
IV is insane. If that drops anytime soon without major move in underlying you’re going to get fucked by Vega.
Ratio went from 19 to 31? I'm retarded but doesn't that mean short interest has been going up?
No need to shout
you’re gonna swim in tendies before your contract expires.
Its impossible to be too bearish on nkla.
I just gotta say, I fucking love you autists.
Can someone PLEASE call up CRM's customer service and complain about their stock's performance?
I work in a job like that, but it was hard to get, you just need to find a company that recognizes the talented people and puts them together
What happened to the Jan15th calls.. those could have printed too.. but don’t blame you for selling.. shit I would be flipping after the first 100%
The only thing that excites me now is 0 DTE OTM calls. :-|
Biden is gonna end his speech tonight with " Hold your GME shares pussy"
Not for long

It wasn't there as recently as a couple of months ago
Who else was waiting for this update?
Not really.  And I rarely even mention it here.
Buy 100 shares of BB at market open
Update from my [salary negotiation](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kto81r/daily_fi_discussion_thread_saturday_january_09/ginu98d/?context=3) with my current employer.

They weren't able to give me a new title but they increased the money from 7.9% to 12%. An extra $5,000 in my pocket.

Obviously not my "ask" but they met me in the middle. I'll take it.

74, but who’s counting? 🤣
AMD is literally selling every chip that gets made in seconds, going to be an easy beat.  Only thing limiting them is TSM supply issues.
Already 5% up in AH
Dude wait, long play
I have seen quite a few opinions based on the link you have provided. Can you confirm these companies will be listed on the Horizons ETF or is this strictly just an index of different psychedelic stocks?
Thanks!
You could open an account with a US broker, e.g. Tastyworks or Firstrade.
They don’t have the stock to begin with, so they need to borrow it. If very little stock is available, the fee gets higher and higher that they have to pay interest on.
Live from the GameStop shareholder meeting:

Fuck those old vultures. Greedy pieces of crap.
I regret not buying BB at close 😥 shoulda went with my gut
Pretty sure its supposed to be a Covid and Covid Relief (see limited stimulus) update. Not supposed to be a long term plan/infrastructure bill until after he takes office.
If you missed GME, nows your chance to make it up with BB
Where can one watch this?
But like... why? Stonks only go up
Thanks for the head up retard i’m up 58% on these boys today :*
Is everyone really buying BB calls when IV is at 150%??
GigaChads we looking stronk today!!!
Still in. He already posted. Sold his 1/15 20c today. Kept his 50k shares and April calls
Where can you find the up-to-date short interest ratio?
How did u decide on that stock ?
Why not tesla calls? 🤷‍♂️ you had millions
They do it to raise money and either pay off their debt or give them more resources to acquire extra business. 

Short term it leads to price drops but long term you get a better return because the business does better. Every company does this. If you believe in the company you just take it as a natural thing and maybe even buy the dips.
Can I fuk BB?
GME sells discs, Canoo sells magic.
It got FDA approval recently I think
u/DeepFuckingValue drop your next YOLO calls on BB 😂

Repoussé (French: [ʁəpuse] (listen)) or repoussage ([ʁəpusaʒ] (listen)) refer to a metalworking technique in which a malleable metal is shaped by hammering from the reverse side to create a design in low relief. Chasing, chased work, or embossing refer to a similar technique, in which the piece is hammered on the front side, sinking the metal.

Stop trying to play the market fam. If you want to be an above average investor you can do research on your investments. 

The WSB people only post the ultra highs and the ultra lows, not the oceans of mediocre performance that 99.9% of them get. It's called bets for a reason.

Yeah, I have a feeling that the GME squeeE is done. I don't know that SPY will be 385, in fact I think it'll open down tomorrow, but yeah. I could be wrong, though, as I very often am.
From what I can see I am pretty limited with a cheomebook. I am in the dark about things like brokers and platforms and how to use them in relation to MT4/MT5.

Could you help explain how/what I should be using?
Buyback plan until February. I’d say yeah.
I literally opened my trading account like 3 days ago and all this is new to me. I was told options are complicated so it kinda scared me away. I bought a 2/5 $11 call @$1.06 just to see what happens tomorrow. Hope this works out.

2/19 55. If it’s really supposed to squeeze that hard, you’ll make plenty of money. If it doesn’t move crazy, you’ll be fine.

Too bad they'll cash it in at the $50 peak tomorrow mid morning.
Omfg those BB calls.might print
The "days to cover" concept is a calculation based on average daily volume which is 12M shares.  In the past 2 days the volume is about 250M.  If they shorted 69M shares they could have easily unwound everything.  Since nobody knows for sure I'd highly recommend that you invest for value only and not anticipate more squeezes.  It's possible it squeezes again, it's also possible that was it.
You heard the man, roll those calls to February! Feb IV is cheap by comparison, so it's already in sale!
Honestly Walrus sorted me right out with ZOM BNGO and CLWD. Some of the best DD I've seen. Got some at 1.05, more at 1.12. Its gonna fly tomorrow, might wait til pullback and get more!

Holy that is crazy prices for a 1/15 option 😂

No need for foreplay in the future.  Just show your wife his post history, starting from the beginning.  She’ll be dripping wet by the time you get to this most recent post.
Yeah, this is a super helpful addition to the sub to hopefully try to limit the bag holders. Good looking out by the admins!
Just learning, wanted to lock in profits and weed stocks are very volatile, thought it could be a temporary bump rather than what it now appears to be, a stepping stone on the way to the moon. Obviously I am regretful now and feel like I've learned a valuable lesson, but hindsight is always 20/20 and profit is profit.

If you are bearing, just sell naked calls on GME like $5 OTM

Single biggest mistake of my short trading career. Had BB 3/19 8c's sold at 10:15. Made baby gains and screwed the pooch.

Long BBBY. The share buyback is a given.
I sold mine before right before close. 🤡🤡
Yeah I'd bank that 5gs and just hold. Honestly it would probably nice if whoever holds those calls exercised early on ya to free up your money for another investment.
👀
Yes. Now hurry up and sell
Praise be to GME.  May you land on the moon tomorrow.
Selling at $50 tomorrow
Sold today. Might get back in once the gme hype dies down

You’re taking me on a fancy dinner date with your gains at that point
I have high hopes for the Bidens speech. Also there is the newsletter from the CEO to the shareholders so thats some news too. We wait strong and see.

Ahh also🚀🚀🚀🚀
I hope so. Thinking about buying some more before it goes up too much. Just got my co worker to buy a 1000 shares too
Will buy GME at next dip
In at $20, still holding. 

Most likely will let it go tomorrow, we'll see.
So Tesla isn’t a safe haven for cash interesting
Oil companies are loaded to the teeth with debt which they acquired during the glory days - when all people could envision was ever-increasing demand and ever-dwindling supply, leading to rocketing prices. Now it seems that will never happen. We have more supply that we thought, and we may have seen peak demand. Their long term plans haven't worked
What’s the deal with RIOT?
yeah same. THey need an option to turn that shit off or change it to investment returns cause it's really not cool for a trader/investor. No one wants to see that shit.
Interesting. So it could be a long short squeeze
Right? Make them beg for it back. Block their number. Turn off the lights.

Biden sending you tendies tonight don't worry
Hi, thanks for the info!

I'll look into PYPL and SQ, don't know much about fintech but I'll do some research into that as I'm sure it has a lot of potential. Which fin-tech co would you think is the most "open minded" to blockchain/cryptocurrency? Although I don't want to invest directly in blockchain or cryptocurrencies I wouldn't mind some small exposure to it.

I'd rather avoid a specific genomics exposure, as I have it through REGN and CTVA and of course the index funds. As a value investor I'm not too interested in the very high valuations of a lot of genomics companies in ARKG (and the volatility), I think a lot of genomics work will end up be being done by the larger biotech companies such as REGN and others such as Gilead etc. which have more favorable valuations in my opinion. 

Thank you!
This was the same thought I had earlier today...
Thanks for the re assurance step bro.
Ye i know, but him selling it today translates to him not wanting to risk it tomorrow, meaning tomorrow might rip my asshole apart
Same so either way we're fucking together
GME GANG 🤝 BB GANG

UNITE
Implied volatiliy. Stock is volatile so options get more pricey. 

If you're selling options, you're going to want a lot more if the stock is likely to move, so they're a lot more expensive to buy.

In case that wasn't sarcastic.

That's the worst thing on the internet? 

Do you, or any of the other bitcoin shills, actually have some hard data to share? Like a  graph of bitcoin holdings by institutional investors as a percentage of total bitcoins in circulation?  I'm very eager to see how this percentage is changing. People saying 'oh this time around, it's different. Institutions are piling in' need to be able to actually show this data instead of pointing to Grayscale as the beginning and end of their arguments.

Yup. I teach sailing already and plan to eventually get my captain’s license and continue teaching what I’m certified to teach, maybe in different locations (Hawaii, Caribbean, etc.). I’ve considered doing the “captain for hire” thing but think that’s a bit more stress than teaching a class (even though one is literally a week on a boat), so TBD on that option. I also plan on volunteering and going to the gym, both a few days a week when I’m in my home location.

Just setup a calendar spread on AMD. Sold 100 1/22, bought 100 3/19. 89-90 has been pretty solid support I think it will bounce.
AMD is the biggest cock tease piece of shit stock on the planet.

I’ve got 200 shares I’ve been selling covered calls on since mid December. I want to get assigned but it just won’t hit 100 to save it’s life. 

I don’t mind holding for awhile, but jeez dude it’s got to be crushing dreams. It goes up then drags my account down like it’s got albatross around it’s neck lol
Yeah a increase in the supply of money and a increase in circulation will increase the price of goods and services, so yeah oil wil fo up to atleast  €60/barrel by June 2021 hell I hope and pray we see $85/barrel by 2022-2023

This is the beauty of having great gains with gme the past few months. It drops ten percent tomo which I don’t think it will. Retards will buy the dip - losing 10-15 percent on a stock if you have conviction in and having a great time doing it who cares.

Niall Ferguson has a commonsensical view, so CNBC decided to cut him off. Lol
Do you really need to ask when WSB is buying GME at 300% IV?
Uhm. So, that would be yesterdays numbers I presume since it says a price of $31. Also what does average daily trades, calculated over i don't know how many days, matter when yesterday and today had over 200M. It's over.
Just based on fundamentals GME is undervalued. Trading at about a P/S of 0.5, if we assume GME can be priced as a growth stock like SQ, which has a PS of 15, then GME shares could be worth almost $1200 on growth potential alone, forget a MOASS.


TL;DR: GME cheap, buy shares. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Senseonics Holdings shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Senseonics Holdings is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Medical Info Systems industry that ranks in the Bottom  6% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter

Definitely trendies coming our way
I’m okay with $PLTR being a little lazy lately and looking like a clearance rack at Target. I’m scooping more of it up right now before it’s too late.
thats how you're supposed to look at it. that's how it works. people need to know this. you are not buying a company so you can sell it to another idiot at a higher price. you are purchasing because now or sometime in the future the company will be producing so much cash flow and giving that back as dividends and the dividend yield will be so high if people don't bid up the price. who cares if the another idiot doesnt want to buy your company for a higher price. just sit the dividends and collect 50% yield. crazy. this is how it works. this is what people need to know. thats why companies that never pay dividends are ponzi schemes. no buyback, no anything, they NEED to pay dividends. at some point in their life. otherwise ponzi scheme.
YESSSS BEST BOT
I shan't yet
stfu lmao
It wasnt. Thanks!
Took my profits eod for GME and put it all back into ICLN and ARK. I can only handle these crazy trades every so often and I have shit to do tomorrow besides watch a ticker all day again hahaha. my steel shares look great too  🦾🦾
No kidding, I took a look at putting in a straddle and premiums are out the roof.

I sold puts for may $16 & November $17

Carrying 100 shares with a sold 26.5c

I expect it to trade pretty neutral for the next few months tbh. DBX had the same trend at IPO (granted they had way less hype).  I’m expecting us to land around 15/share. I’ll just sell premium to that price and then hold.
Hang on this is a paper trade? Why is OP giving us fake loss porn??!

LOL
I did some more research, and think you might be onto something! I put in a big investment today.
Suck it dawg!
5% each in DAB, TAGS, JJG, XME, and PDBC has proven an excellent play for me. Works as a great hedge if you buy the premise that [commodities roughly correlate inversely to stocks](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-13/kondratieff-wave-in-commodities-is-bad-news-for-stocks)

You know there's something about you little fucks I like.
Not one goddamn person in wsb knows more than 5% of what's really going on. An armada of anonymous monkeys throwing loose change at a roulette wheel like maniacs. I love it here so much. 

I read words like kramer Jack Ma I don't know who the fuck these people are. Some days I open tos, and I just let my cat walk across the keyboard and see what happens. I ONLY KNOW wsb.

So I should FOMO into BB shares rn huh
I'm not asking how to *predict* a flat market or *predict* when that market is going to wake back up. I'm asking the best way to tell in real-time when it's gone flat. It's been [like this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/735561381851431028/799354487419830302/unknown.png) for 4 days. It would seem like there should be a method to determine a shallow-range algorithmically.

God what a pussy site lol. Thanks for the info though
You will hate yourself after you sell
Spy $400c 2/19 will print
I’m no Expert, but I believe it’s based on 3 things;

1. Time Value: the Further out the expiration date, the more expensive the ask price. Similar to purchasing insurance, it costs more the longer you have it.

2. Underlying Stock Price: This one’s simple! If the stock costs more, ask price is higher.

3. Volatility: The more the stock price fluctuates, the riskier it is to invest in, a more volatile stock comes with more risk, hence a higher premium is expected.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but this is how I understood it when it was explained to me.

ICLN is still down around 30% since its inception in 2008. I wonder whether some people that bought into then have held it all this time.
I was going to make jokes but I wont very cool.
Going to be watching BB all day. Its ripped it in the AH up almost 5% after being up 22% in the day.

&#x200B;

I just need it to keep on moving!

And watching Apha and Tlry to see opportunities before the 20th.
Nobody talks about APXT anymore. I’m still making tendies in there
I would be happy with $3 but analysts are saying it could go to $7. 

There is DD on this elsewhere in the sub.

My portfolio is up $94k (58.5%) in the last two days. Mostly from GME, but almost all my positions are doing really well. Feeling especially happy that I broke a quarter million today.
Why would that be announced today? Holding 50 shares @ 16 so ofc I’d be hyped just haven’t heard that rumor
what do we have for nio?
well, like I've said. They were under investigation for unethical competition by the US Anti trust committee so that's not capitalism that illegal. There are rules in place for doing business and for lawful competition and those are in place to protect consumers. 

So while you're right about a business being at it's basics about getting the customer to use their services, how they go about doing this is mandated by rules. And that's what I'm pointing out.

here is an article that talks about it : https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/amazon-bullies-partners-and-vendors-says-antitrust-subcommittee.html

And if they push so hard as to have the us gouvernement get involved in their business model you can bet your ass it's going to impact the stock price. That why I say I prefer ethical companies with morally sound CEO's that aren't constantly being investigated.

That's where the greeks come into play, my man. The delta of an option determines how much the price of the contract fluctuates as the underlying stock value moves.

if you sold afterhours youd be up 5%. Ask yourself
Marijuana does appeal to the demographic there
It’s just a matter of priorities. I have fire goals but I wasn’t willing to delay starting a family to achieve them. I had my first kid young which definitely increased expenses. If I had waited an extra 5 years I could have built up a huge nest egg and coastFIRED. Some people on this sub prefer that route. 

If you can afford a family and want it now then don’t let early retirement stop you.
Probably tomorrow
100%. We will be at $50 soon. Though not sure when you should click sell.
i dont know, but i need another 30% rise until im green again

If I were you, would just wait and keep watching it and jump on the dip around 1.20 ish, just saying I loaded some and waiting to get more shares.
market conditions are not the only reason to withhold an announcement. remember that the talks could be souring and eroding. in fact, at this point, the probability for that is increasing...

idk why it keeps getting flagged
> Okay tell me what you would invest in then.

I don't give specific investment advice, unless someone is willing to pay me at least a million dollars/year to do so, which would probably make them much more, depending on AUM; I am *very* good at it. 

Invest in what you understand. If you understand nothing, invest in world indexes. Without superior knowledge of the world you can't consistently beat the market.

> Why is there so much sentiment on ICLN then?

Because most people are stupid. Monkey see, monkey do. Momentum trading works, until it doesn't. People are terrified to do something nobody else is doing. I take positions *before* the masses want it.

> So much is already priced in, but renewable energy is guaranteed in the far future so I believe this is practically a guaranteed long term play

The "renewable energy" provided by companies today and the "renewable energy" the future needs are not be the same. If you look deep enough, you will often find that there is nothing sustainable about those technologies or companies. People invest in the story, but if you look for the details, it all falls apart.
More important that silly hypotheticals on what someone may own: You only lost 1/3 of your asset if you sold it.  If you held it.... well, you probably know the answer.

&#x200B;

But for OP's query, rating risk is a comparative metric. VOO risk is high compared to less risky asset classes, say investment-grade corporate bonds. That five point risk scale covers the whole spectrum of investment risk.

The GME wheelbarrel just brought in a whole new truckload of first time retard investors I can tell. Welcome
It's beaten the S&P 500 over that time frame.
Bought calls today for 2/5 94c. Hoping for a bounce next week and a earnings run-up. I think it will float around be pinned around 96 at earnings.
It's like a Roth sandwich!
Hmm
Any reason not to consider a Roth TSP as well? If you were going to forgo the immediate tax benefits by considering a taxable brokerage, it seems like more Roth dollars would be a good option.

Alright. Well I just gotta wait to see if there's a dip tomorrow with all the calls expiring hah
Biden is only going to focus on the stimmy and jobs tonight I feel, not on his agenda. That should be a speech for his inauguration.
Combo of price action, fluctuations in IV and theta burn.
A week from now you’re going to be laughing to the bank while that guy will be commenting on another post about how retarded someone else is for going in after it’s gone up 250% the past week.

Holy shit. I come here to laugh but you guys are slowly making believe.
I think that’s the premium he paid.
So how’s this work exactly?

You’re betting that by February 19th the stock will reach $14. And if you’re right you have the right but not the obligation to sell your shares or something?
The coldest, hardest 💎🖐 we've seen in a long time. Absolute legend.
Thats just how it goes with the options game. The OXY calls i sold in late November for 2 grand closed worth 50k today. Oh well, on to the next play. At least I didn’t take a loss.
Ok, an almost 100% failure rate on their shorts.  Their gain is because of their long positions like Jumia.  It has been pretty uncanny how shitty they’ve done on their shorts, while obvious shorts like NKLA passed them by.
So then that slight dip may be a signal to throw a good couple hundred at? 

I also purchased 50 shares of OGI and thats slightly up. My brokerage hasn't cleared my deposit (its been 4 friggen days..) else I'd have 30 of Cresco as well. Interested to see where fuel, accomodations, and cannabis will go post-COVID.. though I'm reading and learning about everything.

Thanks, bud!
I have 2022 calls so it’s my chill stock I’ll let it do it’s thing when it wants to. Would recommend
If you are thinking this is the squeeze then the jan 29 calls are far enough put to let this thing ride. 

If you believe no squeeze and want to buy much safer calls, look at April 16th and this will give you time after earnings (which is expected to be better than recent years)

Thanks for the post! Saw this last night and bought 3500 shares at open, sold 2500 to break even and am excited to see what this stock can do (:
I’m looking to buy for the first time too! Any advice on where to get started and why all this talk around this GME stock?
I sold so 11+
AH ends at 8 right? I am usually up that late watching the markets and futures anyways haha

I ended up buying 350 shares because I'm easily influenced. To the fucking moon!
I really don't understand how NET constantly sells off  as it's approaching ATHs.

Do people think the demand for CDNs and security isn't gonna skyrocket over the next couple years?
Yes
Anybody think Biden speech could push Vale up tomorrow?
Your asking the wrong guy, honestly. Just enjoying my internet points because my gains aren’t enough to be justified as gain porn. So I make my small comment and get my upvotes for the day. I don’t have the balls to yolo my life’s savings into a call, even though it’s very tempting.
thanks for the confirmation bias
i identify as retarded not degenerate they should change that
Puts on anchovies
don't you think those are just retail investors like us buying them for fomo
Maxing out the TSP (forget about roth for a second) gives us \~$200k/yr in retirement, on an assumed $75k/yr spend.  Is that really necessary? To lock that money up like you're locked into the pension?  I could see maybe Roth first then maxing TSP after.... maybe.  But even then I'm leaning towards Roth first and then taxable after.

Idk why panic about GME, it’s holding the 2:59 closing price. It was short pumped due to FOMO and then MM sold some off for paper hands.
Why the fuck didn’t I jump into uso today fuck my life 🌝 after the speech

Thank you for taking the time out to do a DD 👍, looks great

never in a million years would that pass underwriting.
Diamond balls
Agreed. I figured this means plenty of cash to exercise on the April ones if needed.
I bet he is gonna hold these Apr 16 calls until Apr 15
You will be fine with shares
It's people taking AH gains or MMs pushing it downwards. It isn't dropping fast enough to be significant if you look at the volume, likely MMs trying to take the edge off for tomorrow, or try to suppress momentum.
BB AH so good
There’s exceptions but that doesn’t change the rule!
🙏🙏🙏
You guys best be real careful holding options overnight, they are likely to be exercised even if otm, methinks there will be some insane loss pron from this going from lambos to Tonka trucks.
This is the way
Go away MM

Ew gross anything under 10% return right now are you retarded and enjoy watching money deflate faster than your pittance of a APY? Lulllzzz
What’s your expiry? ‘Cause they’re not getting back to $230 anytime soon...
That why you buy 6 months out. It could dumb 40 percent and still recover. Especially with Biden. They will take real steps to legalize weed federally. Even the rumor of that is worth it’s weight in gold
I've made enough money. Going to cash out tomorrow
8923 weeks to go
Not exactly but yes.  My understanding is (I'm an amateur)

An index fund follows a set guideline of stocks that meet that index rules.  There are s&p500 index mutual funds and ETFs, clean energy mutual funds and ETFs, etc.  These only buy certain stocks in certain percentages of weight (only own 20% of 1 stock because that stock makes up 20% of that index.)

However, ETFs don't have to follow an index.  In fact sometimes two different ETFs in the same sector, one can be an index following and one is a trend following. 

Like BUG and CIBR.  Both are cyber security ETFs.  BUG follows Indxx cybersecurity index, CIBR just invests in what it considers is cyber security related on it's own judgement.
since 2017 iirc, could be wrong on that
Long LEAPs is the only play.
I know someone who bought WDI for over 100$/share and lost 300k $ when it went down to 0.5$/share. Last week it went from 0.5$ to 1$/share. Imagine him saying: instead of losing 99.9% i look at as if i made 100% profit from 0.5 to 1% while s&p500 made only 8%.

My dude. Just invest into a very broad ETF and you will be a millionair when you retire.
God.
I shorted apha today eod 😬
I read your dd & I am a little confused. If you don't mind, could you explain   


a) what will happen if people were to sell their shares at open tomorrow  
b) if everyone sold their contracts instead of exercising it  
c) If they did not exercise it & held it to expiration  


Which of these scenarios would drive the down & why
BB is just taking off
I suggested a friend to go in on a few shares a couple of days ago and now she is saying she won't take my advice anymore lol
Maybe its investor sentiment. I don’t know. Some may see it as investing in the demise of civilization....Extreme? maybe yeah. I sold all my etf (SPY, VTI) because I don’t want to indirectly invest in companies I morally/ethically object to. Remember that scene from big short where the young dudes made a fortune with options on controversial companies like Phillip Morris or smith n Wesson. Same thing today with vaccines I’m sure.
You missed the train man, it's probably too late. There still might be some upside, but with IV as high as it is, you're going to have a hard time making money buying options to open.
All I see is green!!!!! GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚
Will the night shift carry their weight tonight boys?
I think 80% WSB was so heads down on GME today that we probably wouldn’t have realized even if fucking Apple stock tripled

Tesla is valued at 1500 P/E.

Gamestop is currently under 0.50 P/E and they're on an extremely obvious pivot path to e-commerce.

Not saying every company will be Tesla by any means, but 0.50 is a stupidly low valuation with how high the multiples are getting nowadays. Once it's more clear to your average investor is when it will be valued correctly.

TSLA doing a Cup and Handle now, it is getting ready to break out
Yeah I figured the sector itself is up 10% on the rumor and hard to buy the rumor and hold for the news when you're looking at triple digit gains. I thought about sizing down (buying my short 45cs) but the combined more likely scenario is either a rip above or a retrace below. Both of those hurt on my setup (41/45/46) and I'm not confident that we'll actually rip above to where buying 1DTE 45cs *now* makes sense. 

Hope it works out for ya!
He’s doing that tomorrow.
I sold those contracts, the 3.69 and .36 is the decrease in value from the price I sold it at. I think delta and theta influenced this drastic drop in price in literally a couple hours.

Stop the sell!
So, options trading isn't buying shares, it's buying contracts stipulating the stock will go up or down.  Literal gambling unless you know something others do not.

Currently, large funds have *huge* positions betting the stock will go down.  They are short the stock (puts).

The Reddit hive mind sees the volume of shorts is so large that if they force the stock up, the big funds will be forced to buy shares at a higher market price and sell at a loss to those that have call options.

When the short sellers are forced out of their contracts due to time (the expiry on the contract) their options will expire in the negative and everyone with call options get a share of that value the shorts are losing.  At the same time, the massive demand for shares as a result of shorts buying stocks forces the value of the stock up.  This is the "short squeeze".

We are waiting for those who bet the stock will go down to lose their money so the stock goes up due to high purchasing demand.  Currently I think most of the uptick is due to a significant amount of investment from investors that are long term on the stock.  Those who bought the stock early when market sentiment was negative experienced a 100%+ gain.  This has only put MORE pressure on the short sellers and they are bleeding cash like crazy, increasing the probability of a "short squeeze".

That's how I understand it.  I may have some aspects wrong.  But that's the general idea.
I agree on all your points. Can't believe I forgot to mention the Saudis/OPEC.

Who knows but 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 everything here. If you are learning, take a course on options before diving in and hitting full retard day 1.
Congrats on the gains - it has been a great year for a lot of people, but only for the people who could see market crisis as market opportunity. 

Break even is *slightly* higher when you include transaction fees, but this seems like a worthwhile play if you are bullish on the stock. I really like the article about IV on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp), almost everything I learned I learned there or in conversations like this one. 

ET is an interesting play and I don't know a damn thing about them except that they're in natural gas. A lot of people aren't loving the oil and gas stocks, especially under a Biden administration and a democratic congress; I'm used to the clean energy meme stock echo chamber at WSB - curious if you could tell me a little about why you're bullish on ET?

Maybe I'm exaggerating but I genuinely believe you have done more for this company than the vast majority of activist investors ever could.

Without your iron balls, I doubt even a quarter of the people on here would have got onboard this rocket ship and GME's share price would have stagnated making it so much more difficult for them to raise capital etc.
think you should see how the action develops tomorrow in pre-market
I bought one close to close for $2... I thought that was a bit risky, but it was up like $1 before close. 🚀$50 tomorrow
I will definitely check it out.

Thanks for the response!
theres your first mistake.. "if you're smart" . i dont think beyond reading wsb daily thread dd's

That's also why people get IV crushed btw. Which pretty much always happens after earnings because the catalyst is gone, so unless the stock immediately moons, the options lose most of their value because the IV drops massively.

Might save you a mistake half the retards here seem to make.

ill do you one better. i bought AUPH thinking i was buying APHA and now im stuck in a lotto ticket biotech fda play with $15k.
Welp day. Thought as the market was starting to slow down in any real kind of movement in the morning, that it'd be your sturdiest day of the week but then big tech (although it was mostly Google/Amazon that tried) plus Tesla all reversed after trying to go up in the morning. 

Probably the weakest week in a while this week, although still nothing compared to what we have seen before. Although small caps are still having fun!

I’m expecting at least $50 by ER, and if not then after. I personally hope some hype builds up before so that I can sell the 2/19’s at good profit before they get IV crushed. Also, I’m praying LOGI earnings on Tuesday bang and we get some hype off that going into our own ER

I haven't looked into it but will the Roth TSP lock your money up like traditional TSP? Or can you access that earlier if need be (contributions, not gains)?
Product vs Program manager is a company by company distinction and largely fall under the catchall "PM" term. At Microsoft I believe the PMs were Program manager and it is a broad term, Google breaks them up into 2-3 different roles, I don't know Amazon's structure but it is different as well if I recall correctly.

If your GF is a Project Manager switching to Program or Product Manager will likely open more opportunities and chances for pay increases down the road and make it easier to swap companies. I would _typically_ expect a project manager to mainly manage timelines and some resources where a program/product manager is doing a mix of technical decisions and planning, customer/user advocacy, etc: basically the interface between engineering and "the real world".

As for that pay outside of big tech: you are going to have a hard time matching big tech/unicorn stable compensation for mid-career level anywhere else. If you hit a degree of specialized senior/staff/principal then you may be able to command a high salary in your specialty at smaller shops or advanced stage startups.
I've gone through the same phase and have had really good luck the past year and a half or so buying winners but most importantly letting them run. Limit your downside with stops and let your winners go it'll pay off.

It should open up barring some right wing nutjob trying to do something anti-American tonight.

The gme thing has me laughing.  I hope most people took their gains today, it just makes zero sense that the squeeze will continue this long with the insane volume traded today.  I think a lot of long term options were opened and someone made a mint selling their shares at double what they paid for them.
Why

Good day :)

Still have a long bias overall, but Asia looked so overbought, I couldn't help myself. Still in that trade and basically free-rolling now, risk has been taken off the table.

Would like to see ES below the monthly VWAP and closer to the 2021 start price again. We aren't even that far, so it's not as if I'm a greedy mini-bear.

Long story short, wanted to go long, just not at this price...so shorting today seemed like the sensible option ;)

Yes I can see this stock going to at least $30
I love your work, keep it up.
but i want it now! 😡. and my calls are down 50% haha
Very interesting post.  Thanks.

On your 3rd point, I am wondering if in addition to the delta implications of people moving further OTM from ITM calls expiring tomorrow, wouldn't there also be a dynamic of being able to afford fewer contracts even at the same strike price since the time premium will be higher?  So even if 100% of people rebought immediately at the same strike price expiring next week, the number of shares MM would need to hold will fall because the number of contracts will be fewer.  Not sure if this thinking is correct.
OP probably asked people to do his homework for him in school.
$80 to $160, although I suspect we will only get to about $50 tomorrow

prepare to lose inordinate amounts of money in new and interesting ways

or if you're not stupid, prepare to make inordinate amounts of money in new and interesting ways
Man fuck that, should still be going up. That’s nothing for energy
I bought 1000 shares at $4 and sold at $3.80. My worst paper hands moment.
Its crazy how much wsb has changed. Back when I joined in 2017 there was insane amount of DD but if you hopped into a position after wsb hyped it up you were going to lose money 9 times out of 10. Now fast forward now the DD is trash but if you hop in a meme stock when wsb is talking about it 9 times out of 10 you are making money.
Remind me! 70 days ARKX
They were fuk anyway
Put/Call ratio is at the lowest levels (e.g. euphoric high) since the late 1990s dot-com era.

...excuse me while I go set some stop-limits.
BB price prediction Jan 2022?
For sure lol. I have some money I wouldn't miss so I'm following DFV's meme train. 

I closed today 25% up on what ended up being GME 4/16 24c so hopefully the DD and BS all over this sub is right. If not, not sleep lost. If so, I'm printing tendies :D
Ok tards listen up...... with so much call gamma rolling off GME tomorrow the MMs will be selling shares like crazy all day.  It is probably going to pin and trade sideways...... but it is just a breather.  The shorts are nowhere near covered here.  On Monday the squeeze will really start to move.  Tomorrow on dips is a good day to load up.
If you hate money, sure.
didn’t realize reddit is a blog.
Let's start the AMC short squeeze.
Am I retarded? I bought two 15C 21JAN/**2022**

First option purchase ever, figured since it's that far away it could technically grow more..
GMEtards keep buying boys. Started at 300 now at 550 shares. Am I gonna buy more yes and yes
UNLIMITED POWWWERRRR
There are girls here?
🚀🚀🚀
Yes.
Not gonna lie. My asshole feels more vulnerable than it ever has right now. Please tweet something daddy Cohen to make me feel better.
I hope it pops for you bro. Legit don’t give a shit about the shares just wanted the premium
Hey can someone link me to the dude who looks like a penis that said he checked WSB and determined his next short was GME?
$XL all the way. Great price, primed for reversal. Stim announcement going to boost EV big time and $XL with most potential to squeeze up a bunch!
But does s/he deserve salvation? I think not in this case! Lol
I could say something about the diversification of an ETF but this is r/wsb so no one wants actual stability.

EQNR is worth watching I guess. I saw the news I don't know much about their fundamentals. But then again, you could just YOLO like an autist.
Glad to hear that!
That was all my parents would let me borrow. 😂
why BB?
Lol, we've been around here for a while hearing GME stuff.

Optimistic stuff on the F word was like $25.

We can give board member Cohen a double bump to $50.
Fucking lol.

In WSB we trust. My DD is WSB
you held ? sell the news bro
wsb.. why did our hype work for GME but not PLTR??
Booooooo
GME hasn’t peaked yet! Tomorrow, we choose lambo colors!
An index fund follows an index. Not all ETFs follow an index, there are funds that follow different sectors like ARK and it's various funds. There are also funds that follow different asset classes i.e commodities, precious minerals, bonds, reality.
Ideally sure. But that's trying to time the market, and being risky instead of locking in profits.
Yes
Bought 300 shares because of STIC when I saw this news
got a billy riding on this one boys, let's fuck  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Fair value would be around between 70 and 90. But if a short squeeze happens, and it's becoming increasingly likely there will be, it can shoot up to infinity basically, and that's not a joke. 

Tesla is at the end of a year long short squeeze now and google Volkswagen short squeeze to get an idea just how high (albeit for a very short time) this can go. 

For gme the rough estimate is that it would go to at least 150, but if the squeeze is extremely brutal, it could go to 400 or higher (the aim of this sub is 420.69). 

But even with the current price the company is still heavily undervalued. Market cap is now 2.78B. in previous console cycles it always hit at least 4B. So even without Cohen and potential short squeeze this stock would go up this year. Cohen makes this a solid value stock while the short squeeze is pure rocket fuel.
Can you get me one too? I could use a few extra identities.
buying back in for another pump!
Because half of my life savings is on this lol

Think it could go back up?
and then beyond
Was holding ICLN Feb for a while but the theta decay is real on that position. Still sold it at a big profit, but it was plummeting this past week even though the stock was going up. Glad I got out when I did.

Not shitting on ICLN, still big bullish on it and will probably re-up, but I’d go at least March or April. Not only because of what I mentioned earlier, but because it will take at least that long to write and then move any meaningful energy legislation through congress—even with a Dem majority.
Glad I was in aroind 0.42 price point. FDA pushing reviews back due to Covid did delay this company. Nice CGM device that would actually be a benefit to diabetes and last longer than dexcom device.
Sounds like a plan. I have the same ones as you for Feb but I'm negative... also holding amd and you know how this week went
Oh we already on that one 😎

Trying to run LEAPS out of my Roth IRA but fucking Vanguard not clearing my shit for days.
Nice, can I have some of your money please?
I have 3 monthly payers that I roll between.  Each one ends on a different week.

This week HNDL pays out (ex date was today). I’ll wait for the share price to recover and roll to the next one.  If it recovers by next week, then I sell and buy KBWD which has an ex date of the 19th.  I’ll do the same and purchase YYY the following week.  If all goes well, I collect about 2% on my money in a month.  If the share price doesn’t recover enough, I just keep holding.  Been doing this successfully for a few months now and hope to yield about 25% on the year with my idle cash -  it mind blowing when looking in relations to the rest of my portfolio but way better than the .01% I was getting by just letting it sit as cash in my account.

The worst case scenario is a catastrophic share price collapse like in March.  In that case, just hold witch ever etf you happen to have and wait for recovery while collecting dividend.  Bonus is dollar cost averaging, your dividend payouts will buy even more shares and it’ll be a extra little bit when the share price recovers.
Awesome!
This is how I feel about NOK.
I remember when everyone was bearish on fb since they thought their advertisements would take a hit and he cucked all the gay bears at earnings. He will do it again
Lol People were saying "Blockbuster", still makes me chuckle
No problem! I started work remotely so I haven't met him in person but on my first day at work we had a virtual Q&A with him which was pretty cool haha
Xpev, you missed the finance deal from the banks. Have them, but got a feeling they are gonna have more turbulence. Hoping for continuous good ER, deliveries and news on their sedan following the ET7.
I'm just stating the reason as to why it was flagged as suspicious
I remember when it was 20/share and I was like, man IV is insane, no way I’m buying calls?
Is AAPL the 2nd most shorted stock after TSLA or what, why the fuck is it always red when there's positive news. EV announcement? Every other EV but AAPL goes up. Good phone sales? Welp time to go down. It's like AAPL holders are 90% "sell the news" retarded boomers.
If you are committed to the cause then you will EXERCISE at least half of those. Then you can double dip on your gains by riding it out until the squeeze and writing OTM weekly covered calls that the rest of us tards will scoop up 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

PS- congrats and F U
Up big on BB and seriously mad at myself for not buying more. Damn.
Threw $5k on 8c 1/15 this morning
Tomorrow will decide whether I lose all my gains for the week or not
What time tonight is the speech do you know?
Also there’s a rumor Ark is doing a Aerospace ETF so that should pump a little if true.
A more realistic comparison would be chewy or Amazon which both trade around 4x P/S. That would put us right around $300/share. That could easily happen for sure. It could also not happen but still the Coehn story yields a lot of growth. Weighing both potential options I see $90 as pretty fair
barclays ?
Man what a day. BB is gonna print so hard tomorrow.
Who are you exactly?
Kind of crazy everyone, including me, just remembers them for that period of time when businesses had them for work phones lmao

Why people saying big tech will go down
Wouldn't surprise me one bit if one or more foreign powers egged on those clown insurrectionists. 

Doesn't absolve them of blame of course, just more proof of their stupidity. :/
Wtf does that mean? The sky is blue... make decisions accordingly.
SIR YES SIR I DIDNT EVEN READ YOUR DD
has he ever set a squeeze valuation?

is it even possible to set one?
very well done.
Don’t forget, market is closed on Monday. MLK day
I'll be covering their mama tonight.
Lolol
Either this or BB!!
I missed the peak too, when it spiked to 43.00 for a few minutes.
My fun portfolio is up over 100% this week :)

Interesting take. You're right about that.
Bull sentiment is at an ATH - it might come down in the next few days or weeks - but be patient in timing it
Eat cock
and we have a masssiver users big BIG wallet after TSLA and GME , all of us are fking multi millonaire!
You have to pay your broker interest on shares you short.
Wake me up when we're mentioned in a college textbook.
These are good tips. Thank you.

I would do that, at least partially.
It is not a zero sum game
Ya.  Sadly i can't buy anything till tomm.  But looks like a phenomenal buy right now.  Ill grab some leaps and shares tomm.  

Can you guys calm down for like... a few hours so i can get in under 10 lol.

Giod 4 you 👍
wtf why??!?!?
So pussbois really selling out of tech to... bonds? Lmao boomer clowns 🤡
nice
Oh fucj I bought 3 PLTR calls for 600
I still don’t get this idea of wanting to live of dividends.
It’s a purely emotional endeavor and there is no advantage over stocks with low or zero dividends.

Chasing stocks with high yield will likely result in underperformance because of value traps. Total return is the only metric that matters ignoring risks.

I hear it's 10 bucks he borrowed from his destitute mother
I saw this and bought real quick 500 @ $1.05, but then saw you got flagged...I forgot about new rules if you include a YouTube link...and was worried and glad I only got 500...when it hit $1.46...not so worried...thx
I made 12k in trades today with just 1k, follow the meme stocks. you'll have diamonds soon king
BB GOING TO THE MOON. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Not enough GME posts. So what’s the EOD tomorrow? 8.5$ gain today. Possibly 10$? 50$ EOD? 💦💦💦🍆🍆🍆🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I’d be yelling WHO AHHH YA about that win all day.
Everyone getting worried about ICLN. Remember dems have control for at least 2 years. No way this doesn’t go up. Buy the f’in dip. Also BB & MT to the moon.
 Cmon it can’t go up forever...can it???
I have leaps on ICLN.
and so begins the real shorting lol, wonder where or who owns those shares he will exercise.
Fucked. Happy cake day. 

I just set up my first 401k through my new job and I can’t even pick my own stocks, just a couple indexes. Should I switch it over to a Roth? They match for both
Yeah man. Big divergent low. Holding it too.
Lol no way. That's a bearish sign thought because I'm assuming at some point (march cough) people will try and take long cap gains treatments and something big might happen?
You have to let them expire and lose all of your money. Unless they gain value tomorrow and are able to be sold.

Sorry, I’m just honestly mad, not your fault I know
Are you from the future? Your date says it’s Friday already
Imagine netting $4.2m in 72 hours...this is simply amazing.

I agree with ya with Motley Fool's services, but their "investing basics" session offers decent information. That's all I recommend to people. I don't really believe in their services either and have never used those paid services.

this idiot on yahoo thinks we're penny stock pumpers

I've been there and done that. All it takes is to buy when you see something going up, and sell at the first sign of red, the first pullback that makes you think "shit shit shit its going to $0". 

I personally have lost money on the most bullish stock of last year because I couldn't handle a small pullback.
ah good one. ill add that in later.
;)
Just bought 15 shares of BB and a 12c 3/19. Still holding GME too. 💎🙌 all day
Watch BB hit $30 in a couple weeks
He has a whole tax plan planned out
That depends.  Will you miss that 8k? Cause it's gone
Being up 122% today does not compensate the pain of being down 75% yesterday. Sea shanty 2 again tonight for me
You if you don't sell
Same
After hours price is at 1.35
As someone that just made a killing (for me) on GME and has been taking profits along the way I appreciate some good DD about the other side of the trade.  


One thing I'm curious about though: Tomorrow's selling event you predict here is a one-day event. And since options don't trade pre-market it would necessarily take place during trading hours. Why would I hedge for a one-day, market hours only, event by buying a put expiring next week which will have a much higher IV and be more expensive due to theta when I can just buy much cheaper 0-day puts to cover my ass tomorrow?
That’s the plan it was shit EOD
🐐
PLTR is longer term and is not a short squeeze risk.  GME has specific dates for said squeeze
I thought poor people don’t invest in the market?
Do it homie
What a day
PLTR wasn’t a short squeeze
Market is stupid.

Under appreciated gem on the verge of going parabolic 🚀🚀🚀
yeah it has been that way for a hot minute though. There is no indication that things will collapse especially not with current fiscal/monetary policies in place. The housing market is in the exact same situation. It really sucks for young people but it is almost certainly a better move to get into both real estate and stocks now rather than wait for a collapse.
Man sorry you got that dumb flag. Doesn't make sense. It is one of the better dd that I've seen recently. Nicely put together with useful information but not too dense. Anyway grabbed 1k shares and I'm up bigly 😁
Pltr is shit and GME isn’t
Everybody always saying “RIP bears”. They’ve all been dead for a while. I think we can stop that now
You still might profit, but generally buying OTM calls that expire next day is very stupid. Its always safe to just buy slightly ITM calls for a bit longer period out
This DD was really good and posted in like November

This is so unhelpful. Trading is hard to learn. That's why 95% of people fail at it. A brother is trying and making his way AND he turned a profit. Why bother with the 'index fund kool aid' bit?

Bill Gates could probably have made more putting his savings in an index fund than his first year starting Microsoft.
Its already spiking in the mornings to 43-44. I believe LOGITECHs earnings may bump it to high 40s next week
Expire tomorrow... are they worthless or ITM?
I suppose that's possible, but they write most of the options at least on one side.
Will be yolo-ing 1k in it. It's not much but it's all I've got

whats the plan with the remaining shares?
Time in the market is better than timing the market.

Invest in companies that you trust, believe in, have good products and good executives.
Hm, how many trades have you done? You have to do a certain number of trades before you’re eligible but I have no idea what that number is.

This is an interesting article on the potential of the retirement age changing for Social Security and the impact on benefits.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/how-raising-the-social-security-retirement-age-could-affect-benefits.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/how-raising-the-social-security-retirement-age-could-affect-benefits.html)

As much of this community plans to retire well before SS kicks in I am interested to hear if anyone was counting on this in the later years.  My plan is to not count on Social Security but hope its there as an extra cushion.
If it's one sell order it should be categorized as one round trip.

The market is closed now, so there is nothing to do. 
What are these options and how much did you pay for them?

Worst case, you can let them expire worthless and lose whatever you paid for them.

Margin is borrowed money. Robinhood (or any broker) makes money on margin by charging interest on anything you borrow. 

Many brokers will allow you to borrow margin at a rate of 1:2 to hold overnight. This means that if you have $10k, you can borrow a total of $10k margin. Just like any mob boss, Robinhood expects you to pay back the loan (go figure). If your account value drops below the margin maintenance requirement, they are at risk of losing their initial loan and will either issue a margin call or forcefully sell some of your assets to make back the loan. Most brokers will give you a couple of days to resolve a margin call before forcefully selling anything (assuming the value doesn't continue to drop).

While the standard margin overnight borrow rate is 1:2, many brokers also allow you to borrow even higher ratios for day trading. TD Ameritrade offers day trade buying power at a 1:4 ratio. All of this additional margin must be sold at the end of each day (or you will again enter a margin call). 

Stocks that are more volatile will have an additional margin concentration requirement. If a stock has a concentration requirement of 50% and you are using margin, you cannot invest more than 50% of your total portfolio into that stock without inflicting a margin call. 

Margin maintenance is recalculated at the start of each trading day. As long as your account value is above the new maintenance level when it is recalculated, then you will exit the calll... Although if you enter the call again that same day it might count as a continuation of the previous days call??

Over the past few years I've entered margin calls only a handful of times. To avoid calls I make it a habit to only borrow a maximum of 75% of my margin balance and keep 50% of my portfolio in long term growth stocks (ones that don't have concentration requirements). This means that if I have a 1:2 ratio and $10k in my account, I will generally swingtrade 75% or $7.5k margin. This gives me a bit of a buffer incase my stocks decide to walk off a cliff that day. Anything over 1:2 I will sell at the end of the day regardless of my profit/loss.

I just bought calls on the FB dip. It’s down like 10% over speculative fears that Dems want to fuck with big tech. Also bought Twitter calls too, nobody cares trump was banned from these platforms. Needless to say FB 275c 2/12 and TWTR 50c 2/12
BB after hours is making me 💦
Yep perfect thanks. I’m fairly new and have been stressing myself out each day following stock. I think I’m going to let this one run for a while and chill out a bit.

I actually vividly remember this, lost some money back then and just gave up. But literally back in that time, it was 9/10 a fade and youd profit going the other way lmao. crazy how times have changed.
If you can guess the market right, and you're not getting screwed by the market, yes.  Absolutely.  Hands down, 1000%.

But on average you're not right.  You're going to get it wrong.  You will lose these calls.  Look at the loss porn.  Study them.  Those are calls.  If they bought shares and just held and moved on with their lives they'd be fine.

The honest most accurate call- and this is the most boring answer- is to have time in the market and to not to try to time the market.

Just buy some shares in something you think works, or you have a hunch on, and forget about them till a few years later or when the market rallies on something and you think you need to make a move.   And just keep piling on new shares, market up or down.  It adds up.

They exercised a 40 call at the 41 strike point when for a 3$ profit instead of selling it to the market for 8$? Are you sure?

https://imgur.com/03Ooosj

When exactly do you think these were exercised?

See that's similar to my game plan but its in my quarterlies that I roll while the monthlies are more static.

It's all about the daily.
Sprinkle in a little MT and you have a well diversified portfolio. Can’t go tits up.
I thought they were all in XOM and BA
And rockets
Goldman going to the moon?
Those projects are already being funded. It's not a pipedream. There are already billions of dollars being pumped into these projects. They aren't creating rockets to do nothing my friend.

I've also worked on Lunar Gateway projects at my college in collaboration with NASA, so I know quite a bit about their roadmap and plans. There is already money invested into making this happen at this very moment stuff is being researched and developed.

Also, I don't know if you have paid any attention, but the space industry is swinging toward the private sector because private companies are showing better results and promise of much higher profit margins. Look at SpaceX for example and companies such as Relativity, Rocket Lab, and Axiom (to name a few). These are companies built privately who are making a way into the market by showing faster progress than bigger companies with bigger budgets.

Stop making statements that you have no basis for. You lack understanding about the industry and that's okay, bit stop making uneducated assumptions.
Cause they don’t understand the market
I personally love salesforce. Just entered a long position at 216. I think this will bounce  next earnings!

Woman doctor? No thanks
Adding one thing here: 

The further a call is from an expiration date, the more time value it has (eg. there's more time for the stock price to rise even more), which factors into the option price too.

So if your call has shot up in value, then waiting until expiration might lose you $ if the stock price plateaus, as there will be time value decay. 

I'm also rtrd when it comes to this but pretty sure this is true

I'll wait for everyone to sell and then buy as much as I can! Thanks Trump 🚀🚀🚀🚀
How? 
If it goes to $50 I make the money between my strikes. 
If it goes to $100 I still get money and my other uncovered GME calls print. 
If it goes to $20 I locked in some profit.
Bought 5 times, sold twice, rest expired.

Why the drop? V and MA
3:45? More like 3:59. But if GME is at 45, I'd definitely dump or substantially downrisk at that point. Some chance of an accepted share selloff on tuesday, but less likely than the monetized call selloff friday. If Tuesday open was up, I'd be totally out at that point.
How’s this possible, what are calls how do they work? Yep I am a knowledge less retard, I’ll just buy some more gme stocks it’s all I know

Chinese stocks are not for me. Just don't want to put money there.
Uhhh no.

Mr. Biden will detail his plans, which he and his economic team have been honing for weeks, in an evening speech in Delaware. The efforts will cover the pandemic, the economy, health care, education, climate change and other domestic priorities, Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National Economic Council, said at the Reuters Next conference on Wednesday.

...

The proposals in the second tranche are likely to be larger than the first, and Democrats plan to pay for all or some of them by raising taxes on corporations and the rich. The second package is expected to be centered on job creation and infrastructure, including hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on clean energy projects like electric vehicle charging stations, along with health care and education spending, Mr. Biden’s team and leading congressional Democrats have indicated.
In all honesty it worries me a tad. Having financial knowledge is paramount. But many people who I’ve talked to that got into stocks aren’t ‘investing,’ they’re trading. They will ask me about a stock, but none of them ask me about a balance sheet or cash flow or portfolio construction. At some point this will matter. Though I don’t know when. For a lot of people I think automated investing into ETFs is the best cost/benefit situation.

But many will realize that we do live in a capitalist world and owning stakes in businesses is a great way to accrue wealth, which ultimately leads to more freedom.

I’m very excited for the long term out some of more democratized markets. The commission-free world will undoubtedly have growing pains. But overall I view it as a good thing. Just get ready for the ride.
These never ending hit pieces won’t shake my diamond hands.

Yes
Yeah, I always respect people who can see a crash coming and get out (or profit on the way down with shorts).  We need the pessimists and realists, especially in bubble mania.  The problem seems to be that so few know when to *get back into the market* that limits the upside, even if you're a genius and spot the correction coming the day before it happens.

There has been a ton of DD on GME. Here is just one of many examples giving highlights as to why GME is positioned to move. The main motivator is short interest outweighs float, and Ryan Cohen and his team joining the board.

That toaster design is a real turn-off to some judging a book by its cover not digging deeper to realize the body design concept means shit for these cars since they all share the same chassis anyway.

Still feeling bullish because I don't see any red flags - we'll get a pop soon. I just added more shares to my position at the closing price.
I’m deep ITM in yolo right now
If I were to pick TD, Fidelity, Etrade, etc etc, which is the best option? I'm in Pacific Time

I heard Fidelity doesn't have commission but what is their brokerage fees for each transaction?

I heard TD has brokerage fees but have not heard anything about commission.
Yep, short squeeze. When shorts are covered, it will be seen when GME goes parabolic af.
BAC calls are so cheap I’m bag holding
Here’s your gold, sucker.

At least long enough. Likely longer than that.
i gambled my life savings away in hopes of paying off my student loans cause i already gots a house
Right before market closed 12 contracts for tomorrow expiry. Hope it moons to $11.
This stock isn’t available on Robinhood that’s unfortunate

BB $10C 3/19
BB is king!
Yeah I think I am mistaken, thanks
I agree with hold onto yer buttocks. He makes alot of valid points that we as a community, really need to consider if we want to grow our sub reddit into something that we can be really proud of one day. Let us all reminence and make sure that we are following the rules, which clearly state : "thow shall only talk FIRE"
Any BB call will print
Also what is he trading on? Looks professional.
Stop stop I can get only get so erect! 🚀🚀🚀
In relation to GME and the short squeeze, what happens when a member of retail buys a put? Does it have any effect?
I hate this shit so much but I'm loaded with calls and holding
Sounds like Melvin trying to instigate some sell off. Been seeing a lot of these today. Good effort.
My 2 whole shares salute your 15 with pride and admiration.
You remember what IV was when you bought in?
Oh I agree, financial independence is the fuckin' GOAL for me too. The benefit of not working on happiness cannot be understated. But until you get there, most of us suckers cobbling a nest egg together, the value of cash flow of (in OP's case above) $100K annually toward that nest egg cannot be understated either. For the average upper-middle class joe every $100K you can throw at retirement and investments has incredible potential imo
It’s literally up 70% already wtf are u talking about
When squeeze is squozing, everyone will want that call.
So  what's the next GME, BB? AMC?  
i need money to satisfy my girlfriends before jamal steals her from me
Yes, the deeper ITM they are the less volume there will be, which tends to lead to a larger gap between bid & ask.
Think it was a 100k at one point dude was down like 40-50 percent I think and despite that dude didn’t even flinch. Dude deserves every fucking dollar for sticking to his guns gme king 🤴.
every trader fucks up, it's part of growing ;)

read some trading books, listen to podcasts,
learn to see the market through many different eyes.

steal ideas, refine your system, apply what you decided,
review what works, rinse & repeat.
Sad cause I'm finally gonna sell GME. Happy cause I'm using it to make gains on BB.
ah bummer ill make an edit.
Rotate GME gainz into PLTR
ALWAYS! Never fails 😂😂
Gay
u already know AMD hitting 120 in february
Ya but I don't have the cash for it unless I sell another couple shares should I stranger
Hope you all bought your puts. Mooning for the stimulus was too obvious. 3 day weekend too.
I bought 100 shares of Carnival in March at $10ea and it has doubled in price. I originally bought in order to cash in on the onboard credit they give you if you own 100 shares, so i figured that over time, with enough cruises it would pay for itself. I may sell this March though and be happy with the 100% profit. Time will tell.
What about my civil right to trade on weekdays?
Strap in you retard we’re going to the moon and celebrating with tendies after🚀🚀🚀

This whole thread makes me feel so much better about my missed gains.
It is hard to understate how much having a kid will change your life and your relationship with your partner. Family decisions are a higher order question than FIRE timeline.

Children will slow your wealth accumulation. They will slow your travel experience. They will limit your social opportunities. They will give you perspective and force you to grow. Kids will change your life- you either want to buy the ticket or you don't, FIRE is not a special consideration in this domain. 

Also paying off debts is savings. Might make you feel better about your progress.

APHA is the only one holding me up, thank you APHA
the mods gave me approval to post this, so I’m confused
That article is fucking stupid though, there's no way we collectively hot up the price this much, a lot of it was outside investors. Plus, the squeeze hasn't even squoze
Promotion and bet payout incentives it’s expected when jumping into new areas
Yea i’ve invested in those companies for long term but out of educating myself i just wanted to learn how to invest in penny stocks
Use an options calculator
Huge float, no catalyst like the GME, no high short interest, and the massive market cap compared to revenue and non existent earnings in the conpanys life hurt as well
Ok sold

Woof woof what’s the potential here autists?
Oooo finally one I haven't missed out on!  Bought BB awhile ago a bit under 6 bucks. Currently at 11.xx. Dare I buy more? Or do I ride my 100 shares straight to the top!?
Who the fuck is buying DASH at this level?

They hate us cuz they ain't us.
BB to $30 by March!! 🚀🚀
One of the most undervalued stocks on the market

Truly baffling
a - Dump, into the teens 

b- Dump, into the 20s

c - Flat if not broker liquidated, and then stock can go up easier the following week because the float would get really narrow.
I regret not buying more calls at open. Got one leap but was planning to get some monthlies/quarterlies too and then got distracted until after IV soared
$50 EOD LEEGOO 🚀🚀🚀

I sold 25% today. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to lock it in around 1100% gain, but I've got a lot more I'm holding on to and will be following it for a while.
That's a good point. Fucking holidays. 😒
What happens if those contracts expire in regards to the stock price?
so if r/all invades us and buys GME we're heading to deep space.
you had me wet all day. Can I get you off?

No worries man. Was -40% once too!

Thanks a lot for the reply, I didn’t know much about options and this helped me get a grasp on it. So your option of $12.50 on Feb 12 is pretty solid since it’s already at 9.40-ish, right?

I mean I've done my DD and had an opportunity to buy below $100. Was too expensive then and it still is today. I'll be keeping an eye on what happens tomorrow.
This is gold
210c. 

I also bought a few that expire in February in case the stock lollygags tomorrow/next week.
Contrary to what people gonna tell you "INDEX FUNDS TO DA MOON" I believe congrats to you and I think stock picking is the future. Another thing look into options trading whole different animal but much more rewarding be prepared to lose money until you get good.

Hell yes. My favorite post. Fuck Melvin tomorrow!
I didn't all in, just made a sensible though large bet.
It sold the news after CES, and yeah people thinking the new CEO will magically fix Intel's massive manufacturing problems.
What are you buying, stock or options? And how long are you planning to hold?

I think earnings will be great, especially given the huge covid boost. But sometimes the market has a weird reaction to AMD earnings so it's honestly hard to say - Just look how irrational the stock is right now over the new Intel CEO. If you are holding for a few months I wouldn't sweat about it, and if you're planning to hold long term then it might be worth buying Xilinx stock instead (if you think the buy out will happen). You would get 1.7234x AMD shares in return if it happens. 
If you're yoloing options then I suggest getting more advice from r/amd_stock

Except their balance sheet and earnings are positive, and they've had over 300% growth in e-commerce. I don't think it will go up to $200 and stay they, but it'll get short squeezed until the bears are dry and probably settle back down to $40-50.
Too risky and the interest is way too high.  Use margin of you have to or get a second job only for stocks.
$55 by tomorrow...lol
I posted an update.  I don't think you guys get any kind of notice tho?

Huh? Def need a link to this chief.
The rocket is already out of the atmosphere now. You should start praying to Melvin to keep it away from the moon for 1 more day.
ive traded the same 125 shares 20 times. They haven't been margin called. One of the shorting institutions said so in a comment.

https://imgur.com/zYwFYvc
🚀🚀🚀🚀🛰
They expire tomorrow, so they will be at their intrinsic value. I don't want to sell the calls, because only MM is buying the calls right now. Need to soak up as many shares as possible to lock up the liquidity and lower supply. Low supply +high demand
Also, this is a super embarrassing question, but I don’t know what an IPO is, and even when googling it, I don’t seem to find any sites that can explain everything in layman’s terms for beginners, do you have any website recommendations?
u went all in naked calls huh?
70 tomorrow hopefully let’s go
ACEV , I’m pretty super bullish about this company from everything I read . Long term hold for sure.

Its really an undervalued company, Deals with amazon, partners with 60% of the EV manufacture markets.

Compared to other companies doing the same or lesser things it should be higher.

I actually started my investments by analyzing my budget and cutting out luxuries including starbucks, started buying $8 wine instead of $20, cutting out a few movie channels I didn't watch, things like that that added up a a few hundred a month that went into stocks.  It was the basis of my seed money, and in a few years with some investment gains put a down payment on my first home with some left over to keep playing the market.

Thanks for that. Very, very helpful.

As I've only traded stocks I've grown to try and buy on down days when an opportunity arises. No way to time the bottom but it helps me psychologically to accept large changes in a stock if I don't buy on FOMO days.

I guess what I'm trying to understand is it a stock takes a sharp dip one day I know exactly what I'm getting that share at in comparison to what it was before the movement.

How is that same movement measured in an option? Is it best to buy an option on a down day..or is that downward movement going to be reflected in the options contact the following day? 

Does the timing matter as much?
Burry was buying GME when it was at $3-$5
UP THEN SIDEWAYS
BABA please hold these gains, ok?

This bitch always gives up its gains in some oscillating bullshit. 

Straight up motherfucker. Next stop $300.

Please and thanks!!!

That’s where the GameStop will make money!, you still need hardware to play game on the cloud and do you think future parents will take their kids to buy joystick, strip club led lights at Walmart? 

They go to GameStop! so they get joystick, get a silicone protector, a Funko statue, hookers, and a Minecraft t-shirt

It's an OTC stock, and RH does not offer access to OTC markets. I use TD's ThinkorSwim as my primary account/platform and Schwab as a backup.

The market being closed on MLK day is actually retarded
Could this be potentially the pandas over at Melting Capital hedging? Or would that only fuck them harder on covering? What's stopping them from perhaps just riding the squeeze with us by buying these ridiculous calls then covering and at very least breaking even or better. Anyone know the math?

Research? There's things called fundamentals that exist.
Statistics — it takes some critical thinking 

“Powder cocaine is the most commonly used stimulant in the UK. The prevalence of use in the last year reported in England and Wales in 2018 to 2019 (2.9%) was the highest since 2008 to 2009.”

In for 10k shares, going all in once my funds settle from DKNG.
You technically are with the management fees of \~45bps (if I remember correctly). That's in the not egregious, but not cheap range. I think fair for getting broad market exposure and a passive manager. There are other ETFs where I would not pay that (for example, IPAY as it is fairly easy to put together a portfolio of Visa, Square, PayPal, and Mastercard, and you generally should do better).
bb will do
1, read GME carefully through

2, scan & scroll the rest
Shit man, I'm just trying to stop being poor. If *that's* greed then the fuck is the rest of society?

GME short squeeze is one of the greatest stock market events over the last 100 years

WSB autists unite
Aunt Cathie 💕
Lose all of the money as in the total cost of the contract? So if I’m negative, I’m having trouble understanding the total amount I’m about to lose.. it’s a 1/15 call on Mara. I’m down -42%. Will I only lose up to my initial investment? Or can it be worse?
I am with you. 

250 shares at open tomorrow. 

My pockets are starting to weigh cash heavy. 

All you GME autists, buy BBBY and lets send this out of this universe tommorow.
Does a bear shit in the woods
I mean... why not just envision like a cappuccino or something
Well, if you are long the stock you could do that, but if you buy the 0 dte put, and it comes into the money in the liquidation selloff near the close, it gets swept up too because my broker won't want me holding 50k shares short of GME on margin unless I have a few million in cash sitting around. The brokerage liquidation rules are the challenge with that, since the greatest selling would likely be out of those same brokerage liquidations.
Stop fucking around bro, I see those % of holdings scores. You gotta go ballz DEEEEEEPPPPPPPPP. Gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers
All aboard the BB train!!! 🚂🚂🚂
Incredible how so many retards in one Reddit can make it so far.
hahahahaha.....yeah, ok....

Dude this shit ain’t even squeezed yet

Big = good? Or bad?

I'm currently holding 200 shares... Bought at $32...
Hell yeah! A little over a week ago I didn't know shit about stocks or options but thanks to the retards here I've doubled my 2k investment in that time.  And thanks to APHA/TLRY of course. I've put 1k in APHA stocks, 500 in TLRY and 500 for 10x 11$ APHA calls expiring 1/29. It's going to the fucking moon! Especially after Biden announces legalization or decriminalization later this month. 

I've only made 2k but this shit it's so exciting I think I'm slightly autistic now. I only wish I had more capital to spend right now.
Can't afford it I believe, was 2M to exercise

So no green energy.
Thats not how you spell retarded
My $GME price target for my measly 600 shares is 115.70. Gives me a nice sum of $69420.
new strat should be to push this post to #1 r/all, tell people it's free money if they buy a share or two, and watch GME shoot straight up

Just ignore it, your post is good.

PLUG a good lesson in why it's just never a good idea to open a swing call position on something with a 90+ daily RSI like I saw a bunch of people do last night "because biden speech"

everything basically has a 100% chance of having a dump day once they get that overbought.
I might’ve missed out on GME but no way I’ll miss out on BB. All in baby
This sounds like some triple witching hour shit
GET FUCKED
Idk I opened a put spread today, somehow managed to make a profit on our calendars I had 2 weeks ago (110p feb and March).. damn stocks is up close to 100 dollar from an already overvalued base
7:30 est tonight. Hold
O didn't drip, they increased the shares by 3% and price dropped by about 3$. In reality the value of one share did not change.
More BB calls and stonks tomorrow
worthless? dude they were pretty deep ITM
Hey man, congrats on restarting. Stocks is completely new to me but i gave it a go. I invested $100 into tesla but im clueless what to do but ive been researching a bit to learn the stocks. Any advice for a noobie like me? Appreciate any help! (Any videos/articles/books also really appreciated)

He has never set a precise squeeze valuation.  He’s actually mentioned many times that it’s extremely hard to predict when/what will happen in a squeeze scenario, and he tries to stay away from that.  He was investing in GameStop based off of just the fundamental valuation.

Originally he thought the “infinity squeeze” was actually a really low chance of happening.  But now with more recent events, it’s become more probable.  Still no guarantee it’ll happen.

In one of his first videos he posted, it’s titled “GameStop $5 to $50”.  So it seems his original targets were thinking they could be worth $50 a share if all went to plan.  But that was even before Ryan Cohen invested/joined the board of GameStop.  Now that he’s on the team, all bets are off for what the future holds.  

$50+ is extremely realistic now, and $100+ within the next couple years is possible too, again assuming all goes to plan. This is just based off Fundamentals alone, nothing to do with the MOASS.

In a few lifetimes you'll have a share of TSLA
When young ppl make money they are called gamblers.


When old ppl make money they are called investors.


Remember that 🌈
GOEV- lowish market cap and huge upside as their EV partnerships increase. And their potential tie in to an Apple EV.

MGNI- With comparisons to TTD they have significant room to grow. And being a SSP in the AdTech space, they will grow as more companies come out of COVID and spend more on advertising.
Just opened a Robinhood because of u guys and my childhood friends text thread
WSB resembles a boiler room more by the day. Completely organized pump and dumps. People making a lot of money by front running these scams and then working up fervor with orchestrated posts. Should we all buy $BB tomorrow?

What they aren't telling you is that options decay over time. If the share price is flat or even increases but not at the rate you need it to, you'll bleed money until it's all gone. High risk high reward. Shares are much better for your peace of mind. The autist schtick of this subreddit came about because the only people throwing this amount of money at ridiculously risky calls are retards.

i need TLRY $20 uh oh im retarded
This is the way
I think this varies a lot by industry.  As a former software developer that did tons of interviews, for example, I can say I genuinely did not care about titles, only current ability.  But I can easily see where that might not be the case in a different field.

Do you have any visibility into the hiring process in your current gig? How heavily is title weighed?
What makes you say that?
Check out r/pennystocks, but understand that penny stocks often see less success so can be a larger risk of losing everything.
Make sure you sell . Pay off everyone and live good for awhile

Why don’t you contact TradeZero and see. I’m currently trying out their platform and man are that charts buggy. Let me know if you find this out.

Have you been with TradeZero long? Can you tell me how you like them overall?
Well, I have a new sub to explore. Thank you!
Right after the new year - it was like 5% per day for  4-5 days people rushed back (myself included "as it was a bargain" then by ~March down another 30-40%.
I'm a poor boy but I don't need much! With this, I'm essentially financially independent... Which is a fucking blessing.
Should I sell my MSFT stocks and put it all into $BB tomorrow?
Roaring Kitty, you are the man! I will follow you forever into Valhalla! GME GANG RIDES AGAIN!
If you're investing based on WSB trends, better to be early. Still a dumb move without doing your own outside research, but YOLO!

I do. I will write a DD post. Basic thesis is simple:

F150 is the Macbook of rural America. The boomers want to pump this thing. Americans are leaving cities. They have the fed backing them and money to license tech from whoever they need to. All they need to do is keep pace with regulations, slash their stupid SKUs like hybrid sedans, and sell trucks like there’s no fucking tomorrow. They’re the Vietnam of stocks dude. They don’t need to win, just not lose.
Citi says downgrade? I hear FIRE SALE! ALL IN PLTR

I'm not sure if I got lucky or the hundred hours of YouTube and reading did it for me. But I turned $120 into $1000 my first week with calls. I was busy at work and fucking sold too early and missed out on $4000 though. I also put $1000 into "safe" stocks and that's up like $200 already.
Our time will come we got some stuff coming up like that presentation bullshit they are doing in January also those job offerings at Allianz where they looked for PLTR folks but PLTR doesn't have a contract with Allianz yet so we might see such a contract anytime now. Just hold that shit and we will have our time no doubt, PLTR is too big and too important to fail trust me I'm a retard

It’s just the shell. They’ve been inactive for years.  Any trading on the ticker since August has been on anticipation of the merger with Ameca Mining. 

[Here’s](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15jAtXFFkUFBmcUzGndEbOIUZqrvEUqqme_BhLliR3rc/edit) a deep dive I did on them.
Yes, you lock in profits but you can always come back and cry here when you realize how much you lost in unrealized gains (like I did yesterday).

Although to be fair, you at least sold the call at $6 unlike me who sold lots of $28c at $0.15 each on Monday. RIP me lol.

damn it see see i v has literally fucked m - wait it turned around
Thanks, appreciate it. Apparently mods didn’t even look at it and automatically thought it was a pump rocket stupid ass post 🤦🏻‍♂️
Can you help a newbie what is gtla ?
PLTR, the abandoned prodigal son of WSB, is going to see a massive spike tomorrow. The downward pressure we've seen this week is just compressing that spring, ready to pop all over again. I'm looking for $27 by end of day.
Sir
A few more weeks it says.
If it isn't mentioned tonight, that would fuck a lot of us in the a hole. I got 1/22 ICLN leaps, so I'm not TOO worried, but I want bank.

Have mega shares in ICLN + PBW.
I don't really see why it wouldn't print. We have a year to sit on it. Sure, it needing to grow by around 130% from its current price to break even seems like a tall order, but dontcha think just the hint of the legalization of marijuana would cause the stock to moon? While some may argue that the current price already that speculation taken into consideration, I remain hopeful that there is much more room to grow. I believe Democrats having control of Congress will have a positive effect overall. 

At the time, I actually did a little math when I was trying to decide on whether to get the $30, $40c, $50c, $60c. I just assumed I had a certain amount of cash to burn through, compared it to how many contracts I could get at those strike prices, and picked up the strike price I believed would yield me the most profit by taking in gamma/delta into consideration. That's how I arrived at the $60c option being more profitable than the $40c or the $50c. It never even crossed my mind whether or not it may actually hit that strike price a year from now. 

Keep in mind that as much as I want the stock to shoot way past its strike price, I actually don't even think about if it would or would not. I'm totally okay with collecting on whatever profit there is even after a day or month or several months of holding.
Tomorrow is going to be crazy.
5 Green Day’s short on day 6 is a common system

100% american.  brits are just a sad spectacle of how quickly an empire can fall.  and we seem to be super excited to follow them down the drain.
That seems like it should be enough. Try going to you’re investment profile, should be under your account. Put your experience to expert and goal to speculative training. I heard this has worked for some people
It's a steaming pile of shit that's getting short squeezed.  Some of these guys will make money, the first ones in will make a lot.  Most of these guys will be bagholders.
The internet has changed my life.
SENS, TANH, VBIV

Were? Good news, they still are. Which is why you know this thing still has room to run. The "Blockbuster" people still don't understand.
That's cool, good for them.

Still overvalued.
If you have time to do fundamental analaysis, you can have more positions. But you will always end up needing to update your own targets.
Legend
Probably like 41-42. 

If the shorts do the thing they’re legally suppose to, we’ll likely see the largest upside Tuesday and Wednesday of next week (since Monday the market’s closed).
I heard Biden is gonna pump BB
Oh no.  Boeing already has the 737 max,  which is practically a certified killing machine.
Moon!
Amazon for me. It seems like an obvious win.
When should a poor and stupid idiot sell his stock? I put $250 into the BB and if it goes up tmr should I just pull it all out or what?
Yeah. I think I'm just going to trade the stocks on my own rather than the ETF. Cathie charges too high fees and she may include 3d printing companies and such. I'd rather build my own "ETF" based on what she's looking at.
And statistics. ML is all stats right now
Don't try and change the subject
Not sure if this is what you mean, but keep in mind 1 put = 100 shares. Tomorrow, Melvin has to buy 5,100,000 shares they shorted.
Stop, I'm already dead.

Will do buddy. Thank you.

$BB - Anyone know what time the conference is and how we can follow along?

Makes 7 figures off of a store that rips off kids on used games. This dude fucks
Yea I don’t mind giving advice. I actually work in the industry and am licensed, although not a financial advisor and my friends know that. And the reasons you mentioned are why I would never tell a friend to purchase any Tesla, pltr, gme etc. because as soon as I do, the stock tanks and they get upset.  

When financial conversations come up I just kind of start talking about it and depending on the response I get “man I need to start investing” or “what stock do you like” I will either go more in depth or kind of just shut the conversation down.

The 1 friend (best man at my wedding) who started in July went from asking me if putting money into a Roth was the same as putting money into the market and spending $400 a month on a whole life policy for 250k that his dad was the beneficiary of to now where he’s maxed out 2019 (due to tax extension), almost maxed 2020, and will be working on 2021 and done it while building a decent emergency fund as well. He’s got a financial plan and he feels good about finances. Most people don’t have that.

Long story short, in general maxing a Roth is a smart financial decision for just about anyone, and as the original comment I replied to mentioned, most people don’t really realize they can and have the means to put their money to work to put themselves in a great financial position.
I’ll give one upvote for that info
This was a good one
Fundamental deeznuts
Bought 20.000 shares at that exact price. Strap in bois
Japan lacked any form of fiscal stimulus. That was the major critique of the lost decades. The entirety of action rested on monetary policy to stimulate inflation while the central government remained conservative.
That record is going to be broken when JPow and Yellen convert all the gay bear non-believers
MARA at its pinchpoint on a bull pennant on 1h and 4h chart. Can anyone confirm or reject to this? Been seeing a lot of calls today on it. My guess is the possible $1.9T stimulus bill and hedging against usd.
Thank you!
Why wait?
Have they still got the printer?
How long are you holding gme for
I'll be honest man, I don't click on any link that says "Fox News"
The rules are POSITIONS OR BAN 

No matter how much time you put into the DD, you gotta tell us the positions to take or you have taken so we make the play.
Better be some insanely good numbers lol
what are you talking about?
Then wouldn’t it be a good idea to buy cheap leaps?
The Squozen One! 🙌
+.18 isn’t horrible
I did Google, you’re wrong.
I'm 30, nearing the age where I can't throw half a mil at fds and then look my daughter in the eye and tell her she can't go to college cause I F'ed.
Confirmed, this guy fucks
$GME to the moon. 🚀🚀🚀
I have no idea what PLTR does, and at this point I am too afraid to ask.
trust me i’ve been teaching myself basics. And ik penny stocks r very high risk and almost hundred percent loss. I’m not risking too much money cause like i’ve said it’s more to just expand my knowledge
With GME closing at nearly $40, short positions expiring tomorrow & also OpEx with tons of contracts expiring — GME volume is going to be insane tomorrow, will probably surpass today’s and get close to Wednesday’s volume. Let’s get it boys
My first trade on Robinhood was shares of Maxar at 8.80. Damn, should have stayed. Or TSLA
Bought QLI hoping it would go up but it didn’t. I’m gonna be patient with it for a while. Any thoughts?
Great DD, I’m full into $TANH now🚀🚀🚀🚀
CAN'T STOP WON'T STOP GAME STOP 🚀🚀🚀
Am I dumb for not believing this, or am I dumb for believing this?
Shares, CCs, and leaps baby
Haven't used them in a while, but Finviz can probably answer that for you.
Does anyone have an real hype for why it will go down or up after earnings ? Thinking about that 1/29 play(probably call) and just not looking at my app until then.. anybody?
"elevate levels" it's the only stock with more than 100% short interest lol
I’m in! Thanks
I would never be so gay
I'm new to this as well. I was wondering what happens if you sell an option without actually buying it first? Do you then essentially owe whoever bought the contract 100 shares if they exercise the option?
Then DFV is a legend . . .  Well until someone shows their diamond hands on Tilray call options.
shares are my fav esp with bb
Energy and base metal stocks had a shitload of positive analyst activity today
Look at after hours rainbow bear.
Citigroup earnings. Should be good
I have 35 icln 40c 7/16 bought on Tuesday. Already down 13%. Hoping for a rally till then.
Yay up $5/share.  What’s your strategy for tomorrow or Monday?   When are you planning on selling?
Thanks babe. Now kiss me.
Maybe the US Govt can just buy some Gamestop or borrow it from some of you clowns here?
its always been like this but the fact that we're in a euphoric bull market basically makes it impossible to tell if something is a P&D or not, all looks the same lol
Solid as a diamond.
christ I saw that too.  I was up +$6k on $6k investing and I wanted to pull the trigger but I couldn't be a gay bear.  Now I'm down $432.
Yeah it’s up to you really.  I look at this as trying to maximize my gain with a simple strategy.  

I’m experimenting this year to help my sister and some friends who are investment noobs and very risk adverse.  I’ve been trying to get them more into options trading to grow their accounts (for lack of a better word, they’re essentially “poor”).  I’ve been having really good success with credit spreads and have been earning about 15% weekly on various trades I regularly do but it seems a bit over their head.  

Anyway I suggest rolling your weeklies and dumping the quarterlies.  The ones I picked are because of yield and calendar. 

HNDL is supposed to yield 7% yearly
KBWD is close to 10%
YYY also close to 10%

If any yields start dropping, I’ll look for something else to replace it for that fits the schedule
ATOM hitting 42.0 with it
apparently how? I've had positions since 2015.
Mother fucker exercised his calls to get another 10000 shares, absolute Chad King
They could have $55 calls for later this this year or even into 2023. Those would print fucking hard.
How can I profit off of companies doing diversity hires and Biden giving money to minority businesses?
I know it will go up and down so I'll hold for MOASS.
hmm im retarted, how does one borrow against a 401k? you go to a bank, show them how much you have in your 401k and they give you a loan for the amount?
I'm holding my 1/22s through the weekend. Let's go BB 🚀🚀🚀🅱️🅱️
AH yesterday was green today was red , so AH red today means we moon tomorrow
You should ride the wave you would still have 6-7 months out
Why are some people on here coming off like they're cowboys in the Wild Wild West? Like, my mind literally filled in you spitting into a jar after I finished reading you comment.
9c 1/15c, 9.5c 1/15

9c 1/22c, 9.5c 1/22

Yours?
Fuck off dude. DFV/RK is actually a great, wholesome guy. 

Inb4 you call me a DFV alt too.
No clue, but I will always buy Visa under 200.
That would be much more respectful to the untold millions who have had their financial lives ruined because of this.
got em.
That quote is often taken out of context - similar to what you are doing with Cuban. 

Buffet said "diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing."

don't forget my money
Lol. Then I'm an 18-year-old degenerate gambler investing my life into GME :-)
Investopedia should have the basics of an Ipo. It’s one of couple of ways a company has to go public. Like before yesterday, you couldn,t buy. AFRM stock
Why is bb up
> n my se

ahh ok that makes more sense, I took the more lotto play at 45/47 for 10$ so even if it's a sell the news it's w.e
Thanks 🙏🏼
are you still starting next week?
All you need boomers that joined today. Do not fuckin sell tomorrow
In principle yes, it would be his brokerage firm that does it & they could as long as he consents to it (usually implied in the contracts but Cohen can also withhold permission). Cohen can recall any lent shares at any time he wants them to but there's no added benefit to him doing so other than short squeeze, & I don't think he really cares too much about it in the first place
Please buy a Lambo and get it wrapped in the GameStop Logo
Brilliant
> Except their balance sheet and earnings are positive, 

Meme stocks aren't valued from these types of metrics anymore. 

> and they've had over 300% growth in e-commerce. 

Yeah, so has like every other online platform because of the pandemic + holiday spending feedback loops. It's not special or unique to gamestop, they're just one of the many boats that were lifted with the tide.
Same boat. Plus wrote calls for a 01/29 02/05 but holy hell they are holding their value for 26C, 26.5C, 28C. I'm bullish but I don't care if these fuckers sell on the way up

No idea but my guess is that people use a simpleton reasoning (as the majority of people here are doing) and think their market cap should equal chewy which is around 40b. At 18 price, woof was about 7b in mkt cap so a 100?
Before all of you with paper hands do what you do best understand that ICLN is an ETF. An ETF with stock worldwide. 30% is in the United States. Biden's Stimmy Bill isn't going to do much. People like me are shilling it because it's a good long term investment. Over a year. People here crying because it's not doing the same shit it did last week this week are the reason why it's shitting the bed. Get into QCLN if you want more American companies. Do super basic amount of DD and see what's actually in this ETF and you'll understand why when Biden announces green energy additions to the bill ICLN doesn't move much. I'm totally expecting it to tank once more tomorrow when people wake up to that idea. Like I'm genuinely embarrassed for the people crying all over this thread about it being a red week.
I like how the post is marked "Buyer Beware" 😂

It's good info though
LXRX 🚀🚀 LXRX 🚀🚀 TO VALHALLA!!!!!! HOP IN GUYS
BUY LXRX!!!!!
Pump n dump baby
lemme check 150 \* 169 = 25k ... hmm it will definitely be a one year retirement for me.
If GME doesn’t gap up again tomorrow morning theta is going on on me with no Vaseline
That yale thing.
Hey man, found the video... not sure Ive got 5 hours. Could you give me a estimate on when he starts talking about this subject? If you had to guess somewhere. Idk. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Already in IPOE, curious what is your timeframe for the  🚀🚀🚀🚀 ?
I see another +65 pip drop before that long taking control
up 100% past 8 days
I second this! 🤑
This is so true. It's also important to think about things from the perspective of large institutions or families with generational wealth. Risk doesn't really matter that much in your investments accounts that total like, $400,000. You'd look at risk a lot differently if you were dealing with money in the hundreds of millions or billions. Suddenly, even gambling that the United States will exist in 30 years will make you sweat.
I’d like to buy a vowel...”E”,.
Ding! One E on the board.

I’d like to solve, GME?!
Yeah, I swapped all my Feb 35c for Feb 30c and I'm much happier for it. They have low theta and high delta. Good gains will be made if ICLN goes up even 10%, and I would be able to hold even until expiry and still make money.
I don’t think I’ve ever since DASH pop up on their daily trade posts.
Same thing today. Bearish after hours, bullish before hours
To the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Agreed. I’ve been progressively loading Siri the past few weeks. I have 1130 shares (yeah, don’t give me shit about buying actual shares and not calls) at $6 cost now. Grossly undervalued, imo.
do you have data for this? That doesn't make sense to me because if that was the case theyd be paying a large premium to do so. In addition it would mean that shorts are buying calls.
lets go
I can’t enjoy this meme because this scene has me in my feels
Well maybe because it went from 43 to 65 in a matter of a couple weeks, broke 100 billion market cap, and is more expensive than tsla, which is saying something. Price targets are for a year projection, not end of the month. You are good, gotta roll with ups and downs. I'm long on nio, not hating on the stock,  just keeping it real
52 week high bro, Cramer's talking about a BBBY squeeze 🚀🚀🚀
Look at this guys first post on wsb... everyone was telling him how dump he was... look at him now 🥨😎
So is joining tomorrow a good idea?
Lol don’t say that. I just got out.
How do we know that they didn’t already buy them ?
There was a video of him licking crystal meth off of his friend’s hand and drinking beer while driving. 😬
7:15 normal person time
100% no
BB gang gang
I got Vanguard VTSAXX in mid October. First and only investment. Its $3000 to start but I am up like $300 so far. Not bad.
Yes!!  I’ve been loading up a ton of PLTR this week
Mine asked if I could teach her stocks.
Palantir moves when it wants to move >:(
The payments a bond makes is usually fixed. So if you pay less for it, you get a higher yield and vice versa.
Incorrect, gay rainbow bear
Biden better say some shit about GME those PS5 won't sell themselves
I too have that same position.  It’s already super tendie.  I can’t even imagine it at 30, would be a 5 close to 6 bagger for sure for me.
You could have just googled the definition.

In stock trading terms, it's something or someone that triggers a reaction to the stock and/or market. i.e. Jeff Bezos files for bankruptcy, Amazon shares down 99%. Elon Musk buys Amazon for $50 billion. Amazon stocks jump 100000% percent. Elon Musk buys Facebook for 1.5x it's valuation and DELETES IT! Facebook shares = $.000000000 delist. Elon Music now richest man in the galaxy worth 500000,0000000,00000000000,000000000 MEGA GAJILLION
Welcome
35k in BB TSLA F and GM......we'll see
Drop your sock and grab your cock when the rocket takes off..... there will be no shortage of buyers for those calls when liftoff occurs
I'm hesitating on buying on lol
Voltard?
I turned 1k into 10 grand in 11 months. This shit is completely retarded. Did I mention I have no idea what I’m doing?
I’m sorry I’m a complete retard and do NOT understand options. 

If you buy a ICLN 1/15 35c, if it expires do you just lose your money and nothing happens? Or do you have to buy the stocks?
Unbelievable
I didn't mean to but through my plays today I have ended up 84% in stock that can't be named and 9% in GME 2/5 44c down 20%.

Got rid of AAPL calls in the morning and timed some good BABA calls plays at the very end.

Oh and 12% Margin.
Yes.
Just picked up a Ford contract for Sept 2021, $17 break even. Thats on top of the 100 shares ive already purchased.  Get it while its still cheap. Up 10% this week!
Fuck I want to learn how to do this.
I love seeing the posts here about people going "stonk went down but my puts went down too wtf" cause it makes me realize that there really are way stupider people on here than me

Not by much, but it still helps
Mods shouldn’t have the ability to freely throw the flair.
$2 is a massive spike?
Dude everyone I talk to don't even know it went public. Watch tomorrow lol, Shits going to the moon.
Maybe you should test it out....the article is in the tech sub.
This is so helpful, thank you! Any suggestions on  YouTube videos or books I can read to learn more about strategy? For example, I assume large, mid, and small cap refers to market cap but I’m not sure what the pro’s and con’s are to each. I guess I’m looking for a place to learn beginner level vocabulary and strategy
The fuck is GM doing rn?
Thats just a recipe for the moon 🚀🚀🚀
Why you guys like DFV. The Jack off dude made 20k on CRSR
that is some very shitty photoshop
Deepfuckingvalue has to be Ryan Cohen. That's the only way to explain this. Has anyone ever seen Deepfuckingvalue and Ryan Cohen in the same room at the same time?? No they haven't.
TLDR sleeze ball Wall Street rats mad that they can't manipulate the market as fully without more effort.
Technicals haha
For reals though?
Reading is hard so I skipped to the bottom for a TL'DR saw rockets. YOLO confirmed
My retirement is all in your hands as of today, all in on BB
This has to be the trade of the year. Hell the trade of the decade. What realistically can beat this?
It’s up 100% in 2 days...when does the squeeze happen if not now?
Orbital Energy and BB! Already up 160 in 2 days on Orb and yolo-ing 1k into BB
If you are in the market congrats. Because we are going to be a bull market all year. Expect to see more news about beefcorn being used in shady deals. Dems will call to regulate beefcorn, pop the corn market and that wealth will have no where to go but options. Because let's be real, people playing the corn markets are even more of a degenerate then us.
DFV Hands gang checking in

Oh you’ll know
Is BB for real?

Very bullish but could work, godspeed
Post retirement, working part time on freelance commercial gigs and teaching a Continuing Ed class.  It’s just the right amount of involvement w people I like, and pays half-decently.
Took me five minutes DD to realize I want to stay away from this. As I commented on another TANH thread, I was unable to find anything regarding their EV offerings outside of press releases. 

i.e. a press release would tout how they have a new big customer contract to purchase x product from them, but I was unable to find any evidence of x product's existence via a simple google search. Literally took me just 5 minutes to see the red flags...
Lol
Are we rotating out of gme and into bb??

calls on water futures
Perfect time to buy though. Buy the dip.
Bought BB and more GME 10 minutes before close. Thinking of buying BBBY tomorrow, and retirement on Monday 🚀🚀

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven   
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
Lots of interest just before close so I'm hoping for the best.
How the fuck do you people think of these trades
I have to average down I bought a few weeks ago and it’s been bleeding. A long call is what I’m looking at tomorrow. I think they’ll have a good year. Reopening and stimmy
Just imagine if we somehow push GME to a trillion dollar market cap
Man, this may have been an error in judgement.  
Alternatively, 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Options, they are like turning your run of the mill stock market into a casino. Just as risky, just as rewarding/addicting

Biden has two speeches planned between now and the 22nd. I would hold for sure, if he mentions decriminalization or legalization they're going to go up again.

So you're locking up 6x the amount of money for a single month, making the same yield on something that would allow you to have 100% liquidity in 2 days.

omega yikes.
its not locked if you roth conversion ladder it
So many put and call contracts expiring tomorrow.  Either way it's going to be insane.
to invest in it.
I'm not one to believe that GME is going to even reach half of what VW did, but you are absolutely insane if you think GME is mostly retail traders. Absolutely bonkers that you think that's even possible.
Damn I bought Disney on the high side ($181). What's up with it going down?

BB is going to moon all year.
I haven't sold jack shit during this run up. I got a price target of 9 billion market cap. We're at what? 2.78b. For a company that makes 7b/year during the end of console cycle on top of a pandemic where 90% of their stores are closed.  With Cohen at the helm now? This should be trading at 3x rev like the other e-commerce. 18b price target. 

&#x200B;

 💎🙌🏻  💎🙌🏻  💎🙌🏻
He has said that, because he knows the average person will not put in the time, and research to know how to invest well. 

He preaches to the average person that just wants to live their life and put little thought into their investments.

Great investors know how to balance prudence, and aggression because they have confidence in their abilities that was hard earned.
Just don't be retarded.
Portfolio diversity 😏
If it's ITM, there will be a bid.
Yes, for a call that’s how it works. Whenever you’re going to be a contract Fidelity shows you the max loss, if you want to use them.
I'm on the fence with GME lol
Dude you haven’t made that money yet until you take it out and spend it... remember that.... otherwise it’s just numbers on screen
My retirement is all in your hands as of today, all in on BB
All I hear is 🛻📈
That’s irrelevant to the situation.
I didnt even know about this (Canacuck here)  you just ruined my whole fucking mood man. fuck off
I was up $260 on my 1 call 4 days ago.. now I’m down $70.... let’s hope shes shoots back up. May consider buying more calls if it dips any more

Gme next question
ahh I remember when my portfolio went +100% for the first time...took me about a week to wipe out all those gains and more

be careful and don't get cocky
Triple witching is the theory that something mysterious could happen and vol breaks and whatever.

This is mechanical ‘dealers gotta sell a shit ton of shares, the shares the bought yestersy and kind of today to run the price up’
Just buy the stuff 🚀
Pink pants has some great footwork.
Ooooooooooooooooooof
Right, but as someone trying to hedge a long position even if it gets swept I still make money based on how much it was liquidated for. If I buy 20 $39p and in the last 30 minutes GME tanks down to $20, even if my broker liquidates the position 5 minutes before close I'll still probably make more money than I would buying puts for next week.
? Did this post before you were finished? Cause if you're trying to make a point that I'm supposed to be understanding, you'll need more than one added word to convey it.
Be me find all the good buys at 1am, forget to pull trigger at open lose massive gains on multiple buys that I wished to procure.
The market represents all future earnings of the underlying securities.  With near-zero interest rates, and a vaccine on the horizon, the market is looking far past this temporary hurt.

I guess they are worthless because they are both negative. 1/15 MARA $27 C (-42%) and TLRY 17$ P (-20%) 1 contract each.
who is the user who posted his year in where he does his research, buys 1 stock only, and then moves on to the next one after it hits his target?  It was a year in post I think.
Bro people here were saying how “ARK was going to dump because it go up too much recently.”

Like motherfuckers here don’t even know what an ETF is.
I aged out the beginning of my senior year at 18.
That’s literally happened only once mate. It’s not as though it was some orchestrated effort.  What’s wrong with someone actually having read my DD saying it was good?
Im still in but didnt invest a lot. My dad has a ton but got in at ipo so he is sitting pretty just holding right now
LFG
You are
Yes
Just buy all of them 🚀🚀🚀
Are you sure just the opening of the options being available doesn’t count as “volume”
Gme has been losing money year after year.

Pltr posted profit last Q if you learn to read financial statement plus understand how direct listing works.

Snow has half pltr revenue and worth 2x its market cap with lower growth but it was an ipo 

Demo day for the first time in 2 weeks 

Earning in 3 weeks
fuck those cocksuckers for downgrading pltr
Disaster for the shorts
Lmao, I have my longterm investments account that's all boring and such and I have my margin account. 

I opened my margin account in February. I thought the market would go crazy because of the virus growing in China. Dropped a bunch of money in puts, but I lost most of it. Drop some more to make "sure" plays with calls, lost most of it. I decided to be safer in my gambles and go for the 🚀meme stocks, lost the rest of it. I'm back to my weekly contributions to boring, safe etfs.
Maybe, depends if you like paying for air to breathe by the gallon
You can choose to exercise and buy the stocks, but if you don’t it expires and you lose the premium you paid
literally American Psycho irl. incredible
no one tell him
What brooker do u use? I can’t buy it on my Brooker ?
I’m killing it with my Alph call
I guess they are worthless because they are both negative. 1/15 MARA $27 C (-42%) and TLRY 17$ P (-20%) 1 contract each.
Also an interesting thing to point out is that roughly 20% of the float is shorted. Not nearly as much short selling compared to $GME, but still noteworthy. I think it could even get squeezed before earnings, and maybe earnings will really make it fly. I think it should definitely be on WSB Watch list. Can someone get u/DeepF*ckingValue to do an analysis?
Wait I'm the one that gave gold. Give it back!
lmaoooooooooo thank you for this
No. $150
sure but wheres the fun in that?
You have to buy the stocks or get sent to Gitmo
.... like wait and buy a couple days before the earnings ?
$ZOM consolidation is just like $BGNO on Dec 28th, paired with a closed holiday for MLK day it’s the exact same kind of chart when BNGO rose from the $1 range and started this epic climb. 

[This Consolidation is nuts!](https://i.imgur.com/kZBsYGb.jpg)
so...... whys spy down, is it buydem's speech?
taking my gains to buy games on gamestop
All hail the King! 🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️
You magnificent bastard

I want a t-shirt with  “The squeeze has likely not yet squoze” on
So, correct me if I’m wrong, but it’s showing how much money I didn’t make by not selling now vs when I did?

Its good enough for George Soros lmao
Very true forgot about that, I dont doubt that Ryan and co has a plan in place for cloud gaming, what worries me is that Google is already leading and with the power necessary to fuel cloud gaming, I can only see Googles lead becoming even bigger in the future. Its a project perfect for Google, I know the meme is Google kills off all their projects but 90% of the time its things that either eat into some of their more successful projects or something that could easily be repurposed and added as a feature in another project. Stadia fits neither
500 shares at 7ish. It it til it literally sinks.
BB bro!
Omg GME finished
Just sent a GTC for 3 shares
Would a put not increase if the stock price decreases?
yah from now on, im thinking about just holding until a PT of $50 or $70
From what I gather they're out of the phone business and into cyber security big time now. Relative to comparable cyber security firms they are way undervalued. DYOR tho
Down 51.85% but who gives a shit 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🐂📈
ICLN pleas fly again.
Large bid ask spread. Doesn't mean that anyone will actually pay that for it.
1 @ $21
4 @ $32

Not only am I doing my part... I’m doing it poorly!
DFV is a chad and a man of kindness, he will open a charity fund to handle all the money he got from these gains down in Texas.
Doubt we get above $100 on this quick upswing. Maybe we touch it briefly but then drop to $90 over the next week. If you are buying at least a month out I’d feel good about it
yeah, sure, but when?
I feel like since everybody is expecting GME to go up it’s gonna hit us with a pump fake.
Watch JPM!!! Might be a big ass winner depending on earnings
Because you believe 🙏
Remember when GME dropped to a mere +6% this morning and some of yall thought it was over 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
I sold 1/15 BB 9c this morning

You're welcome
Bruh did you forget what subreddit you're in? You're surprised at people's stupidity here, and *you're* the one that's embarrassed?
At $9.45 now
fing amazing how people keep buying this shitt when it's been proven and proven again to burn you
I'm long AF. But you've gotta hedge especially when signs point to a sell off tomorrow.
I guess they are worthless because they are both negative. 1/15 MARA $27 C (-42%) and TLRY 17$ P (-20%) 1 contract each.
Good point. Bump it up to 75% per day.
Ironic. Company that used to make phones for boomers is getting saved by retarded zoomers
Just made $370USD from this post. Ty 👌
I got 1/29 55$ but just one. I GUARANTEE these autists bought 55Calls for tomorrow.
Bought 100 shares of BB today and I will buy more tomorrow morning 🚀🚀🚀
I lovw the first comment. Someone roast that douche hahaha
I appreciate your post. Thanks for informing us, amigo!
There's a stellar one in Minnesota called X2 as well.
So is BB the new meme stock?
Yep tomorrow is probably going to be rough. Out of interest when did you buy those puts? Was it after this massive rally?
I don't think that applies to individual investors
I bought mara/riot puts eod. How am i looking
Why the fuck doesn’t chewie get a medal? I always hated that
This ain’t the squeeze yet, buckle up we’re just preparing for launch. This is just the beginning.
Well done!
Lol I know wtf Batman vs riddler over there. Spit it out brother! What does Tesla do on Friday’s? I’ve seen it moon and sell off on Friday’s. Tesla is always shorted so quit the chinese finger trap stuff
They used to call the governor of CA (Jerry Brown) Moonbeam and I just thought it was so appropriate
BBBY squeeze has begun. 60% shorts but most of the shares are long term holds.

Expires worthless and lose money
Help , how
It just expires worthless at that point
LUMN is dogshit. CenturyLink couldn’t get their stock moving by sitting on their hands and hoping their outdated fiber network would hold so they renamed themselves.
My RKT calls I bought yesterday are up 84% today, this is the play.
Did you get it from here: [https://twitter.com/CopalCapital/status/1349816615097884672/photo/1](https://twitter.com/CopalCapital/status/1349816615097884672/photo/1)
What the fuck are you talking about?
PLTR $29 by 2/5 or im I fucked?
Bulls make money, pigs make money, bears get slaughtered!
I am in India. 9:30 hours ahead. F1 student who came here in May. I know nothing of India and have a business in the US so more comfortable trading there
What’s the play?
If you wanna be the coolest person in the room, that’s fine. I’m here to buy my bitches happy meals in an F150.
so why is BB the next meme stock?
If you want to make it in this game, anytime you take a profit it's a good thing. Sure could you have made more? Yes, but if you had that sort of insight you'd be able to print infinite money. So just be glad you made money and not lost it friend.
Too early to tell
Can someone explain this call to me? Started trading yesterday and my platform doesn’t do calls (I’ll move when there’s a decent one in the UK)
Icln goes up for months straight then once it gets commented in here a ton it stays completely flat all week 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
thank you u/pachocabrera
Anyone gonna buy this Amazon dip 

Especiallly under 3100 ??
We're in the same boat. How could I not sell CCs with 600% IV.
Why do you think so?
Just now getting to 2019 levels. With streaming blowing up the way it has we have potential for $75+  totally correct though, should have posted before. Too many people were jerking off to PLTR and GME to notice. Myself included
Best suggestion is to have an exit plan. Sell XX% shares at XX% gains. For instance you have 100 shares, set an exit price for 20 of them, than a higher exit price for 40, than an unreasonably high price for 20 and an unspeakable price for the reaming 20... Values depend on your risk tolerance... Stick to the plan! Good luck man! See you on the battlefield tomorrow!
ITM, most brokers will try to sell your contract before the end of market 

OTM, contract expires worthless
who long you gonna try to pump them?
Why are some tickers banned?
do you think ZM is a buy now?
God damn this movie is so good. Watched it for only the 2nd time the other night when I couldn't sleep and I think it's a top 5 movie for me
I am holding all GME and taking the extra money I'm getting from BNGO into my personal cash use and to reinvest back into BNGO. I'm essentially financially independent  today and I'm so fucking blessed.
BB turn around story.  Software, Cybersercurity, AI, Self-Driving, enterprise secure phones.  BB under valued at 5billion
Good job retard. First one's free
This isn’t manipulation. It’s public, everyone can see it, people can buy or not buy.
so that would be even better for all of us i’m assuming.
Same cept this morning... Already up 13%
if it below 35 it expires u lose all the money you paid
xd
Dave Ramsey dat you?
Yeah it was a surprise, probably glossed it over when the law came about and never thought about it since. Too bad I didn't ask about it in my offer, oh well time to pay the tax man
It’s literal serendipity most times, in this case he grabbed an OTM contract right before a squeeze.
Thanks for making me feel important too. Meanwhile, I will continue to live vicariously through the big dawgs
Can we pump bb to 20 shit is prime
69.420
if deepfuckingvalue is in, count me in
Bought at 18 sold at 19 so the guy who bought it at 19 could sell it for 20. It's called passing the buck and it's what makes WSB so great.
Yup, that’s the fucking ballz play.
I’ll buy your  option comrade. I will make sure to save enough just for you.
I thought it was Order 66?
Worth it just going all in on IPOE shares or am I really missing out by not buying calls.

Help me fathers - may the tendies be with you. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I sell covered calls through Vanguard every week.  Vanguard is a perfectly cromulent broker for that kind of trade.
What’s a good call to make on $BB for tomorrow? Seriously no idea what I’m doing.
Btw how did you know to look so early? Trying to find smart plays like this rather than getting in for .84 cents and stuff
Tech stonks got scared. Small peepee
Wait, what? I have karma?
Low volume draw down with extremely large buying at close. Looks like ATHs next month or even an opex ramp tomorrow. Should be fun!
She is probably better than most of the retards here who only understand Robinhood and never touched thinkorswim
I did the same shit yesterday. Bought again today, went red and I told myself this time I'm riding it into the ground. Fuck it.
2k shares :)
You son of a bitch, I'm in.
If closes at $35 or higher you buy the 100 shares at $35. If closes under you have nothing.
$BB was at $8.07 when I commented on this. 8.5c 1/15 went from $0.20 -> $0.80.
Budget porno would have better more gains.
I'm betting on a sea of good news coming out AH Friday so hype can permeate through the long weekend.
If it expires the police come and get you. Dont let that happen
Not on Fidelity, you have to sign up for the program.  Fidelity doesn't even let me set a limit that far away from the price its messed up.
Squoze
Thanks for the work you put in. Amazing that Soros has a piece of it. Just hope he won't dump it quick like he did Palantir...
I had emails I wasn’t sure were best to share publicly at the time. Plus, I couldn’t figure out to remove the permission requirement on my Google Doc.  XD
Bought calls from the insider training dd week of Christmas. Sold all for a loss except the 10$ contracts. Up 1k today lol. Was going to let it go to zero because it was at .04 any ways.
Need PLTR to moon, sheetco*n and CCIV... am I fcked?
He has a really good 4 minute video that gives his reasonings.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4
Yes that is exactly what I think aswell, however the price just went to fucking 245. Clearly shows a lot of panic. And everyone hates FB.
BB will become so big it will buy AMZN in 5 years
Correct
those calls were green a long time ago
if it’s out of the money it’s worthless, if it expires in the money you can exercise
Let's just go all in. It's that easy  🚀🚀🚀
we'll see. still super jacked up here with rsi at 83. i think you'd like to see a 70s rsi and a 10-20% correct before getting in again

this thing and FCEL basically doubled in a week remember, and it's not like they were coming off lows.
yuck!

I mean fruit and salmon?! I can't
do I think that gambling is a better strategy than investing? no
Blackberry and Gamestock making people money? What is this 2005?
SIRI gang reporting.
how did your aerospace position do today? i remember you were building a position into that a month ago.
Thanks for the tip. Bought 5 BB 02/05/2021 9.50 C. Already over 9.50 AH!
too much logic and not enough gme 

to the gulag you go
What will be next year? 🤔
What app or site is that?
I don't know what to do with such profitable calls. Probably hold until '22
*95%
well it is true. i'm not a millionaire as I didn't play this stock. I have money set aside to add to current positions. I would maybe spend $5k on this gamble, but I'd rather take safer plays. I made some money on Disney+ but again, I try to minimize risk and rarely bet more than 1-2% of my portfolio.  
I realize you are trying to be a dick about this, but I provided you with information, take it as you will. don't get all butthurt you missed out on making money loser. also there's a whole bunch of millionaires now just go look on the main page retard.
Yikes lol I hope ur right cuz it doesn't look like it rn
I don't know, they keep calling me to sign up, the service basically doesnt work in my city, and doesn't work in the surrounding mountains including at my home. I just tell them if they can make it as consistent as AM radio ill consider using it for free.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Bling Bling 💎💎
I only have 2 stocks @19 but a about 200 bucks just sitting in my account doing nothing. Do I buy more 🤭🤔
So it's essentially a buy the position and hold until the price gets high enough that people start selling more then people are buying, which causes the price to fall back down?
A week ago I had 50K

Thanks to gme I now have 82k to play around with
Tsla AH news wow
Thanks. Didnt know that.
From yahoo:

Volume: 83k 
Open interest: 27k

Quite a bit.
Got like 20 calls been dying the past month earnings in feb and fell with the news of banning trump on Twitter and snap no other bad news don’t see why it wouldn’t go back up I’m holding no matter what
Buy now in after hours. It’ll be cheaper than at open!
People saying this are dumb.

1) Pelosi is balls deep in big tech.
2) Big tech is silencing the right. The left is in control...
Dr. Patel level analysis right here
9000 shares. The new broncos and electric mustangs are apparently exciting.
Yahoo finance does this with options for some reason, you’ll be fine.
you ugly
But...but...I just got my account green .. lol
I saw rockets on the post
They just went up after they released their earnings so I would personally wait for a dip which is expected in the near future, but that’s just me.
Before they get IV crushed?

They are born in the crusher lol.

You should do well on a good day though.
Do you have funds to buy one more share tomorrow? Do it! I’m gonna buy one more share we should all spread the word to buy one more share
still good at money shit
Well so far this hasn’t been a fools errand so that’s nice!
I'd hold till April at least, they've still got alot of growth potential with the amazon deal and as cyber security company which is becoming a massive industry.
Odds of lucid actually happening?
Buy PLTR like always
B FUCKING B
they also die

how does TSLA fit into this?
Thank you! Put it 4K and jumped in the 🚀🚀🚀
Yeah interesting movement today
>easily. It is already 4% on AH
F gang 🤝 BB gang
I cant believe you are all posting about +20 cents AH. Kind of sad.
maybe you didn't see that it went up 100% in two days
-.74 u mean
We are/were in a similar situation (minus the SS because we're not required to contribute due to our pensions) but we just continue/d to max out our pre-tax space, then Roth, then taxable.
Yes, if you are buying the option, not writing it
No. Momentum trading has slightly outperformed for the past few decades. Unfortunately, the WSB version involves too much emotion to not blow up your account most of the time.
Interesting, I hadn’t thought of that. Hopefully demand for EV increases as things get back to normal in the coming years
So is next week a sell the news week? 😴Joe stimmy leaked and inauguration next week. Likely late next week market moons on earning anticipation?

Definitely hold until tomorrow
Fuck you. And congrats.
Bitch, why are you lying?
You just lose your money, unless you want to exercise them at 35.
I’m in , on market beat , they have awesome ratings , forsure a 100-200%  profit min . Also , it’s on Robinhood , which many pennys are not , so those kids that really need fast cash (meaning they withdrawl , which I don’t want them to do , but I understand )
What if this is Ryan Cohen?
Not a single WOOF , you guys don't like money
Raise corn, rear a child.
ARKQ AH 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Most you can lose is the price you paid for that optiob
>I am interested to hear if anyone was counting on this in the later years

At least from what I remember from the fantastic ERN series, most retirement "failures" are due to a sequence of returns risk in the first few years of retirement. Therefore, SS doesn't really factor in for me because it starts too late to make a difference in most failure cases.

It might make more of one for someone retiring early but not *super* early, like at 55.
How does theta eat shares?
what happened?
I'm having an urge to restart my Netflix membership. Is there anything new that's good? Is this bullish for NFLX? Probably not. They're getting hit left and right with competition, but I don't even bother looking at other streaming services. So.. bullish?
Underrated af, Software, Cyber Security, Talks with car companies, long standing history etc
Wowowo tha fuck is that Put doing down there🤮
If you say you are retired but still work, the FIRE police will come and take you away no matter how leisurely your hustle.
You’re doing it wrong
Buy puts I dare you
The new hybrid F150 is unironically kinda dope
Soooo.... does this mean I should have sold my 1/15's today?

Does it also mean I shouldn't have bought more 1/15's today as well?
What is this “if”
Ryan Cohen leapfrogging Elon
Dad?
They're about to get a lot cheaper soon
I bailed on SPG and BPY. Both saw a jump when the deal to rescue JCPenney was announced, but shopping malls are never recovering. What the internet first did to newspapers, it's in the process of doing to shopping malls. 

There will always be in-person shopping, but in order for retailers to survive, they're going to need to completely rethink their strategy and footprint. That's bad news for SPG and other REITs that have steep exposure to shopping malls.
Don’t worry no chance of me getting cocky as it’s constant fear lmao. Non of my friends are into investing so can’t tell anyone as they’ll think I’m nuts.
What if u/deepfuckingvalue is Cramer
Which further proves that AAPL are mostly invested by boomers who only read charts and do fundamentals, stock market now runs on news and not value.
$69 by 4/20
by market close of 1/15, if icln isn't above 35, it expires and your money disappears, nothing happens. if it's over 35, you can buy 100 shares per contract for $35
BuT BiTcOiN Is AnOnYmOuS!
if they buy calls they will cause a stock runup. I don't think the shorts are buying calls except potentially extremely otm calls but those were added literally today. So this would be a new development
You regret taking your initial investment out?
Bought $SPCE at close, so now it's collapsing. 

Sell at open if it stays red??   hmmmmm.
Wow I was feeling like crap all week and this cheered me up a little lmao
Yoooo, I remember reading your comment and thinking that was impossible. 17.50 here 💎🙌
Awesome man! Let me know how you do in the future. Since you stsrted to perform better in the last months I wonder how it will go in the next
Time to get back in lol
Oh shit, down for 2 days straight?
What is this in reference to?
Doesnt matter if he invests it right away or in 2 weeks imo, if its still before the next ex-dividend date, he will get paid regardless
Weeklies tear me apart but I love them. What else would I do all day!?

Didn't you see them at CES?
So... Jeff Amazon. We just gonna slide around and not do shit?

Is this because your EX selling the shit outta the stock? What gives?
Approximately 25m, if we literally diamond hands them, would mean an infinity squeeze.

The problem is, shorts can hold on as long as they can keep adding to margin and paying borrow fees.  So the price would just slowly tick up forever.

Or at least a squeeze until GME issued new stock or until even Cohen was enticed out.
Thank you bro. Trying to get in touch with mods to remove the flair. 🙌🏻
I don’t think $4, but I think there’s an honest case for $2.  Whether or not we get there, I’m not sure, but I think there’s a case for it.
Nice thanks ur right its cheap. Will try to buy tomorrow
Buy some puts man!!
All of us
If Tesla can hit 860+ tomorrow I will survive
we wouldn't even be lying.
Hell I sold at 27% and got in at 21% (38.10) again. Lucky play

no that's the stock ticker. The name of the company
Yeah, but the risk is if it trades sideways for even a day or 2 your profit will get eaten up. If it keeps going up like this you’re set, but sideways = iv crush.
Probably some dude named Arnold on that board that sold his shit at $3 crying his eyes out
Holy fuck 😭

Stocks only go up though
GME is just crushing it. I read somewhere that it's expected to hit $100.... I cant imagine.
Confirm my bias daddy 🥴
When we are well in the triple digits.
Congratulations dude holy shit, been looking at this all day.
What TSLA leaps should I get?
Only after the squeeze is over.
I don't touch China, and I'm half Chinese

Gotcha.  Thanks again.

What’s the news? The Austin Texas news?
Traumatised from GNUS, you are :)
BB and Orbital Energy. Orb is a bit slower though
Ahh, makes sense. So tell us what happens tomorrow since you are already there.

And is that in USD??
but actually BB will stabilize at $20 this year with some upside above that

Lol you must have bought mine
Anxious before big news probably yeah
I have opened a high end goods store with the amount of bags I am currently holding. Modern problems require modern solutions.
So can we talk about c-c-I—-v yet or is it still taboo and ban worthy?
I think to late for BB. But sure WSB will come ip soon with another squeeze as this seems to work. 

I'll do the same. MSFT is fucking disappointing
Like feb-19 115$?
What's your course of action if you're holding covered calls that have gone WAY past the strike price and are nearing assignment, but you still believe in the stock and it's growth potential.  Roll Up & Out and hope they expire on the next cycle?  Allow them to be assigned then buy back in? Hedge with purchase of additional calls? Curious what the room thinks, though I may regret my curiosity too knowing this bunch.
turns out I'm just dumb and my mutual funds went up 23% in 2020. I haven't done much stock trading yet but I don't know if I would be able to beat that return on my own?
I have never seen anything like this GME shit. Wild
Yes, I do lol
F. Yes. A play I can get behind.
Who else went all in on snap today?
My bad! I assumed you were looking at them. Great move 😂 🚀🚀🚀 Also read your Double D's on the Double B's and YOU SON OF A BEACH IM IN. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Join the waiting game bro sooner or later they will go north. Never sell on a lose.
if you're interested in index funds, I highly recommend Bogle's work, he makes a pretty good case for investing in index funds for the risk-averse investor.
For real this is why the stock market will continue up. The power of the get rich dream is unmatched. Now we all have the opportunity. We don't need to start a company and grind or come up with some awesome idea. We just have to buy and sell the right shit at the right time. And it can happen in a matter of days. Everyone who is getting into the market will stay here. When they lose it all they will come back and bring friends with them. There will be more traders than ever before. This is only the beginning. This isn't a bubble like days past, this is a movement.
TD Ameritrade or Schwab.
4,000 bought today. Fuck it
I’ll always remember the GameStop employee laughing in my face when I asked why there were barely any GameCube games. THANK YOU DFV for getting the last laugh. Fuck GameStop
I hear you. I’m in the U.K. so don’t really fuck with options which is probably saving me money atm.

Serious q: I have just over 60 shares, planning to buy more on any dip (there will be a selloff at some point) and get to 100 shares, then sell a covered call. What date and price will make me max profit and lowest risk of my shares being called away? (I’ve never sold a covered call before)
Decimal place error *$694.20
Not only that, but there are pumpers who make posts like "TNXP IS GOING TO FLY TOMORROW!" and then delete their post when it tanks instead. There should be a hall of shame for clowns like that.
Anyone else pick up 0dte lean hog calls at close?
If that’s the case, can I be a mod?

RIP Charlie Murphy
What makes you think that will happen tomorrow when it didn't happen today after it leaped to 42?  I thought we were headed to the moon then and then the bitch just went into orbit and hung out killing my boner and just leaving me with wet underwear.
Have some GME 4/16 $26C, how long do I ride? Bought at $5 each. 

Dont worry, have 100 shares too. Might load up more.
No. RKT doesn't pump at all, PLTR at least gives you swings.
Is Microstrategy the next NIO?
everyone
As expected. But GME is on moon mission so ya never know
😨
45c and 50c for tmrw =)
What's the news?
Even if earnings are bad, I bet his guidance will be good enough to make people hit the green button just to squeeze the bears. That's how this thing works.
AMZN is killing me, how can a stock be so shit
Get above 850 Tesla NOW
I’m already sick of the meme stock, thank you.
I was tuned out for the day. Did the market tank on the cheaper stimmy payment news? (yes I said stimmy)
Add shares to upgrade to Cadillac seats
BB TO THE FUCKING MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌝🌝🌝🌝
Paper hands?  I call that riding with house money.  I tend to do that when my stock reaches 2.5+  I like to sell enough to get my money back (EG 3x I sell 33% to cover) then ride on house money for the rest gives me more options
jfc the screeching today
Ya I’m looking into things now, thanks for the heads up
See above
I'm buying 2000 shares. You retards made me do this.
B fucking B
**Market:**	ESH21

**Date:**	14-Jan

**Attempted Direction:**	Down

**Rotation Factor:**	-12

**Range Extension:**	Seller

**Tails:**	Buyer

**Buying/Selling Composite:**	Selling comp

**One-timeframing (D/W/M):**	Day: OTing up, Week: Inside bar (Non trend), Month: OTing up

**Comments:**	"Thursday opened above value, but within range following a below-average volume ON session with just 13.5 points of range. The open type today was an open-auction, very little activity from buyers or sellers as the first 9 periods (A-J) traded through the open at some point in a similarly tight range compared to the ON session (13 points).

Buyers had a slight edge early in B period as they continued the daily one timeframing higher, but price was unable to reach the base of the buying spike on 1/8 (3816.5), indicating that that buyers weren't strong enough to overcome the responsive selling and were getting long at bad prices. Lower highs and lows were seen following B period as sellers slowly took control, they weren't able to find much continuation, however, until K period. 

A liquidation break began when K period took out the G period low and continued into the close, leaving a few single prints in L period as price headed back towards  the comp HVN at 3795 and resulting in a selling spike (spike base = 3803) within the short-term balance area of the last 6 sessions (including today)."

**Daily Volume:**	1.13m (lower)

**Volume Average (20):**	1.28m

**VA Placement (H/OL-H/L/OL-L/Unch):**	OL-Higher

**VA Width (Wide/Avg/Narrow):**	Average

**Directional Performance Relationship:**	Balancing, Strengthening

**Comments:**	Volume before the afternoon liquidation was well below average and acted to shutoff buying activity. When activity in one direction is not being effectively facilitated, price will move accordingly to begin increasing activity again, which in this case meant price moving down. Due to the lateness of the liquidation in the session, the dVPOC (3809) and dVA remained higher, but overlapping relative to yesterday.

**Tomorrow's Expectation:**	"Although we did see acceptance of higher prices today prior to the liquidation break, the selling acted as a rejection of these higher prices as we reverted back to previously established value below us at the comp HVN. This puts the market back into a neutral state where participants can conduct business at mutually accepted prices.

The gameplan within this short-term balance area remains unchanged at the moment, selling above balance VAH (3808.25) and buying below balance VAL (3787.5) provide good day timeframe opportunities targeting balance VPOC (3795).

Until we begin to see increased activity at/near the balance extremes, this range will continue to be traded. If one of the balance extremes is traded, I would caution placing trades in the direction of the possible breakout until there is confirmation that the breakout is valid. A false breakout and reversal seems to be the more likely scenario, IMO, especially to the downside (with reversal higher)."
Bought 4 of them at .30
You are out of your fucking mind and I love it.
HODORing GME shares and calls for poots expiring tomorrow 🌈 🐻  r fuk. 🚀 🚀 🚀
Not sure, perhaps someone less retarded than me can answer that question. I suspect dropping ~$200,000,000 on the stock would have a very noticeable effect though.
Yeah, I agree . I’m thinking it was just the trump news . Snap has been a solid play for a while .. will probably buy more tomorrow if it’s red at all.. you know earnings gonna kill again.. and didn’t it shoot up like $10 after earnings last time ??
hmmm maybe not then. i wonder why its going up?
New here. Why a $7 call when it's at 9~ currently unless you expect it to go down? Eli5?
Upvote if you dislike malarky
im in and also have anxiety!
have you considered just doing the opposite of your impulses?
keep on keeping on
I never took it off gas dammit.... I never took it off. 🚀
What time is biden speaking?
Finished?
Buy after hours if you can
The word out with that initial $15 breakout was that the console manufacturers needed the retail presence across country.

Big box isn't a substitute.

It's in their interests to have a national retailer that is everywhere selling physical games.
up 12.9% on my main account today. im questioning my feb UNG calls.
holding the line. not gonna sell till we hit some real numbers.
Is this real?
Fellow serving here GME making more than my wages🚀

No shit he sold those they expire tommorow.  This is going to rise for a while, well past next week.
Link, I don't see anything
May dip after the boom from the Carol Baskin comment however HOLD cause Truforma comes out March 30th.
That's the spirit
I never said I'm surprised by the stupidity, I'm just geniuenly surprised that it's gotten this bad. It's so obvious that Tik Tok investors are becoming too influential.
First Cramer, then the Wall Street Journal. Can't deny the power of collective autism.
They are in the cyber security and os game now.
One contract at 12.5c 1/22. Planning on getting a few more at same price. :D
I bought at 16.20
Buy calls on Family Video
It's fucking hilarious reading through the comments in the post that started it all

> This dude should sell now

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1g7x0/hey_burry_thanks_a_lot_for_jacking_up_my_cost/
I bought at $1.20. I’ve been making rediculous moves in the market all day I almost forgot that was one. So far I’ve only lost a cup of coffee
Most probably both :(
I didn't know better bought on closed markets over new years got the 16€ high in the 04.01. which minutes later dropped and stayed around 14€. Gotta love that DD that pushed me to buy
This is the way

What are you looking for specifically in his videos? The Christmas update one was just a quick 3 minute video, it wasn’t a livestream.  

Usually his livestream videos have an intro and disclaimer page for the first 3-4 mins.  Then he hops on and takes a few sips of beer and gives an overall recap of recent events for the next 10-15 mins. He’ll have a few tabs open on his screen, each with a different topic about GME.  Will spend a couple mins discussing each of them.  

After that, it’s about 4-5 more hours of talking to people through the Live Chat, answering questions, discussing everything GameStop, and just chillin out and drinking.  

Full disclosure: I have not watched the full 5 hours of any of his live stream videos.  But I’ve watched 1-2 hours of a few of them.
Just stay off of Stocktwits. This is my only warning.
Got me some Goldman
same hahah


After stimmy pack it should moon in coming days
Haha yes
IBKR is what I use
Who shorted FB/Twitter/WhatsApp/Instagram?
What’s the price to get out? I’m in at 9.50 , one for the WSB
I'm a night worker who bought GME at 39, do I need to be up early tomorrow for this
🙏
Does anyone know how the conference  went for them ?!
I’m up 60% as of today. Pretty happy with the investment despite my concerns about jumping in at IPO! And it’s definitely an ethical investment for me as well. No matter what happens vertical farming will be a part of humanity’s future.
Ughhhhh
i bought some calls the other day. they went up 300%. Zoom boutta break through resistance level of 385$, they also have an announcement tmr that they are making, and ARK just bought tons of zoom shares. I am holding 1/29 calls and holding until then. Possible S&P incluision too so lots of things looking good for ZM.
$550 tomorrow
The economic recession probably didn’t help

Fuck you i work at an investment bank wanted to go in on GME on December 27th but Compliance didn't allow since I'm working in the tech coverage team rn

Lose money twice as fast
I was tracking the option volume on the 40$ calls throughout the day (a chart would be nice)

This is the way they escape the short squeeze. Their calls are not excercised on the floor thus avoiding increasing the price and they return them to the lender. Yes they pay a premium but that’s the cost of doing business.
I lost almost $200 on it this morning.
Indeed, when buying options, whether they are calls or puts, max loss is limited to premium paid.

Selling options is where the loss can greatly exceed initial investment. When selling naked calls specifically, the potential loss is theoretically infinite.
They know it's a PnD.
make it 1000 atleast pussy
Man, the inconsistent number of decimal places is surprisingly annoying. Thanks for the data, though.
Wait that's him??? My goodness he talks fast. Big 1000 IQ brain in there.
Nflx has good talent and good shit, long term boomer hold
BB is primed and loaded
Still you but well done
NOK the worst company... There is so much better opportunities than NOK
i hope so dude! i put in 170 shares and 4 45c jan/2022
Any $BIGC call holders? I’ve got 2/21 95 calls.
If you want to contribute to the squeeze, buy shares! (or a mix of shares and options). Also wtf you playing the weekly games for?? It's not like you're going to lose that much upside playing monthly/quarterly and you won't be helping those bastard institutions keep afloat
You son of a bitch I'm In
Options are contracts you pay premium to purchase shares on a given day. Therefore, if it’s below 35 you’ll definitely have got IV crushed before 1/7 and risk goes up. If it’s above you’ll be allowed to grab the shares at the set price 35. Robinhood won’t execute if you don’t have the capital to get those shares
I’d fuck with that for sure
Absolutely not.
not it
Wow good? Wow bad?
Have been for awhile. 

They usually stay hidden in the dark corners, too afraid to show themselves amongst the teen hormones pervading this place.
Dam bb why you going limp
Ehm ok, so rocket or poop emoji?
Yeah, I think it’s interesting to see all the moves today from the everyone trying to front run each other trying to front run her, lol
until it stops printing
Ok then
Imagine anyone other than DFV trying to claim they’re the GME Oracle.
You better believe it
Question: Will this help shorts cover and may cause a significant shake up tomorrow as the other options contracts expire?
Glad I dumped BABA to get in on GME!! Thank you Guys!!
There's this underground company called tesla. You should look into it
This is a Roth IRA. No tax

Bought GME 40c expiring tomorrow for $285. Am i fucked or will i be feasting bois? Any money i make from it will be used to buy shares
THANK YOU JIM CRAMER "Don't sell Tesla stock"
I’m thinking their only move for growth is to buy DTV from T. Curious if the recent movement is based on a coming announcement.
This is why we are here
Saying all that, I guess the wildcard though is American shale and how much they will ramp up production. Ideally covid would have bankrupted some and maybe led to some consolidation but it doesn’t seem like much happened
nah. BB has large short interest as well.
how?
It’s like he’s a fucking time traveler. Bought at the bottom calls that expire at the absolute top (more than likely). If there has ever been a case for a time machine, this dude has it.
Please make pltr shorts squeal like gme shorts
Why would it be delisted after an investor invested 40m as a direct offering. Don't believe everything you read unless you have sources
You fucked up A A ron

Yet again, we've made news headlines. This is where normies hop on board and pump our magnum opus to high high heaven.
True but I wonder what the reason behind is though. So far TSM has been having all record breaking news leading up to the earning.
:rocket:

They provide materials and production equipment for cannabis cultivation. Market cap at time of dd was 19m, there is little to no news and light being shed on the fact they signed their largest contract recently...https://surna.com/investor-relations/

Isn’t inauguration bullish 

Like when he was elected
Play is the same as always.

Hold ICLN, MSOS, and QQQJ
Huge text wall but nothing about Internet Gold?
how?
Look I'm glad everyone has made tendies on these small and micaps, but IWM is so overbought it's unreal. Straight line up for like three months. It may go to $120 but sooner or later (and prob sooner rather than later) it is gonna tank HARD
what news?
And then?
Can anyone loan me some money trying to buy 1 share of GME now that its at 40$
Same. I Yolod my entire down payment 45 mins ago. If this doesn't shit the bed, I'll be set
This happened with GRWG and I let them be assigned and then it took off past any point I could afford to keep selling options on it
Anyone not in GME and in cloudflare?
When do we get an update on the short interest
Any one of us would’ve done the exact same thing at that point, let’s not kid ourselves. Even if we knew beyond the shadow of a doubt this was going $100+. The dude did nothing wrong here.

I still see 50,000 shares and even more $ in calls still in the game which obviously wouldn’t be if he thought this wasn’t going to continue rocketing.
It's not the next meme stock, it's just pumped by Discord groups. BB sold 90 patents to Huawei.
Fuck me 😭
Well, you’re not completely out of the game yet, IV is keeping your calls alive for MARA - and TLRY still has about $20 of value.  You can sell them at open and take the PDT hit, or hope for the best and stocks moving in your direction.
Lol, Im still holding those PayPal stocks BTW- Cha Ching
No I put it before the market closed by just seeing the hype!
What is wsb? I see people reference it a lot.
Didn't read, but will fight to the death for it.
how do you lose half a milly and laugh it off?! I don't even have anywhere close to that much to lose lol
Holding BBBY strike $30 calls that expire tomorrow
Seconded. I came to make the same recommendation on the Swedroe book.

Been in on Jan 23 $10 BB calls. Bout time you retards stopped sleeping on it.
I had a well-balanced portfolio making tiny gains over 2 years. Within a month of reading wallstreetbets I had yoloed my entire net worth into gme.
There’s no way lol
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice BB 🚀🚀🚀🌕
Stop jerking, i already came ... twice .. within 3 sec
I subscribe to 50 cent’s investment goals.

Get rich or die trying.
MM need to be aware that wsb will buy the GME shares that they’re desperately trying to get. Doesn’t matter if they downgrade GME, we want a short squeeze! 😝
Shoot im holding until next month!
Damn dude no need for bribes
You bought to open. 

So sell to close brudda 

Or hold until it expires worthless..
Strike/date?
but if everyone just buys options how will we sqeeze
More like r/joketbatwentovermyhead
It would definitely be stupid to move my entire $1.3k baby account into GME tomorrow at open, right? Right??
I'm just doing this for adrenaline with 1 contract and its a wild ride lol. Let's hope I dont lose it all tomorrow before expiry! GME to 47+
I’m re-holding like the retard I am
Don’t worry. After Biden speech, we gonna hit +10% tomorrow. He gonna keep pumping the shit
I think it’s at 1:15pm ET. It’s their Annual Virtual Growth Conference.

social-media traders? Such a degrading term, this outs us in the same hat as fucking tiktok, instagram and who knows what else.

We are autists, retards and fammots. Not social media traders
But options fun
No fap until $50
A new breed of traders with instant access and a drive to re-engineer reality.
Crazy to see that 65% of his gains are still unrealized.
No we should all buy GME tomorrow. It's your duty as a retard to follow papa Cohen into battle and eradicate Melvin.
Who the fuck is Cassandra and is he autistic or not
5+ $BB DD posts in last week but no one listens  🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
im happy to see all the gain porns from gme and other meme stocks but please remember the death of spy, the huge market. may it rise tomorrow again.
BB & NOK calls tmrw✌
Oh dang nice
This is the way
7pm Est
Oh yeah duh I kinda feel like a moron now. 

Still doesn’t explain why it never really rebounded tho
Didn’t fuck the wife last night was saving myself for some of these GME posts

Who am I kidding yah I fucked her and I jerked off later on
still in a downtrend on longer TFs, coming up on the trendline now. i suspect this is people frontrunning a potential S&P inclusion but who knows.

i'd see how it reacts tomorrow
$2mm to exercise, wasn't going to be a cheap option. Easier to sell.
They aren't "worthless"  - they have just lost value.

Tomorrow, when the market opens, sell them for whatever you can.  You will likely have lost money, but, who knows?

Buy the shit out of BB you fucking retards, I want money
Hundreds you say? I am erect.
Depends. To be in compliance for NASDAQ listing a company must be above $1/share for 30 consecutive days. If it falls below $1/share for 30 days, they’ll be given 180 days to meet compliance again or be delisted. If delisted they’ll pay you out for your shares.
Square moved slowly at first and dropped to $40 at the lowest during the March pandemic crash. They just closed at $232.
Should that matter? All aspects shou be considered when assessing risk... You also only mentioned 1 metric to justify. Agai gold has been arou for thousands of years and there's a reason its price is where its at... Tesla has not been arou for thousands of  years... It's a relatively new company that is valued more than every single car company out together... Now how is that realistic when their p/e is 1500? Oh ya it isn't. Tesla stock is a needle In a hay stack. Telling someone to buy now Imo is massively risky...

All in all you are not understanding what im saying. As this guy wants to buy buy his first stock with his hard earned money you'd be a dick to tell him to buy tesla.

I don't care if your a bull or bear of tesla but it is overvalued and that is common knowledge.

That's the problem with these threads guys like you tell Joe blow trying to get into Investing and the stock market just a bit l, you tell em to buy stock A casue you got In super early and are up whatever 100% and no Joe blow is buyinf in at ATH and oh now 2 weeks later Joe blow is down 20%. And you feed off people like that, sickens me really
I would feel a lot better if GME was $40 in AH
You think this is done? I'm sitting on some $100 LEAPS that have been marvelous so far.
Fuck yeah!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Management changes, short squeeze. Like GME
Will Buyden be live streaming his stimmy plan on Twitch?  


Yeet!
ahhh that make sense, I didn't realize the profit calculator could essentially become irrelevant based on what happens in between. 

maybe I'll YOLO the $200 but can maybe clear up capital to buy some shares tomorrow.
ah k. good shit fellow rtrd
Not what I was asking
citron gonna manipulate LMND tomorrow.  who's rolling dice on 1 day puts?

China’s  big state-owned firms are likely to face growing pressure to make  payments on their debt this year as Beijing moves to tighten credit  growth, government researchers and analysts said.

Last  year, Chinese state firms defaulted on 71.8 billion yuan (US$11.1  billion) worth of debt, accounting for 51 per cent of all defaults, and  the largest default total for state firms since China first allowed  onshore bond defaults in 2014, according to data from the National  Institution for Finance & Development (NIFD), a government-linked  think tank.

“\[The  data\] actually confirms our long-standing view that the \[challenges  facing the\] Chinese economy involve solving the problems of [state-owned enterprises](https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3096924/chinas-state-owned-giants-given-new-order-create-global)  to a considerable extent. \[This is the same situation\] in the real  economy and in the financial sector,” said Li Yang, chairman of the  NIFD, at a seminar on China’s bond market in Beijing on Tuesday.

In  fact, credit growth in China reached a peak in the last quarter of  2020, and it is now showing signs of slowing down. Overall, national  credit growth, based on total aggregate financing data – which measures  fund flows from the financial sector to non-financial sectors in the  forms of loans, bonds and trust investment plans – slowed for the second  straight month to 13.3 per cent year in December from a year earlier,  according to data released this week by China’s central bank.

“We  believe a managed tightening is in sight, as Chinese policymakers  carefully balance growth and risks. For now, policymakers are  maintaining a cautious, calibrated approach to policy easing, which is  reflected in tighter financial conditions at this stage of the recovery.  In the past, calibrating policies to balance growth and financial  stability have led to stop-go credit-driven business cycles in China,”  US rating agency Standard & Poor’s said in a note on Wednesday.

Liu  Jinsong, vice-president at ICBC Wealth Management, said overall debt  increased at most state companies last year as a result of credit  easing.

“There  is a trend of credit tightening, so we expect that the defaults of weak  state-owned enterprises and \[those\] at the bottom of the pile will be  highly contagious and will impact the entire credit market,” Liu said at  Tuesday’s bond market seminar.

In November, [Yongcheng Coal & Electricity Holding Group](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3110651/china-deepens-probes-roles-rating-agency-banks-and-brokers-after),  a mine operator in Henan owned by the provincial government, failed to  make principal and interest payments on a 1 billion yuan commercial  paper, despite its AAA rating, triggering a [wave of panic selling](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3110233/china-debt-defaults-stoke-unease-about-broader-market)in the bond market.

This  led to many state firms cancelling fundraising plans as a result of  weak investor confidence in their financial positions despite their  investment-grade ratings. Securities houses, accountants and rating  agencies involved are under investigation by Chinese regulators  regarding their role in the Yongcheng bond scandal.

Many bonds issued by Chinese companies, including state-owned firms, have been [rated as investment-grade](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3114069/china-debt-will-self-disclosed-scandal-bring-back-ratings) but the default rate of AA+ bonds was an astonishing 82 per cent last year, NIFD data showed.

“As  soon as the market went down, it was discovered that many AAAs and AAs  became just junk bonds,” the NIFD’s Li said. “I know that our relevant  departments have noticed this problem and are paying great attention to  it.”

Many  state-owned firms, despite being rated investment-grade, are weak due  to high leverage and poor profitability, analysts said. What’s more,  their financial positions are likely to get worse when Beijing gradually  begins withdrawing its credit market stimulus, potentially increasing  their borrowing costs.

To rescue its coronavirus-hit economy last year, China unleashed a [flurry of stimulus measures](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3083268/china-coronavirus-stimulus-what-measures-have-been-used),  including cutting taxes and increasing the issuance of special treasury  bonds to fund infrastructure investment by local governments, which  lifted the central government’s budget-deficit ratio to a record high of  3.6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). In addition, the People’s  Bank of China (PBOC) provided trillions of yuan in extra liquidity to  the market, driving down interest rates and borrowing costs.

“A  good AA is much better than a bad AAA-rated bond, so you can’t just  look at the credit rating. It is necessary to avoid AAA-rated  state-owned enterprises with overcapacity and heavy historical burdens,”  Yun Zhanhua, vice-president of First Capital Securities, said at the  same seminar.

China’s  state firms have traditionally taken on important social  responsibilities, such as ensuring adequate employment. But despite  rounds of restructuring in the state sector, and efforts to open up the  Chinese economy, some sectors such as coal continue to suffer from  falling prices and bloated workforces. And transforming them to  commercially viable businesses has been slow.

“From  a macroeconomic perspective, the overall leverage has to be  stabilised,” Yi was quoted as saying. “The impact of the pandemic drove  down GDP growth, causing our leverage, and in turn our overall debt to  GDP, to rise significantly. The growth of leverage has already slowed  since the third quarter of 2020. \[We\] estimate it will return to a  basically stable direction.”

Chinese  regulators are increasingly concerned about the fallout from the  emergency economic measures introduced early this year, which caused the  nation’s debt-to-GDP ratio to rise to 266.4 per cent of GDP at the end  of the third quarter, up from 245.4 per cent at the end of the third  quarter in 2019, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  (CASS). The State Council-affiliated think tank expects China’s  debt-to-GDP ratio to hit 275 per cent for the whole of 2020.

Li,  who was a former vice-president at CASS, also warned that keeping  borrowing costs low for an extended period could worsen the  proliferation of Chinese [“zombie companies”](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2185186/china-steps-efforts-close-failed-zombie-companies-2020-faces),  which are long-term money-losing firms, often state-owned, and are  effectively insolvent but have been kept alive only by bank loans and  government subsidies.

“Generally  speaking, enterprises are beneficiaries because of the greater  availability of loans and improved financing costs \[from the economic  stimulus\]. However, we note that it is precisely because of such  availability and low cost that we end up with a big problem – the  problem of zombie companies,” Li said.

“The  accumulation of these kinds of liabilities by state-owned enterprises  has been going for many years,” Yun said. “It is difficult to change.  Once the capital funding chain is broken, it is very dangerous.”

PBOC  governor Yi Gang said in an interview with the state-run Xinhua News  Agency last week that monetary policy in 2021 should be stable, and that  liquidity should be kept reasonable and ample.
HS teacher here. I'm a log way out from fire but the thing I love most about my job is the social aspect. Even during breaks I have to strategically plan things that let me socialize. 

All I want is a job that stops when work day ends and lets me socialize/help people. No idea exactly what it'll be yet but I definitely don't intend to stay home when I retire.
I think he is talking about getting delisted or somethin? Maybe some secret rule on the subreddit I didn't know about or something lol.

Only way you’re making serious money is some Tesla calls with that 1100 bucks
If it expires ITM you exercise and buy 100 shares and it expires OTM it’s worthless

Better just selling it if you dont want to own 100 shares of said stock
strapped in and ready for take off. BB to the moon. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
i get the feeling many of you try to put both socks on at the same time
Yeah 42 here lol. Hope it goes up!
Think he made his first post on GME in September 2019. Over a full year ago he called this shit. He put serious money into it. About $100k all totaled. 

First few updates is nothing but people calling him a moron for ever buying Gamestop. Eventually after a few updates people start calling him a moron for not taking profits. Eventually, in the past couple of months, people have recognized Him as God taken the form of man to walk among us and given him the respect he fucking deserves. 

It's an absolutely incredible story and bet. He turned 100k into a fucking retirement. He can seriously actually just retire right now and live a great life. He can't buy 10 boats but he never really has to worry about money again.
I'm not sure if you are joking or not, so if this is a joke I'm sorry. Anyway:

Yes. Gamestop was founded in 1986 so it's their 35th birthday this year. They have faced alot of challenges this year, but overcame every single one of them. Just like Joe did himself. 

***"We will not go quietly into the night!***

***We will not vanish without a fight!***

***We're going to live on!***

***We're going to survive!"***

Happy birthday, Gamestop
thats very specific but I appreciate it
POSH blazing today. Got get in on that tomorrow
To late to buy BB in the AM?
Fair enough😂 and yeah I would suck someone dry for two green days. I’m tired of morning pumps that limp dick immediately
Pbw better US exposure
dibs on second
Wow not even any GME here
Found the guy who missed out
This is literally just the beginning. UberKikz tweeted that short interest was UP to 77 million as of yesterday. Not only is this not the squeeze, the shorts are actually quintupling down (I’ve lost track at this point). I’m starting a petition to change all our sell orders from $420.69 to $694.20.

DON’T CAUSE A SELLOFF AT $420.69 AND LET MELVIN OFF EASY. $694.20 TO ALL MY 💎👏 HOMIES
BB is the biggest monster I have ever seen LOL
Thanks for the advice! Good luck as well!
News what?
yeah i use e-trade/TD with no issues
what funds?
Perhaps, but that’s not how you maximize returns over the long-term.
Yes, it’s very effective as a hedge of a long position.

I’m just starting out myself, just waiting for some funds to transfer into my app, you probably have already answered this but there’s lots of comments, do you have any advice for what you think is most important not to do as a beginner?
Interesting. So then what do you come to the sub for?
Holly fuck this is so fucking stupid I cant stop laughing lmao

Need more detail.

What kind of debt at what interest rate?

Where would you invest?

How much of an emergency fund do you have?

If you don't have at least 1 month of expenses saved (preferably 3+), save it.  If you have savings and it's high interest debt, pay it.  If it's low interest debt and you have savings, invest it.
Seems like when conservatives accuse the left of something, it’s an admission of their own guilt. 

All of the nonsense about George Soros paying BLM protesters or Sandy Hook being paid actors, every homophobic anti-gay marriage senator secretly banging the pool boy etc etc.
Think it’s a long term hold

why the hell didnt you tell the rest of us?!
BTW: Although it was earlier this week that somebody asked, apparently as yields go up, dividend stocks can struggle. 

That might have been the reason for the utility sector to have some trouble and might have been the reason that it did better yesterday when we saw yields run into some trouble.

How much did he actually invest initially?
I think everyone here knows that institutional short sellers are the worst type of scum.  We all see the ways that they operate.  Market manipulation is the whole basis of what they do.  So it is real nice to them getting what they deserve from retail YOLO traders.  We really busted off one in their fucking ass today.  Fuck them.

I think your best bet would to be to take a look at several different stocks to get an idea of they’re option contracts at different prices, write them down, and check back in a week to see how they’ve changed. Sometimes options are dirt cheap, and sometimes they’re super expensive, I’m sure the reasons I’ve listed above are big factors, but I have no clue what else makes them tick.
That's deep

You're grasping at straws to shit on people that made money when you didn't believe in the play. Congratulate people that hit big and move on dude. It's crazy how many people on this sub **hate** when other people make money.
not sure why but i bought GME calls expiring tomorrow and went from 0% - 200% -0% within 20 minutes.
Is that legal?
Can someone explain this to me?  Im just starting to figure out how these calls work.  Why $2m to exercise?  And say if he had $2m to exercise them, would he have made much more money that way...how does that work?

Dude, look at TSLA. Valuations dont matter, that is no reason
Check the faq in r/options \- lots of basic stuff there. Also you can learn more at the OCC/CBOE education site - [https://www.optionseducation.org/optionsoverview/](https://www.optionseducation.org/optionsoverview/) 

But yes - if you are buying an option - the most you can lose is the cost of the option.
Just put a sell order at 60 or something.
If you’re not borrowing from family and friends, are you even into stocks?
good luck 🥴
Okay you loony toons. BUY at open tomorrow. 

Man I love you guys.
Honestly, nice fuckin work, man.
technically a 1.58 M gain.  The gain from his 1/15 calls aren't shown
Buy or die
my 1 contract for GME 23c 1/15 cost me $24 and I sold it for $1,500.  Then I bought more with that and it turned to shit :(

Can only rely on a moon landing for tomorrow.  Otherwise, I'm in deep space without a suit.
GME just needs to split :) need more shares!
Look up BlackBerry QNX. That’s all you need to know.

Partnerships with BIDU, NVDA (NIO), AMZN, etc.
Well I bought at 20 at $425, so you have better odds than me.
Best suggestion is to have an exit plan. Sell XX% shares at XX% gains. For instance you have 100 shares, set an exit price for 20 of them, than a higher exit price for 40, than an unreasonably high price for 20 and an unspeakable price for the reaming 20... Values depend on your risk tolerance... Stick to the plan! Good luck man! See you on the battlefield tomorrow!
You are good. Trust the Joe to go balls deep in saving the planet.

Never thought I'd say this but I should've bought *way* more calls on APHA back in September.
touche lol
Fuck man PLUG looking for another ass day tm
How does this sub feel about options? If everyone likes pennys here. If your sure enough of a catalyst to buy a ton of stocks why not buy a call for a fraction of the price and then sell? I did this with CRON the other day turned $40 to $155 in just 2 days with 5 contracts because of all the talk of weed stocks going up. I couldn’t have afforded 500 shares. Not sure if this is a smart play and I barley understand option trading at all so any tips would be appreciated. 

It seems like buying just slightly OTM brings you just as good a return as loading up on a ton of stock, then I suppose if it really rockets you could buy it at a still fairly low price when the contract is up? Maybe I’m missing something.
Damn, I love your thesis.
I’m in
Y'all are crazy
Puts on malarkey.
Continuing to hold these amazing GME shares 🙏🙏🙏

[Tesla \(TSLA\) Q4 2020 earnings call with Elon Musk set for January 27](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-q4-2020-earnings-call-january-27/)

Prepare for the TSLA run up for no reason despite knowing it'll be a negative net revenue, that is the way.
Serious question. Do you guys care if GME survives/thrives as a company, or is your primary concern making righteous tendies off of the short squeeze/faith in Cohen/whatever else it takes to make tendies?

tl;dr: Do you care more about GME as a company, or just making tendies?
How we feeling tomorrow about tesla calls. Holding rn
They make clothes and water bottles. Check the store on their website
If GME hits $50 I will quit my job & post it here no cap.
go all in on 800
Wtf it's up 31% in the last month

No, see, it was an exact prediction.  No luck involved 😂
You're good for holding ICLN long-term because you're diamond-handed asf
im too dumb, explain what im seeing.
I’ve had TLRY since beginning of December. Bought more yesterday, and today I’ll buy more as we approach the 🌑
I came here for the daddy Cohen squeeze and I'm not leaving until I get it
Everyone
MSTR is correlated with bitchcoin because of their holdings. The actual business is garbage.
It won’t.
When do you need to register as a self-employed daytrader with the IRS? When does it change from a side-hustle?
it's a zero dilution marijuana sub penny stock...this is going up
Fidelity, I'm in the minority here but i like their site and their index fund choices, and all my retirement accounts were already with them
Should have done that. Instead I just put it in my list so I can buy when they’re done
$20 and I'll sell
imagine thinking GameStop is anything but a short..  the future of gaming is digital and streaming.  GameStop is nothing but the blockbuster of yester years.  If you made money on gamestop, sell it while others are still buying.
was almost thinking you're still in the 1/15s lol. good shit m8
Yes brother
Can always just buy back at a higher strike price, right? Bought some wfc today. Im too easily manipulated by this sub.
It seems like it’s not possible after some research, best way looks to be having a separate software for charting and using them in conjunction.

I’ve been using the zeroweb, and yeah it’s not the best, i think i’m just going to switch to zeropro as i’ve heard it’s considerably better.

As for my experience with Tradezero i’ve only been paper trading thus far, so can’t say much about execution or live trading. The customer service is great though.
Wait for Biden speech
IF YOU AIN'T BUYING WOOF AT OPEN, YOU AIN'T BLACK
That makes sense. I think when I buy calls I usually try to find the best value and most realistic chance of breaking the strike price
I wanna see WSB pump PLTR to show the citibank who is boss
You mean pump and dump- bump and dump is doing cocaine after eating Taco Bell.
You’re making my cream my shorts king
Is it bad that my boomer dad is also all 💎👏 on this too?!?

Fair. I realized this after the fact. It’s reflected in the cash balance. 👍🏻

Lol have you heard of TSLA?
All I’m gonna say is $ZENYF. Look into it if you’re wanting less stress and something to hold in these rough times
Wife’s boyfriends gonna be pissed when he hears about how many lean hog and corn calls I purchased on margarine
tee hee
Can’t wait to get home from work and beat my dick raw to these tendies
You sell the contract on the market to someone else.  That other person then exercises the options.  It's no longer you're issue to deal with.  Typically its a larger firm that's exercising the option to buy the stock.  But that's between them.
Y'all having fun with GME but I enjoyed NCLH today my shares went 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Why did BB moon today? What did I miss?
Priced in most likely
Sorry fellas, going to sell all my GME to dump into $1 billion Mega Millions tomorrow.
BB predictions by june of this year?
Hey this guy got it wrong. Switching mining coins is not that simple. ASIC miners are used to mine BTC on the SHA256 algo, they are designed for this algorithm. They can only mine this algorithm effectively. They can not mine Ethash or any other algorithm effectively. So no they can't just swap what to mine. 

They are absolutely going to lose value if BTC loses value. They are mooning on the speculation that BTC goes up even more.
$MAC 3/19 20C 🚀🚀🙈🙈🙈🚀🙈🚀🚀 THEIR EARNINGS ARE COMING UP TOO. ALREADY 10,000$ up🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Should I hold POSH, WOOF, and AFRM?
All this FOMO in the chat is scaring the crap out of me
Fuck tech & tech stocks, shit hasn't moved in months, can't believe im still playing this shit..
I'm holding APHA untill the gap between APHA and Tilray closes.
I can AND DO imagine 🤩
Earning fell short and going woke on trump.  While I'm not trying to be political with it, it can create user base backlash and other politicans will wonder "maybe i might be deplatformed, what laws can I pass?"
I deleted this post so it sure if y’all can see, but my $44k position is now worth $66.5k one day later.

$22k single day rise, 50.78% gain on my whole portfolio. MSTR will continue to print, this is the most obvious play I’ve ever seen and it actually feels illegal.
I was hoping someone would use this meme
Lol
The cult of Elon would never let it go that low.  He's made too many millionaires that are fiercely loyal and just won't ever get out of TSLA.  If TSLA ever got anywhere near 150 again I would move my entire net worth into it.
$ROPE you & I both.
Lol holy shit

Its an ETF bro, your chillin.
got in at 255 a few days ago thought it was a good deal, fml

I fucking love your diamond fucking hands.  Just last week your total was 3 mill.  Now it's 7.3 million.

How the fuck do you sleep at night holding this shit.  Fucking hero !!!
In as well, 100 shares!  I want to just sell weekly puts and buy more shares!
I shifted some gains from SOL to PLUG and GME this morning.  PLUG better pan out after this speech.  SOL is still rocketing ever upwards.
He stated the truth. But I doubt the average person bought and sold on the same day.

Gme 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🪐
Well I’ve had calls for 2 weeks I was hoping for a run up so maybe next week or maybe it responds good to Biden tonight. Fuck break $131 and stay there.
the problem with PLTR is that it's not really a story stock and even if it is it's not a story that people like... basically big brother surveilance state shit.

it's also a product with very few clients so people don't see it in use in their everyday life.

they need some BIG partnerships or BIG contracts (not this 5 million dollar shit, this is supposed to be a 50 billion dollar company) or it's just going to continue bleeding out.
I see you boomers.
Just let it be assigned and buy some more shares or sell an atm put (depends on IV situation)
Look into the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset features of Social Security to make sure you're getting the full SS and Pension that you expect.
Really? I was thinking 50% of my acc 900
I finally sold the calls I bought before earning and now it looks like its time for me to get fucked again
I'm pretty skeptical. Even the best-case latency from the speed of light isn't great for many types of games across long distances. There would have to be huge data centers spread out geographically.

I can definitely see certain games moving to the cloud, but I'm not sure physics will allow for all games to work that way.
Sigh keep this shit to yourself. I sold yesterday.
But dinosaur juice isn't hydrogen lmao
And don’t use stake it’s fucking trash go open up a real brokerage account where you can use options or CFDs
its always just been about money
The vaccine is now in the process of evolving from speculation to reality. When stocks are speculative, the price can move all over the place. When news comes through, now it's a matter of understanding what the revenue picture is going to look like going forward and knowing how much of it is already priced in. In order to assess that and watch it play out, it requires patience and a lot of homework. Rather than do that, a lot of investors took their profits and went on to the next shiny thing. If you believe that there are longer-term profits off the vaccine and the coming 3 or 30 months aren't effectively pricing that in, then keep your shares and enjoy the ride. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr version - buy the rumor sell the news.
RIP to the algo  selling 1 share below bid every second on TSLA, BABA, SPY, QQQ's
They’ll get burned and lose. Everyone is a genius fund manager during a bull market. They don’t understand portfolio theory, but have made money so they think they’re smart. Everyone has different liquidity needs and risk tolerance... the only thing I shame people for are insurance “investment” products. Because they’re horrible investments from a liquidity, return, and cost perspective.

I don't believe TSP offers any sort of in-service withdrawals for Roth contributions. It didn't sound like that was a concern in the original hypothetical, given the Age 57 pension. Having the fully tax-free growth would be awfully appealing and offer some spending flexibility beyond Age 59.5 (e.g. buy a new car in cash or take a once-in-a-lifetime vacation all without any impact on your taxes).

Still trying to understand the cost of buying options. Am I correct with my math? .04*100*30 = 120?

You can lose 120 on a bet and have unlimited gains?
Sold a bunch of patents to Chyna and won a NATO contract.

GME pushing AH.
Uhhh....

GME pinned to $40 based on options

SPG breaks out above $96

EV and renewables get one last ride after Biden tonight


That’s what happens tomorrow
So $BB is the next $GME like play?
You shouldn't feel like a dick. OP could've bought almost any stock in the entire world in any time march and after and made buckets of money.
Was granted 38k options at my company (very popular and well known tech health startup) with $3.50 grant price. Only half vested and will take 2 more years to fully vest. We’re prepping for IPO this year. Pretty damn bullish on this company, but have an itch to leave. Should I stick it out and get all 38k options? Never been part of an IPO before so not sure if these would turn into millions or not. What y’all do?
Yeah it went stupid after earnings and even if it does dip down ima hold that’s just gonna mean the hulk dick that’s gonna be on our screens is gonna be bigger with everyone buying the dip
It's holding it's value impressively steady at $38-40. This has so much room to run.
Agree, April calls deep itm are chill..
Watch his YT channel - RoaringKitty for his DDs that he has been posting since a really long time.
Yeah but dude said the Burry is diamond handing GME.  Which is the exact opposite of what he did.
Thanks chad
Question yall, are we still holding GME? I’m holding a shit load on GME and a contract on BB
Did you hear about that European company that apparently is working on a similarly Covid drug and is already on phase 3 of their trials?
Time to buy again  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 🚀🚀🚀
COHEN MAKE THE 🚀POP
No kidding, I mean something like GME is fucking fantastic but its also terrible for people who dont know what they are doing. I saw some stupid high calls this afternoon and it sets up unrealistic expectations for people who dont know the pain of losing
So... Tim 🍏 I need you to pleas fly again thx
Can you buy OTC premarket in TD?
Cool name nibba
why
That would be awesome to have Daddy Musk just say fuck it and buy up shares just to spite shorters
I just hope he don't stutter and lose his train of thoughts again, I think most people will just wait for a tl;dr. He's good for the market but his speeches are snooze fest.
I wish I had more money to invest back then. But I bought a little of Shop, Tesla, and Amd. All were winners.

Im not buying but what the fuck is up with ddd these days

You are an idiot
but does anyone know why it's going up?
Yah ?
I wish you luck brethren
We care more about the shorts squeeze. That being said, if they can improve some of their operations, than they could be a decent company. That's where Cohen comes in
fuck these haters idk why this sub is so negative now. r/daytrading and r/wallstreetbets(when you get passed the memes and BS) is way more educational.

99% of people are better off buying and holding long term investing. But if you want to learn to daytrade why not? At least you made some money and the knowledge you've picked up is invaluable.
Sorry I don't know much about these things. But whats the minimum price GME has to maintain for this to occur?
powell told you to exit all markets i hope you got the memo
Wtf I look like, GME CEO? I don't even go to the mall bro. But if tendies, I'm in!
Kinda weird PLTR keeps trending down, despite contract announcements. Gotta feeling PLTR going to explode after lockup, not dip.

Every financial analyst ragging on PLTR, like its a concerted effort to buy in when mass of shares open up.

I’m not selling any covered calls that expire after lockup in case I get burned
New ceo and new phone coming out? There's a conference tmrw I think about their plan moving forward, apparently some big news.
Good bot
Any and all strength for the revolution is accepted
stop daddy uwu
not really
The same thing you do to your dick after you came. A short squeeze to get te goodie good out.
This also seems relatively safe? Since the strike price is close and the expiration date is March, it gives you an opportunity to get to $12-15 or more for instance? 

I’m also learning that the option price fluctuates, so what’s “profit” depends on a few things

What do you think about IEVD?
Do you guys think someone from the institutions will try to make a dirty quiet deal with GME CEO over the break to fuck us over? We storm the GME capitol if this happens
Yes and yes
My guess is they’re not retarded enough to understand that.

Jesus, I sold my 8$ positions to buy more calls. what was your strike price, like 0.1?
GM flatlined for 5 years, I know everyone here loves to hate them, but I'm telling you this is turning into a tech stock, buy leaps while the IV is cheap.

I should not buy at this price.

Fuck, I should have bought at that price.

I definitely should not buy at this price.

Woah fuck I should have bought at that price.

Not buying here.  

Fuck.
I have three 1/21/22 BB 10c in a 1.02 each......am i gonna be rich????
Lost $700 today and I feel awful.
Shorting GME right now is a once in a lifetime opportunity at these prices....timing it is the problem. And I'm sure speculators are thinking the same. Could be more shorts to squeeze out soon, and some massive bags all around eventually.

US Option costs 3,5 $ at IB Europe, it costs only 0,5 $ at degiro.

same thing was here in pltr man.
who cares just pump and dump. those cars look stupid
confused? sell 50% of it

if the price goes up, you will say thank god i still keep 50% of it

if the price goes down, same thing, thank god i already sold 50% of it :)
Fuck I miss butterfinger BB’s.
I just bought Tesla stocks and made almost 1k in 2 weeks....
HAH. nice
I think this is the euphoric i have seen WSB. No way this doesnt end in disaster
This is why deepfake technology was a mistake.
So the standard process.

I mean, I get it, we pay a lot of taxes, increasing the pre-tax contributions will definitely help us some *today*.  I'm just thinking like, hey maybe 3-5 years from now we want to replace the wife's car and if we we're dumping a bunch into taxable then... here's the cash.
This is not true. For search and social, yes, but banners, retargeting, preroll, audio, and CTV are largely ran through DSPs like TheTradeDesk, Amazon DSP, and hundreds of other smaller players. As CTV continues to take over for traditional TV, these companies will continue to grow.

Google has exposure to programmatic, but Facebook is fairly limited to ads on their platform. They have an audience network, but it's going to be worthless with iOS 14 and the elimination of 3rd party cookies. So, FB's revenue will need to come from an increasing user base (tough to do now that they can't buy competitors) or additional products outside of FB/IG/WhatsApp.
I’ll subscribe. I don’t care if you’re hot or not

BBBY has been getting pumped the last day or so because of the massive short interest, right?
Damn congrats on this week
FB pleas fly again
Nah, it's actually super aggressive.  I'd aim for something more conservative if I did it again.  I mean, what on earth does BLACKBERRY have in store that justifies a near 30% gain in a month.

 But the rest of my spreads in steel are doing fine so... 🚀
I saw a SPAC post on the front page of marketwatch lol
Anyone else with level 2 see that massive sell wall on gme? Looks like someone's desperate to keep it below 40 tomorrow

**SFIX is such a bizzare stock**
Was at $40.10 at 3:59:55 then dropped
I'm looking for other stocks that are heavily shorted to try for a repeat of what happened to GME.

A few of them up biggly today.

1. SPCE - 31.1 % of the float shorted!!!
2. MAXR - 10.74 % of the float shorted.
3. MSTR - 17.6% of the float shorted.

Any autists know of any others?

Can you elaborate on why, provide some rationale man.
someone should calculate how much he would be at if he held all of the other 1/15 calls at the various strikes

Gonna sell clean power capital🤑🤑
U should never sell those options.
Just like he wrote his own books 🤡
IV go down make option value go down even if stonk go up
This.  So This.
I guess the math can favor the options selling within a certain risk margin. 

"The option *has* to go up by X more before executing is worth more than the premium now, but if I wait and sell the option later after the stock plateaus, the premiums I'll get will be lower."

This is territory where I can understand the principal a lot faster than I can just do the math in my head. I'm guessing there are calculators or sites people use for this.
Realistically, if it's ever going to hit the 1.5-2 range, there would need to be good news regarding their pipeline trial results. Other than that, I doubt it'll sky rocket. They're expecting important trial results within Q1, so it may be another month or two.
GME pinned just below 40, one day before puts expire worthless, tomorrow is gonna be lit
uhm no. Person is pretty clearly putting themselves out there for what they did. People are giving them a realistic outlook on their outcome. Better to set the person’s expectations than everyone to pat them on the back like they did something special
Let’s see you beat the s&p 20 years from now.

Should I buy some $BB ?
> large amount of growth in the last 2 years actually mathmetically worse than normal growth for someone early in their invest,ing career?

Only if you assume it happened at the expense of future years growth.
I love that I sold apha, baba, black berry, icln all before they ripped:( I still got gains but missed the huge break outs
Get rich quick without skill or effort. My edge in the market? Glad you asked. I read daily discussion for hours daily and zone out watching sp500 minute candles every day
Yeah. I done goofed.
BB my dude pump it to the fucking moon
Amen and Awomen
Do you happen to know the timeline? I just read HPQ has less than a year of cash runway + a ton of insider selling. Makes me nervous!
Indeed we are! But we need to stay United for $BB and $PLTR now.
My only regret is not having the funds to buy more
I had sens over a year ago. :(
Held the bag. Sold for a sizeable loss.
Fuck it
Why is this getting upvoted
yeah... that’s rough damn. why didn’t you just hold them? you won’t see immediate gains
Have you heard abt SPACS??
market more likely to correct bigly before these move anywhere
it's an optimal scenario. I personally would be shocked to see anything over 65 tomorrow.
Hahaha. Good one. I was busy making actual money. ;)
tHe EnD of CHinA dRaWS cLoSE
What dip
So thats a no for you?
She’s his wife now.
Just bought 1100 BB shares, half on margin
I believe in GME in long run, they will change their business plan and it'll generate money. It will take some time however. PLTR i'm not really a fan of.

But BB ow baby, these boys already changed their course. They own the EV market, they own the cybersecurity market and they cash in from their old market (smartphones) by selling patents. In a couple of days/week when I'll divert the GME gainz to BB, which will then take me to MARS  🚀🚀🚀
IV?
Five straight quarters of net profit and more cars delivered than ever and you expect negative net revenue?
Still you, but you're a rich retard now
Dude...seriously, screw all these idiots saying "maybe this isn't for you". Investing is a long game. Just continue to invest and learn from your mistakes. You will be fine.
Small position? Like 1 share? I had just enough left in my account after spending it all on GME that I bought 1 share. Tooooooo infinity! And beyond!
Can I just Venmo someone my money and they invest it? All I do is make bad bets
Ford has made a quite a pretty penny these past couple days. I got 2600 shares at 8.50.  Ive added ~500 shares in the past 2 weeks or so but ill buy more if it dips but it might take a breather soon so ima sell calls and throw it into BB cuz I agree with WSB on this one that BB looks like a literal rocket and amazing buy right now.  

Ima open a BB position tomm for the first time cuz i only saw it today.  Starting, itll be ~500 to 1k in leaps and 1-2k in stocks.  

But im SUPER bullish on Ford.  Literally 100% of my portfolio is ford right now lol
SPY you mean? would be 20-50% just putting cash in the S&P alone any time after march last year.
Give me some seriously under rated tickets. I need a fresh watchlist

> stock values are based on memes as an argument that it's going to dump.

GME is *absolutely* a stock value based on memes. Like even the people pumping it know that. This company was literally on the verge of death before WSB decided to induce a short squeeze last year. 

> You're grasping at straws to shit on people that made money when you didn't believe in the play. Congratulate people that hit big and move on dude. It's crazy how many people on this sub hate when other people make money.

I already did. And just because I have a different opinion than yours and the hivemind's doesn't make me bitter or a hater lol. I've struck gold on plenty of meme tickers from this community and I love it for that. But like, you shouldn't be putting Gamestop on a pedestal. Just fuck her and leave.

Retard here. I am leveraged to the tits
They aren’t free to sell it “whenever”. There’s a contract which says when. And I’m assuming we’re talking about someone with enough assets to never risk a margin call.
the only point when "IT IS TOO LATE" is when the squeeze has already been squoze, so no.
Stand fast GME Gang, sitting on 400 shares Av. cost 21.27 and various calls. Haven't sold shit, in fact, second round student loans getting disbursed next week and I am throwing it ALL into GME. I'm the bank now.

I got my first paystub of the year and it shows my state taxable wages are higher than my gross income. My federal taxable wages look right, and is less my 401k other deductions. This has to be a mistake right?

Just watch the goalposts move yourself.

“It’s gonna crash when Biden wins”

“No no, it’s gonna crash if Dems take the senate”

“No no, it’s gonna be when Biden takes office”.

Etc.

In reality, a crash could happen tomorrow, or in a year, or in ten.  You don’t know, I don’t know.  Also: you can’t predict it, I can’t predict it.

The market of right here right now amid the worst economic news since the Great Depression should tell you all you need to know about expecting market numbers to line up perfectly with your perception of reality.
Depends on your personality/emotional intelligence more than anything. Most people should stick with mutual funds and not venture into the lion's den.
My GME average is $19. Do I buy more sharesssss
Good for you using that leverage!
imagine if biden speaks tonight on his stimmy plan and mentions a tax raise for high earners and also doesn't mention anything about clean energy lmao.
Well if I sell them tomorrow it won’t be a day trade anymore and I think I’ll be fine then? I guess part of me was also confused about if my contract would sell today or tomorrow.. so I guess I can sell tomorrow at open and be okay? I bought them today.. which is why I’m so confused right now. And I have 1 “locked” PDT on robinhood. So 3/4 pdt already.

(Sorry tbh this is my second day trading with options.. and I realized I should make longer plays instead of focusing on very short term... my longer plays seem to be doing just fine... )
Oh man... I was hoping for a bbc

RemindMe! 1 day
I decided to get 100 shares the other day. I think there is definitely risk here and I'd hate to be catching a falling knife but I just cannot see how the news made it wipe 3 bill off the value. The medicine that they had the mixed results with the study is not worth 50% of their value they have 40 drugs in the pipeline and are one of the only ones working on DMD that already have drugs on the market. I think this is a risky play because of how easily a single downgrade made it drop and the volumes are low so ot can be pretty volatile but I decided to go for it after doing some research and ill see how it plays out. 

Ark did double down on their investment but I think what you need to consider there too is for them they are basically averaging down their buy in price because they already had a good amount of shares. However they have bought several days in a row now and I think this should be over 120 but I do think you might be waiting a while for the gain. The full details of the report won't even be available till later in the year. I just dont think  the entire companies value lies in the results of a single product.

this guy r/wallstreetbets and is on a rocket to tendie town on the moon!  (this sub is basically gambling advise! be careful... but the Memes are HQ and funny!)

but really...  if you just pay attention to the world there is a natural ebb and flow to things.  MJ is big topic and it is on the rise, and will stay that way for the next year or two. if some stuff gets delayed by gov. then it might drop again ... but that is when you "Buy the dip" in the price... double down, the long play will make more safely then trying to time it just right to "get rich quick"...  in the end it is all based on revenue and weed ... well sells itself.  

between tax incentives for states to fund programs, federal looking to pay for out national debt and compaines who just want $$...  there is never a shortage of people who want to use it. (hence the decades long black and gray markets for it)  

when that become no differnt that cigs, or beer... there will be a new "must have" thing in town...  clean energy? recycling? anything to stop global warming? etc...  just pay attenion and find the index / etf that tracks that thing.  buy and HOLD.  it'll make you money over time.  

I knew MJ would blow up 8 years ago when i saw gov. officials who left federal office and join the Board of Directors of a few of these companies (including officials who publicly opposed it's legalization!). They had no real sales yet, but millionaires with political power and connections were now invested and putting their power behind it, quietly.  This is how they secure generational wealth and power.

No, they are not a spac, and new company? Not so much, they're 6 years old (young af but not new) and they've been trading on the NSYE since October 2020.

They 100% reverse merged into facebank March 19, 2020.

There's a distinct difference between a reverse merger and a SPAC business combo.

I do think things are overvalued, but I’m also not sure that things are going to drop, at least in the short term. Lots of variables I believe coming into play. We have more stimulus that looks to be coming, Democrats printing more money, raising minimum wage, spending, which in theory hurts the value of the dollar and increase stock prices.  On the other hand you have potential for tax increases which would hurt the market. 

With that being said, my prediction is stock prices continue to rise in the short term while these spending plans are rolled out and more stimulus is sent as the dollar continues to decrease.  Then as life starts to really get back to normal probably next year, interest rates start to rise and tax increase plans are rolled out, the market will begin to drop.

Obviously you can’t predict or time the market and this could be completely wrong, but this is the thesis I have been using.

They're not worthless yet. The MARA call is worth around $0.42/share ($42 total). If MARA opens higher tomorrow, you should be able to sell for some money (may be a profit depending on how high it gaps up).

And the RLTY put is worth around $0.23/ share ($23 total). Again, you might sell for some money or profit if TLRY gaps down.

&#x200B;

My advice is to close both on market open tomorrow. Wait for 5-10 minutes after market open for the bids/asks to come in and sell for whatever you can get for both.

You didn't want either, or you don't understand what they are, get rid of them.

There is no reason to freak out, the worst that can happen is they drop to zero so you lose what you paid for them.
Your first mistake was relying on YouTube. There is so much garbage and marketing nonsense that it's almost impossible to find genuine content on the platform.
Someone @musk on Twitter about this hahahah
we got 3 months. Maybe lemonade can hold us over.
GME to 60
Like crude oil like wat
Let me be an example for you cool kids: my boomer ass paper handed that shot at a small profit. * discuss amongst yourselves.
What movie is this
Ngl but I started with 3000 and already made 6k profit, in 10 minutes. Make the correct decisions, do your DD and trust your gut. I don't know why everyone isn't playing roulette
That shit will be worth $200k+
You always buy more shares
WSB my friend
What a disgusting close and what a disgusting week. Fuck this market
I bought low and sold middle, I was holding them for months sold late last week.
lose your password
>	Great stock to swing trade daily

Those words... I don't think they mean what you think they mean lol. That's day trading. Swing trading is weeks, months.
my average was 18 and I sold a few days ago, I wanna die
I’m a retard and wanna blow my money in options. How do I reach this?
Me after not buying gme when it was at 18 and talking to my friends about it
Always has been 🔫
I bought another 100 shares at 33 and it brought me from 19.20 to like 23
Strap in retard. It gets a lot bumpier coming up, but fuck you and congrats
This made me feel better about losing 5k the last few days.
I’m all in on WOOF

Are you planning on staying at your parents place until you're 45 and "retired"?

I don't know if going from living with your mom and dad to living on your own in another country would work out, especially for someone as (literally) sheltered as you. I'd recommend moving out ASAP.
If you ever need a blow job, or someone to do your laundry, hit me up daddy 😘

I’m sitting on 42 and I have to go out on a damn boat tomorrow to deploy navy stuff so for the love of god if you see anything yell 😂

I think the question was clear enough, idiot.

^(im just kidding)
Dude...screw all these idiots saying 'maybe this isn't for you'. My ass. Investing is a long game. You already got a head start. Just continue to buy and learn from your mistakes. You will be fine over the long-term.

my sell orders are between 100 and 130
Get fukt poor
GME 45-50 tomorrow ??? 🚀🚀🚀
Hang in there! Use this time to reevaluate your positions. Only invest in what you believe in and stick to it. There are good days and bad days. Today was a bad one for you. Were stronger together! Best of luck.
I am also retarded. Bought FDs 55c right before close. But they were so cheap! 100 55c 1/15 .6 money is fake and only good for gambling.

He doesn't do daytrading though.
What about the new hellcrate hemi they just released?
Should’ve bought some CVS before Biden’s speech, maybe another chance tomorrow
$GME is up 100% last 2 days.

Sounds dead to me.
You are completely right that Google seems to have the problem of too many chefs in the kitchen but look at the project as an individual project and what its trying to do and not a forecast of things to come and you will see the potential in it. Yes there are massive hurdles to overcome but I wouldnt bet against big tech to overcome those, especially not Google. They will most definitely atleast try to overcome those hurdles, might be impossible but in this age? Many things today would seem like breaking the laws of physics to even Einstein
I don't follow this sub much. So can someone explain to me what's happening? Everyone buying GME? Would it be a bad idea to buy some tmm morning?
They announced a new EV
Is not getting a title better in this case? Doesn’t mean you get another pay increase when you do get the senior?

Yeah you can do a securities transfer
Just remember that for every autist who made mad gainz here, there are many more who didn't. Looking at these posts is like looking only at lottery ticket winners.
He won’t do it
Yes, it's all projection. Trump is as direct as anyone; he tells you exactly what he is doing. You just have to substitute his name back in for antifa, illegal immigrants, etc.
If Biden extends or gives more EV tax breaks... bullish
My sources have told me GameStop inc. is done and not just on twitch.
Why should you max Roth IRA in index funds if those are the ones you probably won’t be selling in long term. Shouldn’t you put the short term individual stocks in Roth IRA?
I have to admit I don't think it's a good thing when stocks just start flying and nobody can figure out what makes the company good.
or expire worthless :(

Please don't expire worthless
Dude I'm bearish on this euphoric market but the snap thing is retarded. How you going to dump on banning trump from the social media platform he is probably least relevant on.
Literally one google search would tell you. This is leveraged bit c oin, which you can’t find anywhere else. The c oin is poised to have a massive year and this is a way you can get a leveraged position for that. There isn’t an ETF and there aren’t futures trading, you can’t buy options for it on exchanges. This is a loophole in the financial system.
I think everyone on this sub is onboard with that
drug dealers use it

Its not... a concern necessarily.  But I'd like to be aware of the options.  If I wanted to buy that new car in cash at 51, it would be a lot easier if that money was in a taxable account, for example.  Or paying for college.  Or whatever.

Whoops. Tbh I was just trading options to learn, chose the company a relative works out. How neat is that?

I have no clue on how to even go about calculating how much GME stock is owned in this sub. I commend you for trying!

This was a price rise on fundamentals, not a fully  fledged short squeeze! Hopefully some better dd will confirm that. Gme was trading 0.2 x earnings but showed really good ecommerce revenue growth +303%. Thats exactly what they need to do to transition into the next phase of the company. All these boomers shouting short squeeze cant even see true value when its in front of their face. Fuck its a value play even at 40 its at 0.4x earnings??
500.25 he bought a fractional initially
I know it’s gonna get some hate but I’m gills deep in cciv. Waiting for the big pop. Could be a pump and dump but the risk is worth the potential
Your mama's tittays
At least you don't sell too late. That makes you better than 50% of this sub (Me included)
Options or stocks? And what positions you got?
I made 20 bucks on it, then blew it on a Tesla weekly. Am I playing this game correctly?!?!
Zm, x, gme got fk ton of shorts...
GM's new logo makes it look like a videogame company
All pump no dump
I don’t believe the numbers are accurate. There just is no way we haven’t blown by the wide majority of shorts liquidation prices.
It was a joke? BB is a pos pump and dump. And I hedged. You will learn what that means when you're down tomorrow and I'm not. ;)
Dfv i went in at 42, what should i do my sweet lord?

VALE 🚀🚀
Also in 2k shares 🚀
Lmao solid GME yesterday. Should I fomo back in now? Yes I know massive idiot
Fuck it, I’m in.
I mean that’s kind of what we’ve been doing all morning
If it does, it will be because of the short squeeze and not because the longs. My prediction is that if it goes to +20% tomorrow it will go to +100% tomorrow and if it goes to -15% tomorrow it will go to -50% tomorrow.
Also going to take a phone call mid conference on his blackberry
GME is the worst example of a bubble I've ever seen. But Tesla and SPCE yeah that shit is retarded.
Listen, I have been holding 15-16k shares and calls since it was at $13, bought more @ $20 and again another 500 shares @ $38. You’re not in a bad spot. There was consolidation like on Tuesday at $20.

Tomorrow we get another big green dildo
LIT really trying to fuck on me
Can’t wait
I like that
Gonna need GME to open at like $48
No one survives the PIP.  If you go on it, use that time to find a new job.

Moon in what sense? I see it returning to 15+-2 until their EV gets pushed. I was thinking Mar $11 or $12 calls.
OP i sold long dated calls today, the IV was too much.

also bought calls incase it hops to 50

probably a hedge

I’ve gone through those stretches, it will turn around. I do better holding cash instead of buying and holding hedges (aka puts), you’re just going to bleed out on either end.

As for profits, set a target you are comfortable with and stick with it. You’ll be more profitable in the long run.

This is all conspiratorial garbage, dude.   You don't know what you're talking about at all.

Do you actually have some kind of delusional disorder?    Actual banks, investment firms, and reputable companies would not work with crypto exchanges if this were true.   You are implying that hundreds of firms with tens of thousands of employees are in on a scam.
Good write-up. Your "Tomorrow's Expectation" was pretty much my plan today. Locked in a bit of profit at the low, but still holding on to some shorts. Risk is off the table though :)
My grampy’s stock is gonna 🚀me to poundtown

thanks for the comment, appreciate the input. the math could be retarded, or not. in any case, just buy and hold GME, and watch it rocket, is the moral of the story.
Just lol if u ain’t buying FB calls at these levels. Simps love Instagram. Boomers love Facebook. Somebody somewhere cares about oculus. Long dates. Zuckerbot.
Let me start by saying, what kind of 19yr old has $51k ?

On a serious note - you single ply toilet paper bitches, this has just begun.

Do you think get leaps or calls?

One idea I had was to work at a library. Seems like it would be pretty relaxing to just put books away in a nice quiet place. But I then learn that you most likely need a master’s degree to work at one and everyone else are just volunteers. Movie theater is another option as well, or maybe a night security guard.

You missed a bunch of these. But I gotcha 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I’m exercising while In positions. 
This keeps me from exiting as soon as I’m in loss or profit. 

My entries are often high risk and that’s why I like small accounts. I have to sent mental sl and get out when criteria is met. If I watch I will be in constant anxiety. As well as add more positions with the market. I have learned that stacking messes me up more times then not since retracemnts cause me to be over leverge.

But your question makes me think that I can add some Variations  if the losses stack up so that it doesn’t get boring. But the rule is it has to be a lot. 

So if it was jumping jacks it would be 300 or jogging in place for 20-30 minutes 

No simple shit so you can’t rush the process. It’s suppose to kick your ass.
Oh for sure I just saw snap down 4 dollars in one day and down on the week overall and saw a golden buying the dip opportunity
This is a hard knowledge check, you are too retarded to be talking.

BB and GME up 20%+ is it 2005?
Do it. 11 or nothing.
RemindMe! 1 day "did he lose or win"
I am hopeful. Better than expected iPhone 12 sales, captured 20% phone market share in China, captured 49% laptop market share in US, EV news with a auto partner, and playing ball with the new administration with the Parlor ban and Racial Inequality fund. 

I view Apple as the least at risk for taxes and anti-trust lawsuits; Amazon and Microsoft would get hit first mainly for their web hosting and using those profits elsewhere.

Joe Biden needs to pump clean energy and telehealth
I feel that. I have a feeling everyone saw the news about it too, that's why it feels worth watch, once biden announces his trillion dollar clean energy plan people are gonna stick with the only renewable energy contracts they have recently heard about and start investing, but that's obviously an autist take as well. I just like the cheap share prices that could really balloon in the next two to three years.

Can u explain to a noob what that means? I just bought shares  I doing it wrong?
I don't think anything matters anymore.  You can have a stock split and double your stock price for legit no reason
I can retire but I have a fabulous job. I get asked when are you retiring and I say I am retired. I get to do what I love.

I’ve been putting $100 per month into green ETFs since April and I’m up 200% for the year. The Georgia bump was nice, but it has always been and will continue to be a long term play.

Everyone talks about GME but also look at BBBY as well. It's basically GME for Beckys.

If you have 15+ years of dev experience, I feel like you're getting hired as a senior engineer, no matter how much you're willing to take the junior engineer pay. As another poster said, companies are adverse to hiring senior devs to junior roles for a variety of reasons.
All we know is Feb.. Unless something changes
It was just removed
SPCE 🚀🚀🚀
They've been here from the start though
I hope biden invited the CEOs of ICLN TAN BB GME X ARKK CLF VALE and many more to his event and has each one say something great about our country like Trump did near the beginning of COVID
Are you jealous that I have more money than your entire inbred family?
This sub has become so boring. All I see retards talking about either Tesla or GME.
Keep the GME rocket fueled with 🚀🚀🚀 fellas

Also, imagine being a fucking GME shortie LMAO 🐻👈🤣
Selling everything except GME and buying the next ATOM dip
If it's zero what do I do is my question.
Man nothing screams white privilege more than having 51k at 19 and thinking that’s “not much” 😂 😂
With you bro, I messed it all up today  
learnt tho

It's when you jack it with just your index finger and thumb to pretend your portfolio ain't 🦐

/DD
He’s also said that when he dies, the assets he leaves his wife will be in an S&P index. And also he’s made the bet about beating the s&p index. 

You can’t just act like he said something offhand once about it.He really believes in it as an investment.
I also bought a super OTM GME 3 weeks ago on the expectation of a massive short squeeze. Unfortunately I used a debit spread and so my gains are capped 😔 still got a 400% ROI.
We need to pump pltr back up, since it’s been downgraded 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Damn youre cool
let me guess you got shilled ICLN?
You are going to be responsible for a very nice gain for me and my family.  All bullshit aside, incredible work and faith in your own intuition. Thank you for everything you beautiful bastard.
If/when the SEC shuts wsb down for costing MM's so much money where are we meeting secretly?
I want to do volunteer work.
Might be, but its about your confidence. Being insulted day in day out while prepping coffees does something with how you think about yourself.
But does that require me to read stuff?
Buy and hold! GME gang will soon switch to BB gang 🌝🌝🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

You're late
Question is: at what point am I selling my shares? 100?
No because at this point their exposure is short on a net positive delta stack of options so they need to be long not short.
Anything can really happen tomorrow depending on what Biden says for tonight. If his stimulus is higher vs expectations all the small cap and covid hit stocks should continue to fly. If it’s not then expect tech to rebound tomorrow. Just my take. I do think Tesla is not going to break 900$ for at least a bit since the stock needs to take a breather like it did in the 400s
I bought shares of GME at 39 I can’t believe it...
Cuckery
I missed the gme boat I’m looking to fresh fuck a new ticker before the other degenerates here do it
Haha, I remember that.
Oh he will. Clean energy FOR SURE
sorry I meant 7PM eastern. 4 for the west coast (my zone)
That’s a classic, newspapers and no Covid when times were simpler and having a beeper on you was a cool thing in H.S.
"Everyone else" is just the top posters. Lots of people like you and me around here! I started with 5, then bumped it up to 75. Fuck the banks, let's make em hurt.
so tsla 1000 is what i'm hearing.
Maybe an inheritance or hard work from a job?
I've been DDing BB for a while and think it's going to grow rapidly, but I'm not sure about the long options game.
Nice work
It's a continuous contract graph. The current price is from the active contract (/ESH1) and the past prices are previously active contracts stitched on to the current one.
*Teleprompter Starts*

**My Name is Joe Buyden, and I'm running for Senate of the United Place, I am announcing an immediate Government partnership with GameStop to distribute the vaccines using Clean Energy. Also, 1400$ checks for every American Citizen.**
if it expires out of the money, as in ICLN is 35.02 or higher your contract is worthless and worth 0. If it is 35.01 or lower your broker may auto-exercise the contracts for you, give you 100 shares and subtract 3500 from your balance. This week looks like they'll be worthless though, but ya never know!
"That's why 95% of people fail at it" - you said it yourself right here, that's why I bring up index funds. Also are you really comparing a generational genius starting a tech company to a teenager trying to actively trade the stock market? Please just stop.
i just bought 7 shares with my remaining 600.
What does this mean? So on 1/14/21 he bought 50,000 of GME stock for 14.8947/share and then purchased a call of 1,000 shares (which expires on 4/16/21) for 40c/share?
you made $1.6m since your post yesterday lmao
When I interview people, I don’t look at their titles at all. It’s not part of our hiring process. We do look at how long they’ve been at their jobs, whether they’re contract or full-time, and things like that.
Im going to show this to my son when he is old enough to explain why he owes his college education to u/deepfuckingvalue at the expense of the 🌈🐻 Melvin.

Booyah

Hey Joe what do you think of TDOC?  I'm jacked to the tits on shares and ARKG calls.  Love the show.
it's a call, not a put.

you're buying a contract to purchase 100 shares of $BB for $14/share on or before 2/19. So if it goes over $14, you make money. Let's say it's $15, you exercise the option and buy those 100 shares for $14, so you're automatically up $100.

What happens more often though is that people buy and sell just the contracts without necessarily exercising them. So like I buy a contract for 1/15 9c and I pay $0.27/share ($27 total price for the contract), then the stock goes up and suddenly the ability to buy shares at $9/ea becomes more desirable so the price goes up and now that same contract is worth $0.54/share, or $54. 

so to somebody who has the capital to exercise it, they see that the stock price is currently $9.60/share, which would be $960/100 shares, or they can buy my contract for $54 and buy 100 shares for $9 per the contract = total price for them comes to $954.
superego: i don't know if i trust wsb on this $BB pump, what does blackberry even do now? better research it.

id: buy 1/22 $12C 🚀
I agree with this. I own DNN. In my opinion, a great play. They just opened a new site and Uranium gonna pop with new funding after that fucking Bill passes. Let’s get back to 2007 levels. Long term but solid.
amen
Seinfeld is not boomer humor, we all grew up watching it. Lets not forget, Jerry paper handed it and george diamond hands
Picked up 500 more shares today 🚀🚀🚀
I think Affirm will be a strong stock long term
I say halt WSB until Cramer makes his username public. Hold this shit hostage until he's outed ;)
At $50 I would be very tempted; That's a little over 180% return. Sitting at 127% gains and still holding
$TSLA is over due for a big bump.  Experience says it likes to lead not follow, so it'll be neck and neck to the moon tomorrow with GME.
BB is gonna tank harder than the Exxon Valdez, GME got roooom to run🚀
See how it goes. Next week maybe. Maybe after that.
What website is this?
So you’re closing out and taking the win, right? Or you just gonna post losses back here in a couple weeks?
At A BOY!!! Get em!!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2200 shares at 25.9 flexing in
I do this everytime before,once I have and after I buy/sell. Hahahahahaha🤑
Fuck it. I'm in.
I'm pretty sure you don't have to multiply it by laverage. You can use a app like Stinu, which you just input your account size and risk, how many pips does your SL have and it gives you the lots. Me personally, I calculate the 1% of my account, like you did, 1000$ account, 1% = 10$, then I Divide the 1% by the amount of pips in my stop loss. If I have 10 pip stop loss, 10/10 = 1$ per pip and I use a site xm pip value calculator to find out the lot size. 

There might be an easier way to do this, this is just my way of doing it. Let me know, if I was any help!
Thanks man, banking on Buyden
If you are going to buy in 5 years anyway and you can afford to now, I'd say to just do it now.
Lmao wtf. Okay

I bought September calls for what feels like nothing today.

We have nine months to see if that was a trap or not.

Hey OP where can I learn about things of this nature?
Funny i was just reading about this yesterday
We’ll see. 

Biden maybe a nothing burger and we’ll have the usual wacky monthly OpEx price action
To me it makes me think of old Nintendo games

Not one sub has ever made me laugh as much as wsb. This is the fucking best
With the huge bump this week and an increase in short volume during it. Tons of short positions are going to be forced to close. Hence the short squeeze. That’s how.
Yes, and since going public they have beat earning expectations on all their fiscal reports. But I have no clue why they’re selling
If all goes well I'll likely take at least a full year or two after retiring to slow travel (all of my travels my entire life have felt so rushed, so I want to have nearly zero day to day schedule, just go with the flow).

Then I'd like to work part time at a few jobs for just long enough that I learn enough to feel confident, such as: barista, bike mechanic, nursery/farmer, etc. 
I want to build the skills/knowledge for making great coffee, fixing my own bikes, growing a massive food garden, etc. 
Then give back all of any earnings from each job to the people who taught me those skills as a thank you gift. 

Good thing about each of those things is that they can be found in nearly every large city. So while I'm traveling all over, if I come across a really cool business/person that was hiring, I would just rent a small place nearby and learn the trade from them. Then carry on down the road. 

But once I'm ready to "settle down" I don't think I'll ever work a 'real job' ever again. I'll volunteer and do what I can to help my community, but don't want the stress of even a part time job. I wanna clean plate where only I dictate what I do each day.
SEC, here this is the guy

Have they released earning?
If something looks too confusing or complicated (wether it be a potential trade or some fancy new strategy), stay away.
Form ~~Voltron~~ Autismo
Is it too late for the BB ship?
only real concern is the currency conversion you will have to do,
once when funding and when taking out your gains.

and dont forget to negotiate for lower commissions with your broker once in a while,
do a few hundred trades, ask for better prices. they run a risk free business, you don't.
Said f it and bought 100 BB’s AH. 2/5 $15 calls mid day and 2/19 $10 calls this morning. Shits gonna moon tomorrow.
I have the audiobook version and I haven't started it. What made you bring it up here? Is it relevant to anything? Just wondering.
Today
Came to say the same! Thank you Justin!
I’m not too worried since I plan on holding. It popped on the Disney+ news and has cooled off - I think it’s going to be in a good place to load more. Those shows are still coming and even more are in the pipeline. Disney+ will continue to grow and the amount of content they are producing for known IP’s will make them a leader of the streaming wars for years to come. 

Remember there is still big recovery stock potential as well once the parks/cruises open fully. That and they’ve made the decision to hold big release (marvel) movies to try and cash in at the box office once people feel more comfortable. If they continue the success with marvel phase 4 and get the Star Wars hype back - 🚀
Very nice, thanks for building and sharing.

Thoughts & Suggestions:

1 - On straight vanilla spreads, when you enter the amount of contracts for leg #1, the 2nd leg would mirror the same # of contracts  (as usually those # of contracts are the same).  If they're different, you could still have the program make them the same but the user would just have to go in and edit the 2nd position (if that makes sense).

2-  The little "low open interest" is a cool feature..... but it doesn't show the actual OI.  Maybe you could add OI to the little dropdown box (where you input price) so we could see it along with the greeks?

3-  When adding calls or puts to an existing strategy with non-current contract prices, the contract prices revert back to the current option price.  Ex: I entered a call spread that I have.  I bought it a while ago, so my costs are different than the current market.  I then added another separate call, with a different expiration, and the original spread values have reverted back to current prices.  Similarly, even changing the strikes along the sliding scale will revert the costs back to current.   **edit:  ok after more play time on the site, this one is really quite bothersome.  If you don't change anything else, I'd strongly emphasize changing this.**  Maybe add a button inside the dropdown that allows the user to 'freeze' the price... that way you could turn on/off depending on whether you already have an existing position or you're looking at establishing a new position (and you'd want current prices).

4-  Allow for multiple expirations, not just front month and back month.  I'd suggest getting rid of that terminology altogether and simply just list the expiry months.  Some of my initial positions end up being multiple leg strategies with multiple expirations, and/or I often wonder how adding a position here & there would affect a starting position...... it would be cool to be able see them all together (like optionsprofitcalculator does, but theirs is pretty clunky as you have to pre-select the # of legs).

5-  When combining both front-month and back-month strategies together, the table/graph is only showing as far as the front-month expiry.  Obviously that's a problem when I can't see the entire strategy.  (maybe user error?)

6-  Allow the chart range to be set by the user (allows for un-equal range around multiple leg strategies).  I like the slider function, it's quick and easy, but I also like optionsprofitcalculator how you can select it manually.

&#x200B;

Fixing up some of these little things would go a long way IMHO.  Thanks for all your hard work in putting it together.  Cheers
How to be a stock prediction guy. Just make every prediction possible, then screenshot only the ones that work out.
uhh this is wsb.  They only care about tendies.

Lol. Nah it’s just another kid tryna get some karma.
Still you since you bought shares instead of calls.

So what happened to your 1/15 calls?
AMD. Ya muthas a whore
My guy, market makers will take those off your hands for 5-10 cents less than they're worth... you're gonna be okay :)
Bohooo
May I interest you with some SRPT? Mama Cathie has been holding 5x as much as she used to, and she keeps adding. Right now it's 0.8% of ARKG. It's a gene-editing play that is really undervalued, and no stock crashes 50% without at least a little rebound, so its easy buy.

Fake!!! Show the numbers from your Schwab account.. BAN HAMMMER!

My Yahoo Finance shows almost a million dollar loss, options don’t show correct on there when you have transfers
Below 100% is usually a buy for memes
I regret not picking up 100 shares of BB or getting some 2022 leaps. But i did grab some FDs expiring tomorrow, maybe itll pull a GME
I personally picked up LMT but both should do relatively well.
Its push back up, green af by pm tomorrow
Very interesting, you use them as a broker if you get an acount and they have those spreads on most pairs?
holding TLRY 14c 1/22 and 15c 1/22.... loving it
Need +40%. Good luck
Barely any theta tbh. Even with the 30C’s. When the price moves up fast the premium is <$0.10. Exercising is fine in this case.
I worked as a Manager in an coworking space/office rental space. I literally got paid to party with really cool people and help them with their company. Worked for a large corporation so pay was actually really good. Downside was I was the manager so had to collect rent, kick out, and politely discipline members. I was always on the clock too. Terrible for my social life and marriage.

I would really like to do that as an hourly employee (not manager), working part time. That would be my ideal post fire chill job. 

Also, at the building I worked at we had a building staff member who was the best, most on-it, yet good natured friendly guy I’ve ever worked with. You always knew you could count on him and customers loved him too. He was retired and only did the job so he didn’t spend all day watching TV.

It really is amazing how having f you money makes you an even better team member. I feel it in myself too.

Welcome to WSB
If you’re not in at least 1 out of GME, BB, or BBBY then idk what you’re doing.
Exactly. It can't be this way always.
Leave it in!
Nice! If my stimmy check would hurry up and get here, I'll probably pick up some of those Sept calls myself.
I missed the rocket for that 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 
I should had been retarded and YOLO 30k LMFAo but $MAC has been showing good progress 

Plus with Biden and his old ass, PUMPING WIHT STIMULUS CHECKS AND HOPE TO REOPEN EVERYTHING

Papa Elon, it's me again. If you're listening pls tweet and make Tesla jump up tm morning. Thanks.
It’s amazing to look back at the older posts and see how much doubt there was about this YOLO.  🍻 to an absolute stunner.

Just saying that AAPL just formed a bullish pattern. It might hit $134 tomorrow.
I like this too
yeah but they're probably restricted

also what are shares
BB, I honestly miss your crunchy keyboard.
he's been rolling the majority of his profits from GME calls for like 8 months, and also accumulating shares along the way
Money is money my man. It's better than no money

U really say BB stilla buy=?
Me too, but only because I'm still in the process of learning options trading lol
Without context, I’m gonna assume you’re referring to BRK.A and tell you that would be an unbelievably bad idea.
If there will be de-hedhing causing volatility and possible sell-offs/drops what time would you expect that to happen? Very close to end of day tomorrow (as I assume that calls want to be kept hedged while people still can exercise all day tomorrow)?
more to be made tmrw HEHE

You hold it until it sells or itll expire in the money. Youll get the sifferneve between the strike price and the stock price.
52 week high on BB!
2022 or 2023?
Stock goes up, flattens, news come out again.... Stock jumps again, flattens, repeat cycle. This is the NIO way.
I believe so
Same with BP. You thinking puts too? Seems like things are going WAY too well considering worldwide lockdowns.
What do you mean you’re not selling? They expire tomorrow! You better sell before they expire worthless when Market Makers dump their 15 million shares tomorrow or early Monday.
Didnt actually read any of that, but there are tons of rockets so it must be going up ... Im in
At my first job interview after graduating from a top-20 school, I sat on a dirty couch (don't ask why there was a couch in the office) and listened to an old man tell me women were terrible with numbers and he hoped he wasn't making a mistake hiring me for a bank consulting position. People like him make women scared of money. I went on to get an MBA, worked in IT at two different banks, saved my money, bought some houses, and now get to stay at home reading reddit all day and trading stonks with my daughter.
i bought more at 39 . tomorrow is the big day
\*Joe (Yo, buy then!) Biden
I think it's run its course. There are others to focus on for now...
That’s not the worst habit, I to sell when I’m OTM. Not getting greedy has served me well in this casino. Missing out on a little more tendies is better than option expiring worthless every time.
Sry I found a few more 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I heard the same thing about 40
Only 4 shares :( I will do better
No wonder you’re so bullish on twitter LMAOOOOOOOO
Sorry bro. Asshats galore in here. Hire a financial advisors and have him set you up for retirement. I’m doing it now and it costs me 1% of my portfolio. Don’t take advice from Reddit.
Well it immediately dropped AH but is now recovering to near even so probably more bullish than a typical flat AH

Go read a book
Can we push BB to 5 year highs now!?
What date?
Lol I'm 22 work in oil and have about this amount I use in stocks. You must have inherited, but the earlier you start, the better

Lol why are people saying Buyden will pump BB? why the fck would he care about BlackBerry lol, only thing me might pump is clean energy and even that might not happen
The S&P500 and total stock market are completely safe. Imagine ARKK or ICLN being the new standard that people benchmark their portfolios against lmao
Papa Elon has a BB.
I am trying to rebalance my portfolio. I currently have two index funds. 70% total market and 30% total international market. I will retire in 8 years. Should I add a bond index fund? Should I rebalance to 80% total market and 20% total international? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks

If you're consistently able to take profits, then you're doing great, regardless of whatever profit you're leaving on the table.  How are you losing money and just breaking even, then?  How are you hedged?

Fathership ended with Trump. Buyden is daddy now.
Was holding BB 1/15 calls for a while and sold them this morning for .02. they were up at .45 today.
That's a 33% drawdown. Not very minor in my opinion...

Remindme! 72 days ARKX
Yea I think it’s aiming for 1.2100 might even try to make it’s way to 1.20550 but I don’t know if it’ll touch it. I think tomorrow will be bearish as well and then maybe sometime next week start making its way back up.
No, his call will be from his broker and he will say “yes sell that boomer Apple stock you retard”
Don’t worry you’ll probably have another opportunity in like 10-30 years ☺️
You’re more than welcome to leave.
Dude that's sick. Ride it all out. Million or nothing
Thanks buddy ❤️
BB still worth it?
It is 100% because of WSB I even thought about buying BB or GME. Both off DDs. For BB I have 7.5c 1/21/22 because I thought this was got to be a much longer play.
Got fucked in the ass by Tesla back in September, lost 78% of my account, finally got back to even and far into the green and told myself I would let my account be more than 15% options 

Currently have 80% of my account in options and feeling like a true bulltard
Vanguard
I saw a really convincing post about how GME only trade(at 20) at 1X it’s revenue, whereas most companies trade at multiples. With Cohen’s leadership this could be some deep fucking value.
Bought 5 2/12 10.5c and this AH activity has me rock hard
10.5c 1/15 & some shares, get in before it’s too late
AMD ITM calls for tomorrow, 1/22 and 1/29. Stupid undervalued here🚀🚀

Sell, buy shares with half and roll the rest to Feb
Ive heard a lot of talk about the gamestop bubble though, the 5 year chart looks scary af too its in need of a big pullback

Under 40 take the risk you have time to make up for it, over 40 take the risk dont be a pussy
It’s easy. Just look for a date and strike you can afford and hit buy
Well my team is small and there's no guarantee that I will grow by title in my current role since there isn't a robust hierarchy - so who knows.
I remember my old BB.

A lot of wishful thinking....

Shut up retard
BB isnt really heavily shorted
With GME, profit and vigilantism are codependent
I need someone to explain why GME options have horrible bid/asks... Isn't this a super hype stock with a ton of cash flowing in? Where is the liquidity?
Why wouldn’t you roll out to a higher strike at this point
do you have concession speach?
Thanks in no small part to your conviction I’ve turned my portfolio from down year over year to up a considerable amount, thank you sir.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Me too.  Good luck tomorrow!
Gonna keep holding strong.
It didn’t even budge when trump announced the partnership the first time so idk why it would now. Market’s irrational as fuck though so who knows.

Most of us didnt know BB was still a company. Idk what they even do now
Gain porn gunna be sexy too
I'm assuming this will be historical in terms of squeezing. Could be wrong tho.

So I bet many, many analysts are paying attention and figuring out ways to anticipate this stuff.
After partnering with gravity powered Nikola and changing their logo to MySpace word art, they released a CGI video of a quadcopter car. These are all bullish signs.

Going out to buy a new BB right now!  Do they still make phones?
When u need money
there is nothing like FB. Period.

what u did was retarded. your gains do not justify your action (Resulting bias). You just turned out be a lucky retard.
The people that spout this line are hardly value or factor investors. Just fidgety investors that have no patience and are looking for a dopamine hit.

Ended up buying 5 shares of $GME today @$34.26. And 7 shares of CCIV @ $17.20.

Not much, but I'm tired of watching the train leave me.
Hoooooooy fuck BB
I’d say prob SQ just because I think they jumped on it earlier, I’m pretty sure a while ago they bought like $50M in Bitcoin but I’m not sure what percentage of that was for facilitating their crypto business with customers and what percentage was just a hold as an asset.  PYPL going heavy into it also, can’t remember if it was from the last earnings call or an interview I saw with the CEO but it seems like the main benefits for PayPal from the crypto stuff isn’t really from selling crypto and making a markup on it, it’s more like people who use crypto on our platform start using our platform a lot more for other stuff and we make money off that. Sort of like how prime users buy more stuff on Amazon. I would imagine this is probably the case for Square also but PayPal is in with the CCP in China (first foreign firm with full ownership of their payments business in China) so that usually results in good things for investors. I have more PYPL than SQ personally but that’s just because I got in earlier than SQ.

My opinion on Facebook is mixed. I actually just sold my shares after a little over five years to put into other stuff this morning. Good company it seems and it seems like it is the backbone of the Internet, I like what you’re doing with VR / virtual stores and everything but I was just more interested in other stuff. FB is cash machine though, and Zuck has it humming nicely for now :) 

That’s fair, everyone has their own strategy that works for them and you should for sure stay mostly inside your comfort zone :)

I sold the $9 put and bought the $10 call, and got paid $8 per contract for feb 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
you think we get 100?
You have to be brain-dead to buy tlry over apha right now. Compared to merge pricing, apha is at a discount. And if the merge falls through? Apha is the far more valuable of the two anyways. 

Fucking get it together boys

so those arent rockets huh...
That’s great, but everyone is just spamming GME and it has become annoying
Can we get better memes?
I don't understand how Boomers listening to Cramer's pumps are any more enlightened than us wading through the huge amount of BS here for solid DD.
Hoping for a follow up review after tomorrow :)
I've been doing that for a month. Get puts on the way down too, double dip.
No idea. Just FOMO'd because I missed out on GME. If WSB can do to BB what it did to GME, then yes, still a buy
17 here 😭
People are shitting on you but honnestly I think your process of learning from your mistakes will take you further than most people here
Buy LEAPs for easy gains.  We are talking Hugh Jackman on steroids for Wolverine gains.  INTC is absolutely dicked and AMD is primed for the next 3-5 years.
You plan on selling these calls tomorrow, right? At what price?
I own ACES
Nah, 14 is the strike price, depending on his premium it might have to reach 15+ to break even. He won't buy the shares., instead he'll just sell the option so some other retard will buy it.
Sarcasm. But yeah don't.
I love how GME after hours moves like it's fucking midday
Wait for gme to clam down and go all in. Fucking send it and double your money this year. Then double it again next year.

I am holding, all BB needs is a price target from Needham, another deal other and Amazon and bam 30 dollar stock atleast.  🚀🚀🚀🚀

I feel like I'm the only person in my company who declines meetings because they fall on a holiday.  
We use Outlook, and every year we are sent the company holiday calendar to download into it.  If I somehow forgot (and like u/toodleoo77, I am not likely to forget) and tried to schedule a meeting on a holiday, the system tells me there's a conflict.  It's not hard.

They closed all the locations when pandemic started, for about 3 months. Then they opened with reduced capacity in states that allowed it. In some states, with renewed cases, they were closed again. They still are closed in Oregon and California. They had to reduce number of bay that can be open, additional expenses of cleaning/sanitizing/installing physical barriers between bays etc. For evidence, just google, their website will tell you Sacramento and Hillsboro are still closed. I think all UK locations are still closed. My source: few friends are/were managers at top golf

if youre regretting paperhanding, you either didnt have a plan to exit, or dont believe in the position enough to stick to your exit strategy.

selling early isnt a bad thing if youre locking in profits. if youre consistently selling earlier than youd like, change your exit strategy.

Stocks!  Invest in stocks!  

Maybe wait just a bit.  Things seem very high right now.  May or June.  

REITs might be good too.  Even soft commodities might be good this year.

Vice stocks. Booze, fancy cars, cruises.  I'd skip airlines, personally.  Hydrogen power.  Don't invest in utilities or anything like Facebook or any oil company.

Don't get suckered into municipal bonds.  They all suck.  Cities are going broke.

Gme calls tomorrow?
Although this would still be to our benefit as holders, they'd just ride with us the squeeze to hedge or potentially even profit. There was some high volume of ridiculous of another 40k 55C for tomorrow (lmao) at less than a dollar today. Say they cover first, price goes up, and then their calls also moon? Not sure of the math tho, I'm assuming covering the short position either way is super expensive tho. Either way I think everyone that's in wins, until the stock eventually corrects.

They're not the same. I feel like XAUUSD has less chop and more defined movements. If it's going to go down it will go down for a few candles. If it will go up it will go up a few candles. GBPUSD feels like it has quite a bit of chop even during trends that can make me drop out of trades earlier than I'd like. In that regard, I prefer XAUUSD. However, spreads on GBPUSD are so low I have confidence to put stop trades when I'm confident what direction the candles will go and I can be in and out of a trade in seconds for a few pip profit. It can be harder to that on XAUUSD since you have to make up for the spread first.

>	The real risk for all of us is a prolonged drawdown period, where instead of volatile swings down and back up, we just slowly bleed down over a multi-year time frame, and then slowly climb back up over the next few years. Again, this hasn’t happened since 2000, but I wouldn’t rule it out as an impossibility (though I doubt that it will happen this year since we’re in a zero percent interest rate environment for the near-term).

Yep.  Lots of dumb confidence due to the extraordinary rebound we’ve had.

The 2001-2005 stretch was awful. Everyone and their grandmother hated equities and it took almost 7 years for the S&P500 to reach its peak again, only to go into the great financial crash-drawdown a few months later.


This whole decade has been something else for equities.

Sold my BB 1/15 10c for .02 this morning. Dammit.
I've not looked into it intensely but I'm still surprised by the email response since american investors don't need to have those credentials in order to invest in it. Trading 212 add stocks/etfs pretty often so they may or may not add it onto their platform eventually. I would like to add the etf to my portfolio at some point though so hope that someone knows something that we don't

This is my current job but I take home a decent salary and can retire in 10 years. I also work for the Air Force so we have a weeded group of people and rarely have homeless or mentally ill people come in and the ones who do act right since they are on a military base. Most of the time I love my job. I might stay a little longer until my GF catchs up and can retire as well. Let me know if you have any questions. I would be happy to answer them.

The best investors are those that can afford to lose. Money loses value and it’s just a game. I’m no where near to this level and will never be. This is like poker and I enjoy the game and study, but I know the best guy at table is the one that has no fear. I always fear because luck can mean a month worth of work is blown by corruption or manipulation I didn’t see coming. Take it for what you will.

I keep seeing some health (and others) stocks going up and up an incredible percentage each day. I find it absolutely baffling, the earnings are non-existant, awful ratios, they're bleeding money and yet they get 30% gains in 6 hours.

Has the market ever been this way? 

Is the future earning/prospects really that strong of a sentiment than overrides financial logic?

Makes me FOMO, even got a little bit in TLRY for the law and politics side (full speculative ofc), and the gains in a day razed some long stocks I'm holding.

Read through his post history, literally nearly a year back he's been on GME. A true WSB God.
Buy shares you fucking autist
I mean it did power the Arab Spring.  If things get any more dicey here might be a business model there...
Its going to take more than a few quarters for INTC to catch up.  People buying that turd on the new CEO announcement... oof.  I'm guessing that's dead money for a long while.
someone give me a surefire 200% play
How do you guys deal with FOMO? I had shares in BB and pussied out after the post ER mega dip.
Thanks nathan
yessir
yeah i made a post about investing AGAINST the hype. I personally wouldn't touch the EV / green energy sector right now. but i could be completely wrong. i also wouldn't touch Chinese stocks which is pushed by reddit 24/7.

I like the recovery plays far more. i feel the market is still out of balance due to COVID. (when everyone just pilled in tech out of fear) and its going to rebalance again and i want in the beaten down stocks before it happen.

I went all in CCL back in march @ $9 and sold at $23. (risky i know but i had to take the chance, once in a lifetime opportunity)

i then dumped most of that $$ into XOM on Dec. 31st (timed that one well) 

a day or two later i added ET (this was recommended to me by a co-worker who is about 25 years older than me after i told him about me XOM play). 

He made about 2million off of "ARWR" a few years ago so i just kind of took his advice on this one TBH. But its a recovery play and i was already in XOM so wasn't to big of a shift in my strategy.

&#x200B;

Time will tell i guess.
Only 500k a ticket
It's not looking as early now...
It will peak at 69, then gap up to 420.
I saw other talking DD about BB and did a little research saw they are way down and trending up. Seems like a good buy. So then I start browsing the options for days far out and close to find a good price I'm able to afford to loose. If happen to find these stupid cheap contracts and it's close to matching the timeframe of a uptrend I buy. Figured that this shit has to be above $10 by next year. I'm probably screwing myself because there are the greeks which hell you know what timeframe to buy but I don't speak greek yet.
You were thinkin about us while you fucked her, though :3
Valhalla awaits brother. WSB is in control now. I started my Robinhood 6 weeks ago and have almost made 10k.

It's explained in the link that I provided.

The net income is reduced by depreciation of the properties - one reason why it's not used to gauge a REIT. FFO adds depreciation back to net income and removes gains on sales of depreciated properties.

A stock-for-stock merger occurs when shares of one company are traded for another during an acquisition. When, and if, the transaction is approved, shareholders can trade the shares of the target company for shares in the acquiring firm's company. These transactions—typically executed as a combination of shares and cash—are cheaper and more efficient as the acquiring company does not have to raise additional capital.

It's doing well and the underlying has only gone from like $49.5 to what it has now.

I bought just before that correction, so am a little wary and safe with it.

I don't mind giving a few % top end for that nice lower breakeven point.

How about ATH instead

Buying more TSM. Shit's gone up 30% in two months and has a rock-solid foundation to go up more.

This isn't a meme stock play or a game of EV chicken, this is the 9th largest company on the NYSE positioning itself to manufacture every high-performance CPU and smartphone on Earth.

Yeah it is odd, and I wish it worked being all in on icln. But you can’t really meme a global etf unfortunately
The answer to "is this taxable" is basically always yes.
how sure are you all about GME reaching 45 lmao
Long as we keep it up. I'm selling other positions to double down

I have a good feeling about SHMP as well. Let’s hope it pays off.

Good luck on your next play, Melvin
I would argue that the short squeeze is valuable for him and GME. Bringing way more exposure to the brand. Ultimately leading to a nice little offering to raise capital. Overall great publicity if they want people to buy in on their plans.
whats your position? thinking about hopping in
nope just hibernating. you will notice if tsla dies
Biden better come out with a PS5 and XBOX tonight and thank GME for all they have done
TLRY just cant go positive AH
I’m trying to find an independent source for those very otm calls

Market opened and I got wiped out instantly man I didn’t stand a chance 

It was the day Tesla hit ATH in frankfurt, thought I was about to be fuckin rich and woke up to it like -15%
ENB.TO has (or is about to) hit it’s resistance on the 1year chart. Tomorrow if it breaks through I’ll buy if it dips I’m waiting till $40 to buy

Will you guys accept illegal immigration? I think I can do that one.
He is halfway right; this isn't even short squeeze prices, this is just the lower limit of fair value, but not taking into account the beneficial changes from having Cohen et al om board. I've said it before and I will say it again, this stock should be at very least 80 without short squeeze

The buying opportunity of a lifetime for big oil might have just ended with the recent runup. My XOM went from almost $40 to over $50 since Jan 1. It's still a good time to buy. This is a buy and hold forever stock. The bull case for oil and gas isn't war, it's Asia (especially China) and it's the decline of coal.
Fuck it. Missed GME....150 shares of BB ready to head to the moon!

Time in the market always beats timing the market. My suggestion would be etfs throughout time until you’re able to learn and read more to get a better understanding of what you’re preferences are

This cost me a cpl $k to learn... Think I have a grasp on it now. Think of it like this: you can buy and sell options like the rights to a bet, "I bet you $XYZ will be $$$ by ##/##  date". If you made that bet today and things started going your way as you approach the strike date, you'd be confident you are going to win your bet. You'd be ITM (in the money). 
Now you could either keep that bet all the way until the strike date or you could sell it to someone else. They'd pay you a premium for the rights to your bet since it already looks likely that you'll win it. Of course the same would be true in the opposite direction if stocks ever went down, but luckily they don't.

The natural flow will be for dealers to buy a bit on stable price throughout the day as all the in the money calls have delta for to 1. Price rises on that. At some point, people will begin to dump their calls to dealers. I don’t know when that happens enough to offset the buy but certainly by the afternoon and absolutely at 330 NY time.
Such a bizzare stock

Can I have 50k pls or adopt me
>Its in r/stocks so i assumed it was about the shares

You're explicitly in a comment chain discussing the underlying value of a company as a whole. You may be in a subreddit called stocks, but this discussion is about the company that the stock represents. 

Reading comprehension is apparently a rarer skill than I thought.
you don’t have to buy back shares when a put expires, genius

Dingling, you’re link confirms exactly what I said.
"best run" means absolutely nothing in this market unfortunately. It's almost entirely speculative now. Companies that are well run but relatively unknown just don't do nearly as well as popular companies. Look at fucking doordash, it's the biggest crock of shit ever and it just keeps going up.
Out $107. Not that expensive for 5.5 hours' entertainment, I guess.

Ok so you good in your case. People are buying those calls now. If the stock craters (which it wont) your calls will be worthless whether you can sell em or not. 

Theoretically if you really needed to get out. Start selling onesies and twosies at a time. Work your way down from the position. Maybe exercise 1 at a time, sell the position, the. Exercise another.
So who is reaching out to Melvin Capital so we can mod them for their epic losses?

I made picked LMT and made an extensive DCF. Based on my dcf the fair value is around 430-ish, with the bull case being around $480. I think what a lot of people missed in the statements is that they are going to report around 16billion in the next few years due to the change in fas/cas

what are you thoughts about exercising the deep 4/19 calls,  aside from not wanting to overweight on the shares?

I have 120 like you around the same basis, and they pretty much have no time value, it's all intrinsic, given that they aren't going to do a dividend anytime soon, seems like if you can afford to, why not take the stock?
In for 850 today at 9.2. TD was acting up all day, glad I got the order in before close
I don't understand the $BB love. My company used to use a secure email app called Good. Good was acquired by BlackBerry, so the app became BlackBerry email. It was horrible to use, incredibly unintuitive. You had to install several companion apps on your phone just to use BlackBerry email. Even though the companion apps didn't do anything, if you deleted them from your phone the email would stop working. My company switched to Outlook for iPhone/Android a year later and everyone was thrilled.

Did she get the original 1200$ 

If you paid taxes last few years and got direct deposit returns it should direct deposit to you account. 

If not you get a paper check. Some are required to go on irs.gov to input up to date info to claim check. 

If she didn’t get the original 1200, it will be a credit to her on 2020 taxes when she files. She will essentially get an extra 1200 back in tax returns. It is called the economic impact rebate when filing. However she can go on IRS.gov and get new 600$ issued and or see what he status is.

Repetition, they're all the same after a while. Perspective, you start to realize other things are much more important.
To split portfolio or not to split portfolio? I'm looking at SP500 benchmark and it seems to be outperforming Vanguard 2065, but I'm concerned that a lot of that is due to the Covid boom where everyone that had some money made money.

30ish; US; 55k/yr; objective is ultimately 3.3M; no set "need before" date; willing to risk more than average; currently \~14k total in vanguard 2065 split between 401k and roth, 4k crypto, 3k liquid; no debt, no physical assets

they don’t have to. the only result will be a tad bit of gamma squeeze if MM’s put/call ratio is skewed towards puts

WSB is why the internet is so important for the small guy. For centuries the big guy has profited from an information advantage. Now, WSB in essence is an answer to that. Gordon Gekko rightly said the most important commodity is information 💯

Looking at 50% up currently. Been holding 761 shares at 10$ since before the crash. I had several panic attacks. Freaking pleased now tho. Current environment looks like a melt up in a lot of places, I'm looking to hold on for a bit, and if shit goes south.... this is still gonna be trading at 20$/share in the next 24 months.
the faster you want the money, the sooner its all gone.
Thank u bb

Damn. Thats impressive. Appreciate the info
The gme stocktwits message board is infested w wsb Redditors lmao
Feel like if Buyden doesn't pump clean energy, ICLN might dump 10%+ tomorrow, kinda worried...
I say yes
LFG!!
Thank the gods.  I thought about buying the short squeeze a hundred times, and never pulled the trigger.  Then it happened.  It actually happened, and BIG!  Fortunately, I FOMOed in end of day yesterday and got some fat tendies in my lunchbox this morning.
Hindsight is 20/20. Virtually everything I sold at a loss this year rocketed after but none as fast as Minerco.. I sold it because I was impatient and it started running 5 min after the trade. That one hurt...
Actually, i put in an order for this but it didn't fill by day's end. What is a decent revision that is close that would have a higher chance to fill. I know, pretty retarded question...
BB opening over $10 tomorrow with ease
Im 29 only got 10k lol.
I’m not selling til 100 minumum
You idiots are a lost cause none of ever have the awareness to buy something when it’s red in anticipation,

Half of you wait til a stock is up 80% and literally gamble what you have.
I sold mine for a mere 400% gain... could have hit 1000% had I held all day or into tomorrow...

Fair assesment, i have been holding Pfizer since March, and I picked up Moderna in August (sold in December). Looking at the Moderna growth and locked in gains, it never seemed like Pfizer went through that same growth throughout the year (granted pfizer has 4 times the market cap of moderna so the same growth wouldn't be expected). It just seems like there's so much more room for Pfizer to be a big player in covid response now and in the future, and the stock price doesn't seem to reflect that.
> Tell me again how bitcoin will remain unregulated lmao

Regulation requires control of the controller and since no one controls btc (except maybe the semi-obvious 51%+ mining share China holds) there's no way to regulate it outside of record keeping for users within the states. 

Really the only legislation they could do is steep tax penalties, unless the gov. wants to break out more Patriot Act interpretations out on exchange owners like they did with E-gold, but even then, American's will just flip on a VPN and use another exchange. 

At the end of the day, this article actually supports the argument of why regulating BTC is useless. Some blockchain analysts discovered this connection. If it was supposed to be top-secret, they didn't do a good job. I imagine the US Gov has quite the blockchain analysis team as well. 

This really is no different than someone next-day shipping cash to all these folks. Really criminality boils down to whether or not the recipients conducted themselves unlawfully with the funds however the timing of the article pretty much prevents them from 'accidentally' forgetting to report the donation on their 2020 taxes. 

To me, it looks like everything working the way it should. Bonus tinfoil: The US Gov likes the idea that people think BTC is anonymous and that certain unnamed 'privacy coins' are "untrackable" because it lures criminal into a false sense of security along a web of documentation and irrefutable timestamps as they conduct their criminal enterprise. 

Bro I am so stoned I can't even remember why I wrote this up just gonna end this one here with a shout out to MNUCHIN for picking up the beer pong mess from yesterday and friendly reminder that if you ain't shortin, you ain't snorting. #yoloswag4jesus

Cool story. I’ve been trading as well since the pandemic started and my story is a lot like yours. I lost a lot of money and even gave up a few times last year. What turned everything around for me was researching the company that I would be swing traded and coming up with a plan (e.g. purchase price, exit plan, catalysts, risk %, etc.). I literally have a spreadsheet showing each investment along with notes and my plans so that at the end of the day I can go back to my notes and be able to stick to my plan. In just two months I’ve grown my account by about the same percentage. Good luck!
Why do you assume calls being excersised? My fear is alot of ppl just taking profits, so the shares that were secured for these calls are getting sold by their dealers again
My theory: those posts are just karma grabs

I don’t support Twitter because jack dorsey looks homeless. Zuckerbot is peak evolution meanwhile.
Excellent post u/fieryskyes.  Given how far and fast we've traveled already, it seems easy to lost sight of the fact that shorts are staring at a really challenging math problem--and paying more and more to prolong the inevitable.  This has always been one of the most unique investment opportunities that many of us may see in our lifetimes.  And now the fire has been lit and shorts are running for the exists or attempting to blow out the flames themselves with more shorting, which just adds more oxygen if they can't push down a reversal.  Some patience will definitely be rewarded it seems to me, as this fire already seems a bit out of control. 

It sounds like we may have some head winds tomorrow with options expiration, so could be a good day to enter and for the action to consolidate a bit.  But given those headwinds and the likely anticipation by shorts that they might be able to exit without further damage, if we still see a major spike on volume, it seems like we could go parabolic quickly.  

Isn't this fun?  And this, dear Rocket Children, is why you never ever dig in on a short position in a heavily shorted stock--especially when a brilliant activist investor is engineering a tech-centric turnaround while buying up the float...
get a new name and see if that helps.
I'm not well versed enough in that interaction to confidently say itll have an impact. It's also not so much a squeeze inducing event but rather a buy-pressure event

But he had a clear reason. PS5 and XBox Series X. That’s been his reasoning from the beginning, and he was completely correct.
Loaded 110c 3/19 at close today. Looks like I’m first in line to be pegged by Lisa.
FOMO is real with most of these autists
K. 15c 1/15
It’s crazy because BB is actually a fantastic play. They completely transformed their business.. protect user data now.. partnership with Amzn for data monitoring. Big jpm call Tmorrow.. 1:15... stay tuned
Thanks for info.  missed that.
My money is stuck in PLTR and I am missing all these rally 😥
Hasn’t it already squeezed? If not, I am DD’ing
u/randomtinky What do you think about this stock?
Seriously. Made some good money this week.
Realistically I expect it to get back up to $12 soon, maybe $15 in a few months depending on sentiment and earnings
Buy at the peak
He’s implying tomorrow will be bigly red
Spy why why why
My 3.64 rounds up to 4.
If you figure it out let me know. It’s pretty consistently around .65. Has to be a reason.
What will GME to tomorrow
Wouldn't whoever bought them be exercising them anyway?
My 100 BB shares I bought ~10 minutes ago are already up 2%. Get in while you can. Buy calls. Buy shares. Sell covered calls. Whatever floats your boat.
It's up 50% the last month. Have some fucking patience, it's a great long term hold. Sit back and relax
Counterpoint: buy thousands of dollars worth of options
::
Oh does Robinhood auto-exercise if it needs to?
Personally I would have closed the Jan call and rolled the Feb call up to 35 strike. Not a huge fan of WFC but you would take some money off the table while staying exposed to the Biden speech and the potential for 10yr yield to keep increasing.

The lesson you learned today should be:

Every time you trade a single-stock option, you should know how many earnings events it captures and when they fall. Every time.
Aged like a fine wine this post did. They probs really hate wsb now
$57?
BB will trade $20+ by then
I did this with a few hundred dollars on a BB call expiring tmrw and sold 1hr later for 120%. Thursday’s before option expiration days —my new favorite days. 

Gotta train up to your level. 2000 next time.
If the paper hands fuck off??? We thoomin 🚀

You have to have strength and hold. It’s better also to buy on the dips. I bought MGNI after the short report and now I’m sitting on a profit after a few weeks of holding
Sweet! Thanks man. This is the kinda story you want to see and enjoy.
Should I get out of CCIV and pour it into BB? Bought in right as the Lucid Motors rumor was taking off, 1 CCIV share is like 1.7 BB shares
I'm on gme gang now but still im calling out retards like you. You don't get banned for being a bear get that through your fetus lurker noob smooth brain

Holy shit bro! Good job 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Thanks!
37% of ICLN holdings are in US leaving 63% in other countries. How do I keep faith in the green energy of that 63%???

Nope.
7:15 EST
I’d go at least March for $115s personally but I’m slightly less risky than most on here.  Do some call spreads if you are concerned about price. If playing February ideally the lower end of the spread is 100 or 105
The coolest😎
I work with these technologies on a daily basis and I can say that CDNA is not going to be enough.
AMD might compete in that segment at some point but that can't possibly happen until at least 2025. I don't think AMD is after that segment right now anyway

Bought 5 BB 02/05/2021 9.50 C today. If only I had more cash 😔
Better 🚀 soon I’m holding some 1/22 calls that took a beating today.

Stare at my PLTR shares and cry.
Amen. It's pretty hard to see your picks tank but if you do a bit of DD and feel good about the company, you won't sell even if you're down 20-30% one day. Learned that the hard way in the beginning.
My god... It's beautiful
Probably. Just so boring lately.
Do it
Don’t have the short squeeze . Just looking at y’all gains like what if

Not really, It's mostly instagram these days, but guess who owns that.
Finally activated Robinhood Gold and bought 500 shares of GME and 500 of BB today on margin.

Time to print some money?
so mad at the credit union right now... congrats!
I love it. Riding this {censored} wave is like free money. Watch {censored} go from 50% of MRST mkt cap to 99% EOY
Good move. I was only in shares. Selling way out of the money calls against the shares. Basically free money. APHA gonna double this year

That’s called bag holding my dude.
There's a hedge fund out there holding 1 billion GME shares that has been watching this sub for months and waiting until tomorrow pm to dump their shares.
Double in a week?
Dudes made millions off this play.  Wish I was him too
damn imagine having parents who could loan 10k
Depends how OTM the put strike is. Closer the strike is to the actual share price the more shares the MM will short to hedge the put they sold. When share price =strike the MM will need to be short about 50 shares for every put contract sold (contracts being worth 100 shares). If the put is deep ITM the MM will need to be short 100 shares for every put contract they sold.

Something like that anyway.

So I think... net unhelpful to the squeeze as the MM would need to short in order to hedge themselves.

I wouldn’t sweat these other comments. It’s not out of the ordinary to lose money your first year of day trading. It’s “market tuition”. If you plan on doing this for the long run. As long as you keep learning and start seeing consistent Green Day’s then you’ll be on your way.

On what?  The place where you stop for games?
Whoops edited that, 57k. Im not that good😂
Well done brother
Damn son, what a legend
Yeah, I feel you on that one. Work always takes the priority, meanwhile my apartment gets messy which makes it even harder to relax. Riding my bike is my therapy, I find it meditative to go out and forget the world exists for a few hours.
I have some calls. You should post positions or ban.
One thing about Gamestop ive never seen mentioned here is the Pokemon cards. If you haven't noticed (or been out of the game since you were a kid) Pokemon Cards have legit boomed over the last year, pretty much since lockdown started. Price for cards, especially the old ones have 100x with the rise of youtube ppl opening packs. Gamestop literally sells so much fucking pokemon online (i know, ive purchased a ton, and a lot of it sells out super quick) so this has to also be a nice bump to keeping them alive.

&#x200B;

Next time you're even at Walmart, check the pokemon aisle, it will be cleaned out along with the rise of sporting cards.

Anyway, GME to the fucking MOON
lmao all time high. 52 week high.
Baba to the 🌙 🚀
So from 2018 to pre-covid, they were already on a steady decline. I could see a situation where they reach those 2018 numbers again, but that is just a positive guess. For the short-term, they'll probably get back to April 2020 numbers.
Excited to watch Biden’s speech together with everyone on this sub and post 🚀🚀🚀s

No, unlike with a hardship withdrawal, they deliberately do not ask. Was like a back door stimulus package. You just has to check a box saying you were negatively effected and believe you meet the criteria.
This is more of a r/canadianInvestor question tbh.

As a fellow retarded Canadian, I have both a personal and TFSA account and trade in both. I do dumb day trades in my personal and just hold on the stuff in my TFSA. 

From what I've heard you only get audited if they consider that your day trading in your TFSA is a business and main source of income. That being said I haven't read up on it too much.

GME 50 TOMORROW RED HOT 🔥🔥🔥
Be mindful that diagonal spreads lose money if the underlying stock moves too favorably too fast. Your short contract can outstrip your gains on the LEAP and even chew through your premium in extreme cases.
Older investors can hate but times are changing. Can people make a few extra bucks off of stocks because of memes? Damn right. Are some people just taking massive bets and throwing it all in on a stock because social media pumps it up? Damn straight. 

They wouldn’t be scrutinizing the younger generations if they themselves lived in our era. If warren buffet was our age and became wealthy with what we now, I guarantee that his advice would be different. 

Buffett “I made smart plays by listing to retards and autist individuals off of the most well put together subreddit this world has ever see #wallstreetbets”

Theta is huge on those. Had to be a day play. I got in at 1.5, sold at 2.25. Might do the same tomorrow.
This a thousand times. So GME peaked at 38 yesterday and missed. So made an autistic hypothesis it will peak at 43 today and swing the shares at dip. The 🌈🐻 in me 🧻🙌 at 38 when it started peaking again to 43!!! Dont worry though, gonna buy in again at dip (grabs callculator)

Guess who straddled GME at 39.50 and guess where it’s at right now 😎
I doubt it. After market is still holding pretty strong and there are tons of shorts to be unwound. 

There new support is probably around the $36-$38 mark, and I can’t see if falling through that. 

Tomorrow we should hopefully break $40, creating a new floor.
No idea; can’t play anything for long.
I made 3k from a short rocket ride yesterday. Fuck it, I said, and I put the profit immediately into 55c for next week. Go big or go home.

(my 4500 shares are happy either way though)
Rookie numbers bump it up
I swear worst feeling in the world is being up 100%+ only to later close for a loss
Also: what happened to Canoo... seems like 8% minus is a lot for that it should be so good apparently
I'll buy 50s at open for you
Nah brah, puts expiring worthless tomorrow, it gon’ fly again.
BBBBBRRRRRRRRRR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍
we goin to 50 tomorrow
I dont see any bullish patterns. You mean it might bounce from the uptrend line?
A little further support to this theory is that last major volume price explosion was October 8th, a Thursday. On that day the price of GME went from $9 to $13 on a volume of 70M (which was a record for GME) and on the 9th it hit a high of $14.80 before selling off down to $12. If memory serves the selling didn't take place until around noon, and the total drop from high to low was around 20%, but the total move from Wednesday's close to Friday's high was around 70%. We've had a roughly 125% move from Tuesday's low to today's high, I would expect that if we drop it will be down to around $30.  


I plan on picking up 0DTE $40p tomorrow, ideally if it gets to $45, which is also where I'll be selling a few more of my April calls.  


Current position: 15 Apr 20c, 200 shares.
I know I did 💰

Congrats dude. 

Awesome gains.
That’s why I took them today ITM. I’m about 30 cents from breakeven for tomorrow and I’m gonna roll them into 1/29 calls after that.

Positions:

50 87c 1/22

And I’ll roll the 88c to 90c 1/29 tomorrow.

Yo you bois mind pumping SRPT and show Moma Cathie some love, gene editing is the fkg future and my boy SRPT is at a 50% discount. Remember when Cathie bought FSLY when it dipped like 40%, and then it zoomed to an all-time high, she's doing it again with SRPT, she is buying like no tomorrow. Idk I think you should look into it if you like to buy on dips, there are not many of them right now.
BB just hit an all time high in after-hours! My wife’s boyfriend can smd 😈
Whats "shares", precious?
Multi trillion dollar bill. Missing a few trillion.
facts down big
BS. There aren’t that many GME shares
Glad I’m out the only one buying in at $38. The sub has fully corrupted me in 12hours. My wife is going to murder mer
Badass, I made 10% on HP today 6k
I sold the put, IV is high and I wouldn't mind getting assigned at a discount to today's prices.
I'm still holding, shit's going to 54 tomorrow
I'm not saying the democrats will cause a market crash, but hotels/airlines/etc.. might drop due to a possible lockdown. Wall street knows this and will take advantage of it. The dems are more likely to lockdown the country if there is a need for it, they have the house and the senate itll be easier for them to do it. With a mutation spreading, people skeptical about vaccines and so on I think it's a possibilty that we'll need a second lockdown.
In 3 days, went from $3.1mm to $7.3mm, massive gains.
Should I buy 4k worth of $BB stocks now or wait til market open? Will probably pick up a couple calls as well
lol for now :S but oooh boy tmr we can see big movement.
I’m hoping we get an update tomorrow or sometime soon, because I would personally love to see the numbers for short interest
Looks like a bullfrog harmonica crab pattern to me
PLTR the seed now and watch it grow over time. It's a long game for that one. I'm in 400+ shares of PLTR, and I know it's going to go slow.
I think it’s more likely they break out
what do you mean 21.5 calls?
This guy knows how to enjoy life
Fubo is shorted as fuck and is a legit business as far as I can tell
Oh boy....if he does...then lol
My body is ready
the stim plan just dropped [1.9T stim plan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-package-details-checks-unemployment-minimum-wage.html)
As a 🐻, I got my first calls on GME today and wow it’s so much better. 

Bears r fuk
Yeah the IV is insane. Selling CC’s on those rallies has been the easy vega plays Ive ever done.
Bro, you don’t need to spam this on every thread it’s ok to be excited.
Look what the Melvin paid troll just put out:

Good PR
BB 12c 01/29? Good idea, bad idea?
How old?
Same
was gonna say lmao, i was thinking of doing a month long short on it with a strike price of 35, it's too high for a dying company in debt closing locations left and right
I almost want to make fun of you because it is typical of basically every 401k plan on earth, it is usually just a button on your 401k providers website like Fidelity and it is almost always 50% of your vested balance ie you can't borrow 100% against your 401k balance they will give you half as a secured loan and let you pick most of the re-payment terms, often you can just have payroll deducted as well and that is it.
What would the math on that be? Any idea what they need to cover their shorts? How many shares? Cause lets say they bought at both 55 and 40. And for example, by them accelerating the squeeze or then I guess them exercising it themselves lol, the PT end of day is $60. Lets say all 40k at 55 are theirs and say another 40k at 40 (for example but prob much less), they would make around 30M each for 60M total. But will have added $20 per share they have to cover? The question is how many shares did they borrow, is it in any of the DDs.
this is the way
450,000-500,000, exactly what I thought you said.
Attendance for retards who bought $BB. We are waiting for FB settlement tomorrow 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀
BUY GME CALLS AND SHARES
what do you think it will open at tomorrow. I bought some after hours
Surprised this isn't the highest upvoted comment. Probably the best very recent example of extreme irrational exuberance. Took almost 3 years for this bubble to pop, and valuations are still pretty high. 

Similarly to Tesla, no matter how you did the math, even when accounting for 100% market dominance, the valuations didn't make sense.
That's it. Do you want in? Cuz I will actually do this
Yes
Just drove past a middle aged man in a leather jacket holding a picket sign saying everything in gamestop is 70% including fixtures

I'm buying puts tomorrow.
they just posted that 2 hours ago!!!
So it's a win then.

Nice.
Joe, please say the following:

1.) 1.5tn Stimulus

2.) 2.4tn Infrastructure bill focusing on clean energy 

3.) telehealth was a massive success during Covid, pumping money into increasing telehealth adoption. TDOC awarded $200bn dollar contract and named company of the century. Stock price legally mandated to rise 69%. 

4.) “Tesla to Mars.”

5.) “God Bless America”
Y
good luck.
At this rate, we need Buyden to name drop individual company tickers to save our calls.
No idea, I bought it so *checks notes* it should be down.
Ban him from this sub, or Zacks. The more notoriety, the more fake posts and fake dd spam. Does he define FD’s in the article?

-2. I will be born 2 years from now
Crazy to think that it’s only the beginning, I appreciate your informative reply, good luck to you and may GME take us to the promise land
The reason I'm asking is because soma guy on a website that shall not be named (lookingBeta) spent his whole day writing an article with all kinds of technical analysis, trying to prove that GME was a shit company that was going to fail, and all of us here on wsb would look like idiots. I was thinking to myself 'Hell, I'll go balls deep in $KKK or $NAZI if it would make me a profit, I DGAF about whether or not the company lives/thrives'. I just was curious if it was just me or not. Looks like that question has been answered. Glad I'm not the only one that thinks the author completely missed the mark.
of course he is going to pump clean energy, but on the clean energy companies that gave him money.  Quid pro Joe is back in the game...  The question is, what clean energy companies paid him?
By next morning at this rate...
Biden sending out $1400...not bad homie not bad
It's been 17 months since he posted his first Jan 15 2021 call, this position has a gestation period close to an Indian Elephant
The squeeze has not squoze
52 week high hit on BB? Idgaf I’m buying FDs at open bitch. ALL IN.
It’s gonna keep going.  Their ad revenue is fucked...on top of everything else.
Lolol
Is there a link to his channel? I can’t seem to find it
Damn nice! Is your main account bigger than half a milli? Idk how some of you guys are bringing in these stellar numbers.
Biden 1.9 trillion “first stage” plan
I have been on this sub for 3 years and i somehow keep missing out on the fucking meme stocks....
1/15 $39 and 1/22 $40 calls
Yeah, a true revival of the pokemon franchise would be huge for Nintendo and GameStop.
Should I still buy GME now even if I can only afford 10?
What kind of encouragement should we throw? "Hey man, don't give up, keep underperforming the market"?

OP clearly needs some guidance, because whatever he's doing is obviously wrong.
Sounds like you’re way too overqualified for this shithole. It’s basically the dirty couch lol
Wth?? Why? Though green announcement was supposed to help?
lol GME gonna still go up in the coming weeks
Every one grilling this person but no offense if I had kids living with me till almost 40 they would ruin my FIRE plans... staring 15 years ago.
What happened in November to make this crash so hard
Fish jerky is fine
We literally controle the market is'nt There law that prevent people from doing that

Would it be q bad idea to buy gme now? I doubted it when it first started and now I regret my decision
I've given up in the short term already barring any new partnerships or big news.  I think this will be a great med-long term play though so I'm just gonna keep holding my shares
Trying to debate buying another 100 shares tonight or in the morning. I think tonight
https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/solar-inverter/tesla-solar-inverter
Try MT :))

The real question is if this experience and profit makes him more or less likely to do something similar in the future
I'd say it's relative because you'll need to sell in the next three weeks.
I don’t think pdt shouldn’t be a thing but I think the 25k req is way too high
Dump it into GME
Stfu the whole point is to make money with risky trades not only sticking to bullish plays.watch the market shift in a year and retards like you are gonna get ass fucked on every play.  
Be Autists
Not Retards
Me with tesla today
He is an instrument of the opposition, Melvins “Uncle Tom”...
GME “the last dance”
https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/solar-inverter/tesla-solar-inverter
Yea I debated up until 357
Yo I never got that $600....anyone else still waiting on that?
I'll be making $15/H at wendy's after this stimmy 😏
Plus he knows we would repay the favor by buying loads of Tesla shares and calls and diamond handing the shit out of them, win win for everybody
Bonk
It was a March expiry too lol. I belong here
Like a true retard, I bought 20 $12 3/19c early December because I saw BB meme with rocket ship emojis on it. They were like .08 at one point and I forgot about them until today 🤑
I just googled Rod Alzmann twitter, I don’t have an actual Twitter account
When Walrus speaks.. you listen.
Gonna open $43-45 from the margins calls. Then the gamma squeeze kicks in with all the new call options vaulting us to ~$47. At this point we break free from algorithms ability to control things as all technical analysis fails in the extreme tail of projections with high volatility. I have no clue where we go from there. $55 seems a conservative estimate. Infinity squeeze could happen but it’s a slim chance
Nice additional dd. Watch out on the 0dte can get liquidated into an incredible close. That’s why I’m using next week, my account doesn’t have a lot of margin flex at the moment.
Best Buy
Yeah true that’s a good amount of money I was up to 30k but yeah some bad trades. But just put all that shit in dividends and growth and you might not ever have to work again!!
Thank u bb
Loan me 20k

please do. I need PLTR to go up. :)
Icln on moon watch... but I am prepared to be disappointed.
I don’t get why everyone thinks Biden is going to discuss clean energy plans when the schedule clearly says this speech is about controlling the pandemic 🤷‍♂️
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀
I think at some point maybe if we got to the point where we are at “coast fire” or something it would be nice to quit my job and go work at a coffee shop or local place where I don’t have many responsibilities
Imagine buying a micro stock at .020 for 10,000,000,000. And then the stock reaches $1.
I basically deployed all my money into AMZN 1/22 $3055/3050 put credit spreads yesterday. Gonna need them to yee haw into earnings week.
Not really tbh. This was in waits to pop if youve followed the stock for awhile, and followed its news and numbers etc.
URG COME BACK bb
Im guessing you guys haven't heard of stablecoins that yield 8-10%
everyone says thats a bad mindset, i know how you feel tho lol
Got VALE calls out to June. Super bullish, only thing I worry about is it looks like Biden might be pushing off unveiling his infastructure plan.
Did they just slap ya again
It has the best margins out of FAANG and the third largest cash reserve. This is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market
Right? Making money with weed and clean energy just feels so #wholesome. Rather than giving money to fucking Bezos or Zuckerberg
In @ 1.18! One of the most promising COVID-19 plays IMO. 🚀🚀🚀

Yup

I got more shares. it is what it is. not selling till i see space.
Short squeeze just like GME
It doesn't post the numbers like the others but is steady and has taken the rug pulls much better.

With BABA coming out of purgatory, it might have a good run.
Holding 540 shares, NNDM is game changing tech. Nice gains.

Hey, if it does, I will be absolutely delighted!
I’m telling.
you talkin about a girl I know
I’m in on SRPT cause of Cathi too
Thank you so much. So as long as I buy the option and then sell it on the market I can make my tendies and no longer have to worry about that contract again.
Also risk it falling down again haha. But you’re right. It feels very wrong to exercise before expiration.
Stop being poor then, it’s that easy lol
On BP's share buyback program expected to start Q3-Q4

>Our buyback scenario analysis results show that under our current macro Commodities team's oil price deck, BP can potentially buy back US$1.2bn in 2021 and US$4.1bn in 2022, resulting in an annual yield of c.1.5% and 5.0% respectively. We note that despite the dividend cut the company announced in 2020, BP currently offers a 5.1% dividend yield (2021E), which, with the addition of the buyback programme as outlined above, could result in total cash returns to shareholders of 6.6%/10.1% in 2021/22 respectively.
INTC and TSM up good....yet AMD and NVDA killed. Su Bae, pleas fly again.

Its not a pump n dump. WSB is the market now. We want it to go up, it goes up. So its just a pump since stocks only go up
Each contract is 100 shares, but it’s value depends on moneyness, which affects the deltas if your option

Some of you guys need to realize when it’s time to stop with a stock and move on with your earnings. This is how you lose money. From personal experience. See you guys tomorrow when we upgrade our earnings from GME TO BB. Tendies 🚀
you're braindead. GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀 tm easily
I can’t pay in cash they only let me pay on the Apple website
Yeah, somewhere on their website they talk about how they can offer such low spreads for currencies. I wish metals and crypto had low spreads but I guess they're not there yet. Currency wise, it's a scalper's dream with such low spreads.
Is it news or just on the website?
I had a nightmare that the SEC shut WSB down because our army got to strong. I don’t respect the SEC and you shouldn’t either
Checking in checking in. There’s absolutely no fucking way BB can go tits up. We’ve just reached the stratosphere. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
There's no substance to the rumor though is there?
That hit a little too close to home 🤣

I was thinking a hedge as well, but reading about GME on wsb over the past few months you just never know. I have seen crazier YOLO's here.

Yes, but if earnings it good, it’ll print hard!

1400$ stimmy incoming. Bears r fuk big time
RIOT this year
How retarded would 1/22 19c be?
When did you buy? 
  
Hold at least until Monday
Yeah same with me..I found that Merrill has quit a few restrictions on what you can buy so I opened up a second account at Fidelity and works great between the two accounts. Bought ARKF at Fidelity no problem 👍🏼
BUY signal if I've ever seen one. Got 100 shares AH at 9.64 bc why not
Yessss I’m in it! We will moon if he pumps up the green deal
Glory to you my lord!
Bags of BlackBerry.
BB gonna break $10 AH
There’s a lot of uncertainty. The question is, is it all priced in? We’ll see tomorrow
2nd users actually a very big market for industrial and commercial parts. Plus their refurbishment areas are now certified. 

Shoes finatics are a MAJOR purchaser. In fact collectible shoe sales increased hugely in the paSt year. In a time of pinching pennies where you go christmas shopping the discount store... ding and ding. This is going to 60. Possibly beyond. The PE ratio is 7... thats crazy. After earnings it might be like 4.
Didn’t get any last year either
added 1725 shares today
Last week on the 7th, big dip on earnings. I’m up over 600% on BBBY calls if you peep my profile
Get back on the horse next week! And get some some of that sweet 20% GME margin tomorrow to tide you over.
they just posted it on the website.. no news yet
Still stand by what I said. Maybe it’s a great meme stock to do some calls for a few months. Terrible 401K dump.
Weeklies during earnings is almost always a surefire bet
yes. Once exercised. But they won't be exercised so long as they retain extrinsic value. Example: Stock worth 45, call at 44. Exercise for 1$ value or sell for 3$ price? Until the call no longer has that 2$ of value granted to it by time, there's no incentive to exercise. However, there IS an incentive for the person who sold the call to COVER by buying the stock directly.
I remember reading some guys DD here in December on BB and thinking it was stupid. Now look at me 🤡
holy hell they’re desperate, and they’re shilling five below instead?? nah mate
Where is your loyalty!?
He made that bet against a hedge fund that took 2% fees and 20% of profit, as a direct bet against the two-and-twenty fee structure.  The owner of the hedge fund even said his own funds weren't even designed to beat the market and that the bet was worth it just to have direct access to Buffet.  His basket also did exceedingly poor over the time span

He doesn't even look like a boomer himself, so he should geed it.

I got paper hands for a minute and sold only to buy back in at $39 like a complete fucking retard
Wow. This isnt autism, this is something else.
Go to babypips and learn about risk management. Also, take it easy with the pushups if you haven't done them in a long time because you could rip a muscle or develop tendonitis. Maybeix up the exercises and decreasebthe number or reps?
there are also razor thin margins in the business and customers prefer the black market stuff anyway, because it's not stale and old like OTC stuff.
r u srs? It offered to me after my first option.
Nah, boomer would be still clinging to the "BuT No OnE CaN BeAt ThE MaRkEt" nonsense and staying in index funds or dividend shit during the biggest bull run of the century over the next ten years.

Gen X here, I mostly buy shares too. Options are fun but I need to get back to having a life and not checking things 24/7
Just trying to let people know not to panic if it does dip, I think after the two massive run ups we've had, a bit of a correction is not impossible. But I'm happy to be proven wrong!
Yup - that's what I meant about taking the quote out of context.
How many millions is Melvin the cuck short GME?
You forgot « Hold your GME shares bitches »
I have precisely zero idea other than luck. I use TDAmeritrade. I began in March of 2020. Initially put $200 in and added another $100 two weeks later. Since I've just been buying and selling essentially whenever I feel like it (while avoiding pattern day trading rule). General practice I've followed is sell after any one particular stock hits a 10% gain but it's not a steadfast rule. I avoid the hyper popular things like tesla and plantatir(sp). I have only taken one or two losses over the course of this. My buying habits are based my own intuition or using some of TD's built in screeners. This has been solely a fun little experiment for me and is by no means related to any actual financial plan. My retirement planning and investments are completely separate.  Essentially I couldn't go play Blackjack because of COVID so the stock market became the spot for a little bit of "fun" money to be spent (and then I started playing on "house" money, so I never added any more).
so the pussies at melvin have to close their positions tomorrow before market close, if not that shit is gonna expire, so the GME peak has to come before close right?
They're trying so hard to keep it down it's honestly pathetic LMAO GME TO THA MOON BITCHES 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Once ARKX hits the market I’m blindly commuting to it no matter what
I guess it depends on how much wiggle room you have in your monthly budget or how much you keep in cash if you want to have that flexibility for one-time large expenses.  We have enough of a buffer not to have to dip into our taxable.

6.) Cramer is head of $$ now.
SCR (theScore) is essentially a Canadian sports media company. That's not interesting. What \*is\* interesting though, is their growth in sports betting and that they're well positioned and fully prepared for upcoming that upcoming legislation that will legalize single-event sports betting in Canada.

Why is it going to the moon?

1) Well positioned to capitalize on legalization of single-event sports betting in Canada. They can leverage their brand, large userbase, and existing betting system (in some US states) to own a big share of the sports gambling market.

2) As a smaller Canadian company, it's overlooked in general. Canadian stocks don't get anywhere near the coverage of US stocks. This means you can get in when undervalued, though it's a weight on the stock until it has a higher market cap.

3) Prime candidate for buyout post-legalization by a larger, likely US company.

4) They're planning to list on a US stock exchange as well, leading to an influx of new investors.

The stock is already up huge, but will go higher. So strap in autistonauts, SCR will  **🚀🚀🚀**  to the moon!

I've concluded getting more money is better than getting less money in smaller payments. I've also concluded I can't invest it all in risky growth companies so my largest positions Apple, JP Morgan, Facebook, Microsoft, Disney and Abbvie I'll be keeping. All those which is 51% of my portfolio. Also debating on keeping Raytheon which is 5%. Probably letting go Store Capital. The rest of my holdings are growth plays.
well enjoy the interest on the loan. And pending where you live expect to lose 40% of that gain....so calculate that in before you stick the money back in the 401k before it defaults and you get a 10% penalty + taxes.

>I might be stupid but i see no money flowing to AMD investors while the shares get diluted by new shares sold by management

This is as dumb as saying:

>I might be stupid but i see no money flowing to AMD investors while the company pays its employees

They're diluting their company through 2 things: one of them is employee compensation, and it's standard for basically all public companies. Those insider trades you linked to are related to employee compensation. The other dilutive event is AMD selling stock to raise capital to invest in projects. It dilutes shareholders while not changing the overall value of an investors holdings, because for every dollar of dilution, the balance sheet of the company improves by a dollar. 

Another example: Let's say there's a company that is literally $10, and it has 10 shares, of which you own 1. I sell an additional share of stock for $1. Oh no! Now you don't have 10% of the company anymore! You only have 9%! You've been diluted! Your new percentage of the company is worth.... $1! A loss of $0.00! Incredible! Math!

>Intel pays dividends and the shares are not constantly getting diluted so i like Intel better.

It's fine to like Intel more than AMD. It's fine to like a stable dividend company instead of a growth company. But your arguments for why you like it literally make no sense. "I like the sky because it's brown!" Well, it's fine to like the sky, but that doesn't make your qualifier true. Same concept here: you may like Intel more than AMD, but your reasoning is predicated on a misunderstanding of dilutive events and the financial ramifications of them.

NFLX has to keep adding new subscribers or raise rates to make money and to keep up with the operating cost.

All other streams are catching up
Good call on LAM though, I was just looking into them and they do seem pretty awesome. I'm not sure if you saw this but it seems like the US wants to start keeping silicon development and manufacturing within borders to limit the possibility of something like the solar winds hack happening again.

Well Jerome Powell’s response was that they were not going to change rates for a while, if not years, until the economy recovered. So after that I’m not worried about a crash
Nothing is exciting until it's going up 20% everyday. But then, it's too late to get it for max gains. GME was the same when it was dumping from 20 to 15$

So what’s your strategy then? Stop-Order to save gains?
I mean I agree with your sentiment but I don’t feel as though that would be the difference maker in market movement I think since it’s a temporary gig and not an actual business improvement it won’t amount to much. I’m wrong all the time though 🤷🏽‍♂️

Not entirely sure but hopefully it bounces back after Biden’s speech. I kinda wish I sold this morning but I thought it would keep going up in anticipation for his speech. Even if it doesn’t bounce back, I think I’ll hold the shares for a bit since it seems like a profitable company (to me at least. I’m still very new to investing).

Everyone is so bullish on commodities and bearish on the dollar , no way this works out the way everyone thinks it will
It would definitely move a penny depending on the stock. If the average sub on here has just $1000, we are talking nearly $2 billion all getting dumped into a company. That would be a large increase in a lot of company’s mkt cap for one day.
So google is paying 7.35 per share. Your calls will be sold or expired worthless if it didn’t meet that breakeven price. Basically once a stock is sold out, it disappears from the stock market and you can’t trade it anymore

Hey lemme know if I'm being retarded, in a bad way, but how big is their short position.  Cause lets say they bought at both the way OOTMS at dirt cheap and the IV crushed OTMs (55C and 40C). And for example, by them accelerating the squeeze or then I guess them exercising it themselves lol, the PT end of day is $60. Lets say all 40k at 55 are theirs and say another 40k at 40 (for example but prob much less), they would make around 30M each for 60M total. I'm getting these numbers from this [DD](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxdn4u/gme_very_likely_to_go_to_47_or_more_tomorrow_480/) of the option volumes. But will have added $20 per share they have to cover? The question is how many shares did they borrow, is it in any of the DDs?

I just started reading a month ago. I just made 1000% off a $75 GameStop option. $30 1/15... you all know where I learned this power.

This is awesome. Thanks for taking the time to educate us a bit note.
Ah yes. Would've probably lost all my money by now if it did
Shitron trashing lemonade. Can we summon all autists to load up and prove him wrong, once again?
GME flat AH. Was jumping 10-20% AH yesterday. Ride over?
old news
Thanks, dude. Your brain has more wrinkles than me
All those over 40s unite!
Yep waiting for that too with 1/29 140c I bought 3 days ago lol. Love tsm
Likely a heavy bull run, but it is causing the interest rates on short positions to skyrocket, making holding them much more uncomfortable on top of the massive value loss to their positions since the stock has soared over 100% this week alone. This could be viewed as maybe a pre-squeeze, shaking out maybe some of the smaller shorts, but the big ones are still there and they took out even more short positions today. It could initiate a full squeeze, though, very soon. Given the outstanding short interest, it could be epic.
Which just leads to the creation of a new sub - WallStreetWagers
Yes exactly this. It's why I'm trying to catch as many sunsets as I can this winter. It is half an hour where my only job is to enjoy the scenery and eat a snack before packing up and biking home
Just got pinged on BB messenger. Collect call from the moon
bet, its 2000% interest though and you have to pay it back within a week
Isn't the market closed monday for MLK day
Never happened to me in over 100 trades made, 90 of those Ive lost
Depends on what price you got it for...
It's different when you make a lot of fucking money at once.

Apparently so, too many factors, weak hands...idiots buying shares on margin accounts etc.

All good, in this mission we all in the same gang
Good job! Keep pushing!
My guess is that it is a robotic/drone/data-based farming thing. I couple of other recent ARK buys (RAVN, TRMB) are pretty pure plays in that area. Either that or people are just coming to realize that nothing runs like a Deere.
Just broke $10!
Holy crap I forgot DeepFuckingValue has 10,000 calls at $8. This guy is gonna  create a shit storm. All hail DeepFuckingValue 📈🚀

Sold GME yesterday at peak and then went into BB today in the morning and essentially doubled my GME gains. Of course I also put back all the money in 55c

Strap up and strap-on boys, EVERYTHING is gapping up tonight!!!
how is it going to squeeze if they themselves aren't buying the shares. We're talking about two different type of squeezes, a short squeeze caused by people HAVING to buy back no matter what at any price and a gamma squeeze which is caused by options.

Without the buying pressure of the short squeeze the gamma squeeze is unlikely. Elsewise, you would just permanently see every stock squeeze due to options. If they start buying options, the odds are that those options will end up expiring worthless.
Too late to get on this train?!!  Just grabbed 100 shares in the afters. Should I also grab some OTM leaps at open tomorrow?

PDT is based on opening transactions. If you buy the same security three times and then sell it all at once, that would be three day trades.

What broker do you use to sell puts? 

Reason I'm asking, I'm currently trading with a margin account on IBKR but keeps indicating 'Not enough funds'. I thought selling puts gives you a credit initially, so wouldn't there not need to be any balance?

A) Get a margin account and start trading options ASAP.  
B) You CAN buy calls and puts, and even sell covered calls in your TFSA.   
Buy LEAPS, buy FDs, farm theta, whatever you want. There are "options" to what you can do with your TFSA, and I don't think CRA or whoever will come knocking.

Actually I’m more pissed than excited (btw I’m not hashing back, just explaining). I made a post about this (got taken down because I forgot positions) and then I updated it and that also got taken down. Basically the post was how I got massacred by PRPL last year and since then I’ve had trust issues with anything on here. Thing is every bullish OP for a stock pick is convinced theirs is the next flight to the moon. After seeing everything with GME, I feel like I was sucked back in but not with something that already lifted off, I want a train that just started to go CHOO CHOO, and that for me is BB. I FOMOed in and now I hope you retards are right but I feel like it’s my first time out the gulag, not trying to go back in because of paper hands

Bought shares early but now I wished I finished reading how option trading worked a few hours earlier.
When do the shorts get margin called?

That has nothing to do with market cap and PE dumbass
So here’s the thing guys just don’t buy puts
for options yes, shares buy now!
You may find (I did) that work is providing a lot of structure and schedule in your life that you weren't aware of.  You get up every day, shower, dress, eat, etc, on schedules that are designed to meet work requirements.  When work stops, you may lose that structure and need to replace it with something of your own.  It may help having a second person in your household to maintain patterns.

Retiring from work is satisfying, but retiring TO something is even better.  Do you have any other ideas how you might like to spend all that time that used to go to work, besides your travel plans, or maybe that's enough to focus on to start?

This week is the most autistic the market has been for us.

I think it’s always good to mentally prepare for a dip when you’re diamond handing a moon shot. But given the current momentum, I strongly doubt any massive dip tomorrow especially with so many worthless puts expiring.
LMND bulls are retarded so no
Ooof this one gotta hurt
look into TNXP and IBIO they are about to fly 

if you want to make a quick buck invest in BIOL and OPGN
For sure, I didn’t take that risk sounds like you didn’t either. Seems like a win win, OP has a shit load of money and you’re happy you didn’t take that same risk
Yeah but the timing of him getting GME to bounce over 100% in the final week is what people are getting at. Most would have sold after the first bounce.
STIMMYS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
Just got off a call from my boy H.Biden and he tells me that the big guy loves him some underaged girls, Viagra, naps in the basement, and investing 10% of the stimulus into some stonk called GME. Use this information as you wish

I actually love theta plays because I don't need to think about an exit strategy and less FOMO also
I don't know about options... boomer
Needing a bit of a think tank. Does anyone have any recommendations about what all to look for when researching companies?

I'm pretty new to the investing world. I have put in about $1400 in stocks and about $1100 in crypto. However, last year I was given 18 shares of TGT.  It's done quite well, almost doubling since I got it, and I want to think that there's more room for growth. However, I'm also not sure that I want to risk a big downturn with how much it's grown in a year. I'm starting to think about pulling it out and putting it into an ETF but I can't decide. I know timing the market is a fools errand but I want to ride the wave for as long as I can.
Is it too late to get some calls? I was about to pull the trigger on 1 contract 12.5c 1/22
Same here, such a long stretch but after that’s it’s pretty nice.

Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour
Extending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of September

The merger gives 0.83 TLRY shares for each APHA share. APHA is currently trading below that ratio so if you buy APHA and the merger goes through you would hold more TLRY at the end.
Lol omg this is so retarded. 

BB, BBBY, GME

My childhood trauma is finally paying off!
Load up on clean energy stuff.  Either tons of money continues to be poured into it over the next 20+ years or climate change devastates the globe and stocks are screwed anyways.  Picking the right companies may prove challenging though, so do a LOT of research and keep up with it or just stick to ETFs

Is it better to buy Options on BB THERE LIKE $300 one year out or just a much of shares?

No, it's cheap, can still get a share for less than a large Wendy's Baconator meal
Which is why ain't. :)
I just bought 10 shares at like 9.80. It’s over 10 already
if BB dips at open i think imma buy some shares
Ask your grandkids.
Not as bad as r/dividends or r/investing
Both and CLF
In 1k shares at $9. Let’s go guys
Yep
So essentially they’d either spend $960 for 100 shares of a stock at $9.60 OR they spend $954 for 100 shares at $9 right?

The latter being the obvious choice because they not only pay less but they’re getting the stock at a discount. 

Am I understanding right?

Some people spend every waking moment on trade ideation and tool development, and others don't. It's entirely a function of your own time management and headspace allocation.

If you're planning your trades around catalysts, it's possible to do your research overnight, trade from your phone, and exit positions aggressively once catalysts pass -- whether or not you made money.

The problem is that you need to get the information into your brain somehow, and for me that means a comfortable dedicated space, external monitors, and constant attention to the news.

If you can see your catalysts coming from a mile away, then you can plan your research to not interfere with your readings. There's a different kind of focus for legal reading than for trading research -- for me at least. I try to be active and sensitive when trading, but dispassionate and trancelike when reading anything legal or technical.

It's hard for me to think about anything unrelated to the markets when I'm running risk, so in your position I'd probably take one-day positions around catalysts so that I can stay risk-off most of the time.
I'm gonna Guess Joe's $15/hr minimum wage doesn't make it.  Don't think he could even get all the democrats on board with that one.

Thanks for explaining. I'm pretty new to this. So I'm torn between expecting a run-up tomorrow morning or if it just goes sideways for a while as the shorters are maybe expecting de-hedhing in the afternoon and wait till then with covering their positions, so no strong price increases?

If there should be a bullish morning though, would it be good to try to close long positions at that peak before the de-hedhing starts increasing in the afternoon driving price back down? 

I want to make clear I don't expect advice of any kind, but I appreciate comments on these ideas very much as additional input for my decision!
\^this, we should still see a gap up or 2 @ least before this even sees a cooling down.
Lmao I thought it was SESN which I have a position in, huge catalyst potentially coming up on this one too. Anyone who makes typos should be safe 👏

I would have liked it long term if not for those bagholders out there and the sentiment.

Have made money off it twice since but took too long each time and not enough.

Because covered calls are free money for bulls if you bet correctly, despite being bearish. The market is not binary bear or bull bets.

It's easy to overlook because everyone here is into derivatives until the IV gets too high (i.e., GME), but if you hold allotments of 100 shares and don't sell OTM calls against them, I don't know why you'd have an options account in the first place. You're leaving money on the table. Reducing cost basis 101.

We in trouble now boys.  My GF now has a RH account and $1k in GME.  She's over in her office laughing at all your dumb memes
Shares are fine, you just have to sell when the price is up. Dude bought calls, which are basically bets that the stock will have risen to a certain price by a certain date. This allows you to buy a stock for a cheaper price than the current value, if you so choose, by offering a small "down payment". But it's optional to buy it, hence a call being an "option". He bought a 10 call for March, meaning if the stock rises to $10 in March, he's made money by "reserving" it at the current price. But he only loses a little bit if it goes down and he chooses not to buy it, instead of losing the actual value lost (like when you buy a share and it goes down).
Logical. If you do the TA, it creates an injection directly into the economy via the gaming community. :)
Inverse wsb.
You know it's reached peak WSB when you don't even have to list the ticker and EVERYONE knows who you mean.
r/bonfire does. crackle crackle.

Oh shit. Nevermind. Do NOT tell your family. You don't want to cause the demise off this entire sub.

Pro tip: telling your family you made money means the stock is guaranteed to plummit the next week.

Agreed.  I'm a lot of things, but "social" is not one of them.
Thank you, it is insane! I'm trying to follow what exactly is going on with the call (how it works) and what the cost basis is in it.

Balloons are much more steerable then people realize.  Wind often goes different directions at different heights.  You can use that to help move where you want to be.  Believe it or not there are even competitions for this where you fly the balloon to specific spots and try to be the most accurate.
It always get graduated like over 5 years.

They'll allow the states to have say in it.
The other options and strike prices would get you ITM a lot easier, why risk a $4c?
Sheesh my taxes aren’t looking good right now, very bad. Unintentionally got awash sale, anyway to get out of it

440 shares @14.something
and yeah i was looking at dividends, 10k in both mcdonalds and coke seem to be good but also ive heard MP is great too. I wanna try and balance my portfolio between ETFS dividends and growth stocks. Im think 30/30/40 would be a safe balance
What did you buy in at?
I have a reasonable amount too believe in the company. It will go a long way.

We are not done yet GME go🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I thought volatility was a terrible measure of risk, at least according to Buffett-sama
Stop spamming this.
Today I lost enough money to buy a McChicken sandwich with a medium soda
One more question. If I place a trade after hours at 5:01p, as a market order, does my trade get executed in order or receipt? Ie after anyone trading before 5:01p but before anyone trading after.
😲

That alone would send wmt down 10 percent.
BB mooned and up 10% after hours
Chasing is when you buy into something that is already running hard and liable to peak. This usually means you end up buying at the top price and are left ‘holding bags’ because the price crashes and doesn’t recover for a long time. 

It’s also known as purchase by FOMO (fear of missing out). 

Instead of chase you should *dig* a position in a spot liable to run in the future. Then wait for it to take off and sell. 

You find out which ones are going to run by doing DD (due diligence aka reading a lot of shit).
EVERYONE JUMP ON
Guys are happy making 0.0001% gains while risking a butt load. I want moon gains and risk everything and then some
Or shirts that say "I spent millions of dollars on GME puts and all I got was this stupid t-shirt"
BB!?!
Use your Greeks
Bought 4 $9 1/29, all I see is 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
nope, just that massive sell order keeping it flat. blessed be thy hands, deep be thy fuckin value.
Would you consider a 9% jump in a single day massive? Do NOT compare it to the ridiculous moves that GME has done lol.
God's gonna call you for stock advice tomorrow
adult dependents are in for a check under that biden proposal. let's fucking go baby, all in on BB
It’s over $10 now. Calls about to print tomorrow
There is also the extremely conspicuous sales pitch pressure selling language. "Last chance guys", "Everybody else is getting in", "Think about how you'll feel if you miss out". Get fucked my man. 

Even the "disclaimer" at the end is actually meant to reassure you. Hey, this guy has $50k to piss away on penny stocks, he must know what's up/have faith in TANH. This is real basic shit, please do not fall for it.
Remind me! 2 weeks
Hey, gainz is gainz
Same...
Being able to make art without the need for clients for the rest of my life would be a complete dream. I would probably work longer hours than I currently do.
6, 12 and 24 months out
Bought 1,000 shares. Let's do this 🚀🚀
The first most shorted stock was Tesla wasn’t it? WallStreetBets kicks ass. Fuck MM’s and Institutional investing. Our collective Autism and the wife’s boyfriends allowance is all we need!! 🚀🚀🚀
The argument for across the board min wage is dumb af, should be tacked to cost of living
amzn already has a $15 min wage.
Their growth is almost as good as their turkey chili
Take a look a the top 20 of the SP500. How many of these are energy companies?  I rest my case.  The Tesla insurance business is bigger than you realize and they will disrupt the auto nsurance business, which is also a massive industry.
The “large deposit” explanation letter I’m going to have to write for my mortgage application should be interesting for them to read.

“I YOLO’d $10k into OTM GameStop calls because these retards on Reddit told me it was a sure thing, something about a short squeeze. I was balls deep in them for two months, until Ryan Cohen took over one week it mooned to fucking Neptune.”
CANNABIS!!! Tilray (TLRY) about to short squeeze!!!!!
Why?
I looks at my GME calls I sold yesterday. 😭😭😭
everyone else’ buying power will be reduced, unless he plans on increasing wages accordingly. Then you’re looking at inflation.

Old dude will forget what he said before he takes office.
I got in this morning.  Now it’s up 12%.
Tesla needs to make hydroponics and solar that targets weed growing.
Hell yes. Some blessed strange made me buy a call yesterday. It's up 140% today.  I'm riding this 🚀

3/19 10c @$.68

🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀
2020 taxes?
I was looking for bottomed out offering plays on FinViz and it popped up. Did some quick research and I liked the financials and chart.
correct. you can generally expect contracts to sell for the difference between the strike price and the share price + a slight discount.
I agree with you there. I've mostly been very confident throughout my career, but not always. There were a couple low points where my confidence was shot, and that's when I was in those dead-end jobs with lousy management or leadership.
I was promised a biden pump. Why am i redder than close?!?
Could someone that has BB 9.5C for 1/15 tell me what they're worth right now cus I sold mine right before market close today
inb4 someone says Chegg, theres no way gov is funding a cheating platform
It'll likely be a five year phase in starting 2022. They'll have time to adapt. If they can't, fuck 'em. I like my stuff to print as much as the next dude, but businesses should pay a living wage
I sold a BB call up 500% today and am still regretting not holding it
Keep fuelling up the rocketship, we can let them join when we circle the moon at $20 in a month.
Biden pumping BB in his presser tonight??

Limit sell at 650!
Was locked in my own bathroom for about 10min  because I forgot how to open it, kids dont do drugs it’ll catch up once you’re older.
BNGO hit my stop loss yesterday. All i feel is pain.
It’s all going to GME
Yeah I bought 2 $8c 2/12 yesterday for almost no money. Wish I went all in lol
The yield on an investment is the amount of cash flow it pays, period. If you have a thousand dollars in an asset that pays 3%, that’s $30 cash flow annually. Well what if you paid $500 for that asset originally, what’s your cash flow?.....Still $30. Your cost doesn’t change the cash flow from the asset. People try to delude themselves into thinking their yield is somehow higher? The cash flow remains the same. Now in this example the asset appreciated, so you have a capital gain on paper, still doesn’t change your cash flow.
Weeks? More like months. Homies out here thinking we just randomly picked it up.
A lot of BB talk I’m scared for my GME 0.0
I bought at $1 yesterday, it's gone up high and then down bit I don't mind cos I believe in the company and the renewables era is just starting so it will climb, biggest thing I've learnt recently at great expense is don't buy on a high unless you think it's still climbing I normally wait an hour after open. And secondly don't pull out for atleast 3 weeks or unless it's loosing rediculous! Otherwise you may as well be in the casino 😀
Nahhh it's all about NEE gang
YESSIR
This kid gonna go places.
Sitting on a conservative growth (40/60?) fund is less bad than sitting on cash, but the same logic applies. If you are comfortable with more risk in general, it's better to do it sooner rather than later.
Lol why’d you buy calls you might as well have bought shares at that price

Thanks to the dude who mentioned BB last week.
I loaded up on 3c 1/20/2023 shortly before close and now I’m just dreading not being able to spend that money as I ride BB to $20 for the next year
If this is in the green, can you sell your congrats at any point?
Only here to pnd anybody else?
2021 just keeps getting weirder and weirder. first its the insurrection on the capital, now we're filling our portfolio's with gme and bb. wtf

I'm from Canada. I know it's anecdotal, but all my friends and I from university buy weed at legal weed stores. Finding and waiting for a dealer is a hassle, and the weed bought at legal stores is always perfectly dried and cured, and has consistent quality. Plus prices have come down like crazy. 

Come to think of it, I actually don't know anyone personally that still buys weed off the streets....
Anyone holding BB calls?  Looking to open a leap position but IV looks pretty high right now.
Oh shit. BRB.
So weird u listed CMG there

B f’ing B!!!
Tempered expectations always better than having some GME fantasy shut down brutally.

That being said, I'm basically same position as you, 1.1k shares @16.40 so even if we dip briefly it won't make much of a difference. Dips will be bought.
is it expected to continue tomorrow?
Thank you lord and saviour sir Walrus ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Let’s be real this drawdown didn’t work out too well.
So? Whats your issue with people finally getting a raise in wages its literally been multiple decades of stagnant wages and record spending on buybacks and military budgets. Let everyone make some money instead of the few
you sure that's him?!!! how do you know?!
BB!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍
i have a 40 and a 43 im ready
ACTIVE DUTY GAMERS TO THE MOON
The short position is 77 million shares as of yesterday. They haven't started covering yet.
I’m away from this for a fucking hour and come back and there’s cum all over BB, I cannot keep up
Don't count your ~~chickens~~ fat stimmy before ~~they hatch~~ it's in your bank account.
Or shirts that say "I spent millions of dollars on GME puts and all I got was this stupid t-shirt"
$600 + $1400 = $2000. There, solved it for ya.
I'm downvoting for him putting that amount of money on a high IV underlying without even double checking via Google which strike to long and which to short.

Learning is cool though.
what calls are you leaning towards for each one?
**Things that will print tomorrow:**

 * TSLA ☑

 * AAPL ☑

 * AMZN ☑

 * MSFT ☑

 * GME ✅
What’s your max gain?
Our heavenly Pumper

JPow be thy name

And lead us not into destitution

But deliver us fat stacks

Amen
lol @ the TSLA safety report suddenly getting way worse this year. hope that doesn't fuck my calls tho
Been holding $10 1/15 calls since December 1st. Almost sold them for nothing a bunch of times cause I just wanted them off my portfolio hah. Let’s see what tomorrow brings
It tells you most people have no idea what they are talking about.
Same I just hope theres another dip tommorrow since new strike prices opened up.
IF YOU ARENT BUYING SIRI AND LMND YOU HATE MONEY
Me too. I bought 10 contracts for 10c expiring tomorrow. First time doing this.


Should I sell them before or after the conference?
Is there a catalyst or just hype?
If you bought before Wednesday, you’re not late.
Things like this are better kept personal.
I leave the rockets to DFV our lord and saviour.
If this King can hold... why the paper hands with a 2K invest can‘t?
Damn I’m in for 100 shares at market close
are we going to see two green fridays back to back???
BlackBerry is a software company specializing in enterprise software, internet of things, and cyber security.


They have a ton of valuable patents..

Their QNX software is in over 175 million vehicles.


Joined forces with AWS to make an intelligent vehicle data platform called IVY.  

IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud.  Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences



This stock touched the high 6s not too long ago. We told you guys it was gonna be big and to stop looking at them as a phone company.

When this stock hits 100+ how you gonna feel when you ignored us telling you could buy it for single digits and get long term calls for it that would give lots of tendies?
May your tendies be delicious.
Yeah so many people are still hooked on ZOM I am tempted to reenter and double my money again!

sorry i only do paper trades over rotary phones
Wow I’m surprised you dumped the 1/15s at this point. I figured since you were holding yesterday you were going to exercise to try to reach long term cap gains
You already know the answer.

Been holding ICLN for the past 2 weeks, really hoping he plugs it
I think we can realistically get BB to $20 tomorrow
They could announce a share offering in 2 weeks when the price is much higher. Seems more likely if they are going to do that at all.
Biden speech today has absolutely nothing to do with clean energy you dummies.

BB better be back under $10 by tomorrow’s close😂
Joe with the rug pull
I think you have much better odds with $ATVK - if the court rules in their favour (which is seeming likely all things to be believed with the SEC etc) then we should see a spike just due to the cancelled shares being bought back. That’s before we even see the real momentum from pink current today and future PR. 

Saying that $GME has wsb behind it so honestly who knows when it comes to those degens. 

My bet is $ATVK, but best of luck to you either way!

Graduating into Rona must absolutely suck, you have my sympathy. If you can finish a maths degree you are smarter than 75% of the work force at a minimum, it might take a while for your salary to reflect that, but it will do eventually as long as you keep making good decisions, learning new things and thinking strategically about the opportunities which arise. If I were you I would look into coding (it doesn't take long to know enough to get a job earning good money) or business intelligence. There is a lot of low hanging fruit smart people can pick in big old businesses, if you can do that a few times you'll do well. I've saved people literally hundreds of hours by making a little power query (literally not even coding, just excel) to compile multiple spreadsheets into one thing based of some webpages, if you can finish maths you can do that and earn well. Again you have my sympathy, but 5-10 years from now you can be absolutely rocking it.

Why is BB mooning?
If your mom freaks out over sensible, necessary expenses like computer repair, you should definitely join the adulting world and get your own account without her on it. She can still give you your allowance using PayPal or Venmo.

Just imagine how much she'll freak out if she sees you spending money on more interesting things like vapes, Only Fans, or hotel rooms.
Don’t worry, some people got out at the 10th floor, we heading up to floor 72
what was the expiration date?
I don’t have to beat anything.

My goals in life are different then the goals at the S&P.
It is extremely patriotic to go into BB & GME at the same time
There’s so much upside here. I’m buying leaps and shares and holding all year
I think about this too.  It's hard to time the entry into a value stock (or any stock in general) so I've added some momentum analysis to my stock picking analysis.   Momentum investing has been shown to be a strategy that has beaten the market. ([https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/momentum/](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/momentum/))  Waiting years for a value stock to pop seems to be putting money on the table that could have been used in buying other good companies where the market has begun to recognize their value.  Thus, if an undervalued company has stayed undervalued with little price movement in the last six months to a year, I just put it on the backburner and come back to it later.  There has to be upward momentum in the last three months before I pull the trigger and buy a value stock.  This is not sure fire way, but it has helped me to avoid undervalued stocks that have stayed in the doldrums for years.  A little over a year ago, I purchased $DIS at $151 after a recent uptrend in Oct - Nov of 2019.  It took a year where the stock didn't do so well due to COVID, but it eventually popped starting in November of last year as the vaccine got released.  I think it would have gone up faster if not for COVID.

I do have one exception to the rule.  My exception to the above rule is when I see a stock quickly decline (e.g., evidence of fear), and I may buy it on a pure price reasoning when there is no upward momentum.  Most recently, I did that with $GM at $25.84 a share.
I got 1000% off some GM 44.5 calls this week. The market is nuts.
It’s over 9000!!!!!
Atvk will go up tomorrow for sure, probably in the final hour.

Try to buy a dip if there is one, this stock gets attacked with fake news tweets all the time, buy those dips.

I think shares are when you share your wife. Or your mom.
Unemployment rates here in EU aren't that high, but a whole portion of the economy is being bankrolled on government dime. Quite frankly it's a sight to see, since we've been almost beaten to death by austerity proponents less than 8 years ago. Times, they are-a-changin'.
That Biden economic plan looks far too ambitious and costly. No way it passes even in a dem majority senate?

UVXY closes at 10.01 on 01/22. 

You're down 31$ in shares. You're down 58$ on the Put. You're up 70$ on the Call. Net loss of 19$.

That's the worst case scenario and I think it's far more statistically probable than you'd consider at first glance.
lmao what is old is new again
Come up with a price target you are happy at in 1/3rds, sell 1/3 at the price you are content with, 1/3 at the price you hoped for, and 1/3 at the price you can brag about.

Is anybody else losing money in this market or am I the only one?
Locked in on my $10c 1/22/21 🚀
It's 42% annualized

Meaning it costs $4.6 a day to borrow 100 shares
My man thank you
I’ve never bought leaps. We are talking $15 Jan 2023 calls?
Someone explain exactly what to do in robinhood and I'll do it. Get me in on this fucking retarded train

My jan23 10c are loving it
All in ATVK
I've had $9 calls for tomorrow for a while.  I had given up on them lol
WOOF WOOF 🐶🐕🐩🚀🚀🚀📈
[Oh phew so these BB YOLOs i bought at 3:55 WILL PRINT??? 🚀🚀](https://imgur.com/a/fxTbdFy)
Tesla already has a 27% margin....soooooo.  Tesla's can sell $10K software to a $35K car and do all the time.  Future FSD will be subscription and bring in around $100K+ lifetime profit for Tesla, per vehicles. So yeah, that's how you get 300% profit margin on "cars".
LMAO
Is it too late for me to be $BB 😞
Selling puts to the fools who keep buying.
Same man, it was hard not to cash in today.  But yeah, it will probably run, they call me paper balls.
This is how you know you’ve pissed off big money.
No more shares to borrow to sell short.  Can't keep the price down anymore.
Ok fine I’m selling my AAPL and MSFT and going all in BlackBerry tmr at open 😤
It's "our" girlfriend
BB 10.5c are actually gonna print... I love this sub
I’d sell. Games are moving to online downloads. You have to install games now even if you have the disk so I don’t  really see the point besides being able to re sell the copy.
My IWM calls may be Fucked
I’ve seen more companies have a permanent telework solution (like 2 days in office, 3 days from home) so there seems to be more flexibility.  But I hate working from home...
I hope you find the work arrangement you’re looking for!
$1400 stim payments vs $2000 estimated. And 1.9Tn vs 2Tn. Bearish?
You can’t do anything with options after hours you can only buy and sell during market hours
F. I should've bought FD calls on BB instead of these boomer shares.  It would've been easy 100%+ instead of this gay 15%
I wonder if GME can sell people some RTX3080s. Gamers always need hardware.

I’m jk but around $8 this am I was up like 340% at close. If this shit opens above $10
No. .0726 per share * 100 shares per call option * 1000 options 

He would have been down $7260, BUT that’s the book cost. In reality it would have been far more of unrealized gains when you factor in the price of those options at the time.
He collared his shares while everyone else lost everything in the crash, so he had a non-luck home run right out the gate.

I'll keep an eye on it. Now the company has been restructured I would hope for some creeping returns.

Lol what? The case for energy to suddenly become a massively high margin industry is really fucking retarded. Tesla has a margin and earnings problem, not a growth problem.

Tesla insurance will be puny at best. Probably ultimately will partner with a real insurance company because that'll be much much much cheaper. Insurance is also...as you might have guessed...a hyper competitive and also very low margin industry.
Help. I want to buy a call in BB. What would be a good starting point?
At least edit it so it fits current events on wsb
Really, why aren't you getting more credits for this?

this is amazing, can we get another analysis tomorrow on here?

you are the GOAT
This... I thought I was being crazy for dropping 10k on leaps... I was crazy stupid for not dropping more - GUH
If $GME hits $45 tomorrow, you can just buy Microsoft.

Yes sir!!!!!
Still holding
it's the new GME hop on now
I just checked my TD account. Next to my shares it says: "Fitbit Inc. CSH MRG @ 7.35/sh 1/14/21" So it sounds like it will be paying out the 7.35/share. Hopefully that lands in my account tomorrow.

I grabbed 2 $BB 1/29 8c with a 8.33 strike this morning. My only regret was not buying at least 10.
ALRREADY OVER $10 AFTER HOURS
Shh. I'm selling these for AMAZING premiums.
Generally due to the fact that interest is 24%pa and we have incredibly stringent financial product standards so it's harder for younger people to get approved for a credit card.
Its down 10% lol
Blasphemy
My Jan15 900C would like that, down 90% right now
yeah thats the one thing my grandpa would tell me is don't think bonds are safer then stocks because if you invest wisely stocks are safer and more money. Bonds always confused me anyway lol
Sold BB 3 days ago, got EOSE instead 🤡
It could be worse, you could have hedged your shares with put options and paperhanded them before they printed?

Alright you degenerates, first GME, now BB. What's the next play for WSB cash cows?
I love you degenerates! It's 2021and I'm making money on Gamestop. A year ago I would have laughed if you said I was gonna own GME again!!!

The fact that this is a WAR i can finally get behind (didnt enjoy extended spring break with my 30k frat brothers), make me proud to serve with you fuckers! Buys placed at $42 and $48. FUCK Melvin! FUCK JP! 

This is for Honor! They go down or we do. I am so God Damn Hard right now! 

It is an Honor to Serve with with you Fine Retards! 

TOO THE GOD DAMN MOON!!!
Yeah enquiring mind want to know when we are supposed to take the profits out? You're not even trimming so what's the exit strat bro
I thought infrastructure was part of it
HOLY BB
I’m gonna come find you if I lose money on my 100 shares

You can’t fuck this squeeze up
Time was today. From tomorrow the IV on this will be craazzzyy. Go big. If you can get an option for 30c next year. That's what I want.
Look at you, moving up in the world
wow batman... look at BB go
Yep. 15 years ago and I will never forget it. You’d better believe my daughter will know to stand up and walk out the door if that ever happens to her. I was the only woman consultant and it was the most miserable job I’ve ever had.
If you're talking about GME, the implied volatility on the calls (currently 260-300% as I'm looking at them) is too high to make good profit, unless the price just goes absolutely through the roof. Shares are the move for GME right now. If you just asking in general, calls are potentially more profitable than shares, but without the inherent value of shares.
Literally ever platform has done this to Trump. Not quite sure why twitter is taking the big hit for it lol
Hello Dad!!!
Had similar experience, bought shite UK stocks back in feb. Lost about 40% in October when I sold. Since then I'm up 350% up. Mostly on XPEV, TSLA, NNDM, AQB, TLSS
FCEL going to rip tomorrow
Why not Zoidberg?
Damn.
#BB
Pray bidens speech pumps?
Wow thank you for all the feedback, saving this!

1. I agree that it should work this way. I need to find a good way to toggle between syncing them and not. It's hard to not keep cluttering up the UI.

2. Going to add Vol and OI to the menu soon

3. This is definitely a bug, that shouldn't happen.

4. I didn't think anyone would need more than 2 expirations but I am learning I was wrong, I hope to fix this eventually.

5. This is how all calculators I've seen do it. It can be a little unexepected but the reason is the expiration price of the first expiration is unknown. Essentially there is an infinite number of sub-charts that could be generated depending on where it expires at. For example, if your first call expires at $350 and then the underlying goes to $320 a week later, is different than if it expires at $340 and then goes to $320. My upcoming solution for this is to maybe be able to hover over the prices on the first expiration, and expand the chart based on what expiration price you selected. This will take a while to get done though.

6. I like this idea too. I was thinking maybe a range slider (with a start and end) to select what range it goes around. Then the problem is that most people just want to expand the entire range so they have to drag two things now. A lot of issues fall into this category because don't want to make the UI too crowded to support all these use cases. I'll keep thinking of the best solution.
next week please be pltr week
interesting, so if u think this is not the squeeze, how will you make the determination when the squeeze has begun? Any particular metric?
Yo BB wtf I should have listened forgive me
And there goes those BB boosters. ARE YOOOOOOU READDDDYYYYYY!!!!!
Rip taxes
retard question here, LEAPS are just calls with long ass expiration dates right?
Exactly. It's going to get sick of this Chiti "sell" rating, and the sell off these past few days, and will flex it's every increasing new contract gains and rip.
$BB I wanna go to Mars !! 🚀🚀
My PP is erect with BB
Hopefully after the speech/ during pre-market it will fly again
Yeah. Libertarians for censorship, who would have ever thought?
I am in the adulting world, i have a job and everything, I get paid tomorrow. My mom just insists on me having this joint account
that's why we haven't made that kind of money. this takes an absurd amount of luck and diamond hand retardation. I would've sold when it first spiked to $19 a few days ago

I've never actually looked at silly crayon drawings seriously or even considered FA to be of any importance before, but now that I have literally all my money on AMD calls and I'm shitting bricks at the moment, can one of you smart mofos here tell me if they're looking good or not? Need some reassurance here, my confidence is hanging by a thread.
Fuck yes
Sold almost everything to yolo it into GME

I just got 2.2k from a stock CTF. I'm 17 turning 18 and live in the UK. Should I wait for the value to build as stocks recover from corona or move it into an ISA? Sorry if this is a really basic question.
you literally just state its a stock gain, and just leave it at that. They prob ask for your broker statement and thats it.
Wish I held. Sold my 7.5c’s 1/15 2 minutes before closing only to see it jump past $10 after closing.
Bought 1 share of BB at close, ready to let it ride tomorrow LFG
They always seem to run up then sell off after earnings.  Bought a ton of OTM JPM puts expiring tomorrow, not smart, just did it.
This is why I have so much ARR and PSEC, I get so much money from them it is insane.
I bought $47c earlier today, contract is already 46% higher. Premiums are insane tho :/
As a seller you doubt there would be buyers?
That's what's so beautiful

I would if I had the $
1.) Congrats on making $100. It’s profit and no amount of profit should be minimized when your new. 
2.) If you’ve been doing calls and puts/ day trading then stop. Right now. You have more then enough evidence in front of you, telling you day trading is not for you. 
3.) End the “lottery ticket” mindset right now. Instead, Buy stocks/ETFs from reputable companies with good track records and history and THEN HOLD. For years not weeks. There are threads everyday on this very subreddit with excellent stock and ETF recommendations. Use them, use Motley Fool, Cathie Woods, Barrons and others with actual documented positive track records.
4.) New players Should Never try day trading until they have done serious time simply investing in stocks, learning to understand the market and doing the proper research. You could have simply bought an ETF and made way more money in the same amount of time. I’m not saying this to make you feel bad, but this was a rather easily avoided stepping stone. We’re in a bull market after all.
6.) stay away from YouTube guru’s. Out of the hundreds of people on that site there are only like 2-5 worth watching and none of them are right 100% of the time. The absolute rest are garbage, click-Bait morons, who are out only to make themselves money and no one else.
I dumped my 1/15 GME calls at 11am today and bought as many contracts for 1/29 BB as I could. Up 200% since then
When?
He said $2k check after we got $600.  Neither of those is a $2k check.
Joe Bidet is such a pedophile with dementia.
I bought 20 $9 calls for BB this morning for .19 cents.
How come?
With what money?

Just hold and continue contributing to them. You picked really good stocks/ETF's for a first timer, you're just overdiversified imo. ARKF and MSFT are great choices, but they're my least favorite of the 8

Better to use existing systems to balance things out on the back-end like raising the earned income tax credit yr over yr.  Warren Buffett's been pushing Democrats in that direction, but the fucktards like those catch phrase meme legislations abit too much. Not on the brighter side of things they could accomplish.

Yessir I’m going in
My experience has been exactly the opposite... I usually have 2 limit orders set on anything I'm actively trading. One below the current price that will buy the dip and lower my cost basis, and one above the current price that will take some profit. I'm happy with either scenario. The mid-day doldrums from 11:00 - 3:00 are when nothing good is usually happening for me.
BB is gonna love this. We are mooning AH
Train started today! Get on board!
Happy birthday you piece of shit. Congrats and fuck you on your gains
Holy shit those fucking retards. Nevermind the short cover is humungus, my bad. Still new to options. For initiating the squeeze, they would cover tomorrow I was thinking (unlikely), initiating a gamma in their favor whilst effectively covering at their absolute minimum before it moons. Also I just realized that it would take a long ass time for them cover instantly. A lot of those covers will have grown quite a bit.
What happened to xiaomi today? Sb knows?

1400 (600 + 1400) was clear from the beginning. Biden himself posted it a few days ago on twitter.
This, someone make a good meme, will get this shit started
Did you buy this AM?
I wanted to see it steady for a week or something before putting more in but here we are lol
hmm if you want to be safe id say stay with GME but ATVK can reach 1$ or maybe even more but its risky so up to you, Risk vs reward mate
Did I say anything about Cuban? I suggest that you learn how to read (and type) before you spit nonsense.

SPACs are practically identical to one of the most famously stupid examples from a famously stupid stock bubble.

Think we will see a big pop tomorrow, expecting it to break the last two days highs and if it cracks $24 we could see a run to $28. Chart is primed for reversal plus Stimulus announcement! Buy some shares rn in after hours brotha, can only help!!!!
But I mean to say that say I buy a call for $20 and sell for $40, I'm covered, right? Like that is considered a covered call?
0DTE Options Questions:

On spintwig, it looks like 0DTE / 30D / HTE short put strategies consistently beat the S&P 500 (and other short/put strategies):

[https://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-0-dte-leveraged-options-backtest/#Compound\_Annual\_Growth\_Rate-2](https://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-0-dte-leveraged-options-backtest/#Compound_Annual_Growth_Rate-2)

[https://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-0-7-and-45-dte-leveraged-options-backtest/#Compound\_Annual\_Growth\_Rate-2](https://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-0-7-and-45-dte-leveraged-options-backtest/#Compound_Annual_Growth_Rate-2)

Under methodology it says "Timing 3:46pm ET". Does that mean the backtest sells puts 14m before close? Is that better than selling a put at 9am ET and letting it expire at 4pm ET?

Anyone have experience running this strategy?
Im getting in Tommorrow.  Can we keep this under 10$ till then lol

I did a partial exit today on shares at +119%. Will continue to blow off small pieces to de-risk and aiming to keep 50% in the tank for long-term growth & return of the dividend, which I locked in at something like 8-9% yield.

Longed 5 /ES contracts , we about to rocket back to 3813
I’m pretty much going to disagree.  Anyone long the option is more likely to sell than exercise, although I’d guess there will be some held through to expiry, more than usual to capture any squeeze energy through to the last minute.  The MMs who sold to them will have already been hedged.  Essentially what I’m concerned about is that all this money will come out of GME derivatives as the big option positions expire, there will be an effect on the stock.  A week ago, it looked like the expiring options were net heavy on the put side, but I think we’ve skewed back the other way in the last few days.  The past data was based on someone’s post where they dug into the open interest, and I’m definitely guessing on current oi.  Once all those hedged are unwound, that’s going to do something.
Shorts are pumping blackberry to distract us from GME. Sike bitch I’m 💎 🖐 🤚 both

Meme stocks
Whaaat? Are you telling me everything is propaganda? Like the way waves of cash roll into and out of sectors in a planned move? Pump it up. Slowly bleed it off, pump it some more. Let the bag holders pile in. Sell it all. Move to another downed stock. 


That would be manipulation and against the SEC regulations. That couldn’t *possibly* be happening.
Who knows. This is a good price to raise money at in any case. A higher price is better, but they have to be realistic. There's also a lot of buy demand. You want to do an offering while buy demand is setting in, not after it has set in. Otherwise, you crash the price.

I bought $3 2023 with some GME tendies
Or bed bath beyond
Bro same. Balls deep in April 30c
yes if you got a decent strike.
🚀🚀🚀

Also how the fuck do you get banned 5 times
RemindME! 3weeks
Wow, didnt know those calls were so far out of the money on friday. That is some serious faith in coming events. Well fucking done.
Just watched Deep Fucking Values YouTube boy these gains couldn’t have gone to a nicer guy so happy for him
Guh
$15min wage hike too.
I'm doing 3k!
Came here to ask the same. Someone in this thread mentioned the stock was going to moon today so.. I bought 20 calls $10 21Jan22. Thanks random autist!
Two months ago a $200 day would get me pumped haha.. life is good
Im literally spraying cum rn
Absolute Legend
TDOC gave kickass guidance and Morningstar upgraded their FVE to $225. Imo Morningstar consistently undershoots with their FVEs as they like to be conservative. Serious upside here imo.
How can you see this?
That sounds good but I’m trying to get the formula to plug into an algo. I’ll see if those things show the math though maybe i can copy and paste
Great bud, hope you still holding on
Ssssshhhhhh. The bots/algos don't know that, retard. Play along. Biden said $GME $50 price target!  🚀 🚀 🚀
If red again tomorrow buying more $750 1/22 puts as the whale has fortold
When do they expire
Fucking BB.  I got burned by them over earnings.  Shares and calls.  Cut my losses and got out.  Not sure if I'm willing to get hurt again by them
you're a mad man! congrats!
What's crazy to me is that, with everyone expecting a squeeze, all options are almost the same price.  For example, a 1/22 30c isn't that much cheaper than March 30c.  Time is free, because everyone expects the squeeze tomorrow.
What happened December 16th into the 17th?
Seekingalpha is hardly news
They said it would be 1400 in addition to the 600 already given. Total=$2000

I have a friend with a good government job and has been in the workforce for a decade now. They're 100% cash cause they're scared of investing. I tried to suggest they just go to their bank and open up something low-risk and professionally-managed but even that's too risky :/
What does this mean for the market?

Holy shit I owe you a beer

I'm a long time DE holder. They are also using tech to optimize crop yields and for a ton of other stiff. Aside from the tech aspects others have mentioned (which are excellent) they are also a solid company with good management, a good balance sheet and pay an easily sustainable dividend.

BLACKBERRY GOING UP AFTER GAMESTOP?

IS THIS BIZZARO LAND?
I held this for awhile and sold last week due to lack of movement. Any catalysts?
1400 + 600 that was just passed you idiot
💎👋🏻💎👋🏻💎👋🏻
I got out of BB last week so this all makes sense...
Hey hey just because TSLA has the flu this week doesn’t mean it’s not still our #1 meme
At least you only have to beat a few hundred local scalpers instead of millions of bots buying any stock online.
Could be fashionably late, never know... :) 

Welcome aboard!
MJ, CIIC, FDX, SSPK, ARKG, & STIC were all up pretty big today.

The MJ calls for $16 that I bought before the election expire tomorrow and are currently up 908%. If it's up tomorrow that will be my first 10-bagger. Unfortunately I only bought in for 10 contracts because my main plan was to exercise the contracts if they ended in the money.
You know damn well this idiot has also bought shares even though Melvin paid for this article! Or is he mad that he went to a prestige college and WSB is beating him?
If that happens my 8c will be so beautiful
That is 10x less interesting.
If they pass anything it'll be bullish.
CAN’T STOP
its in there
companies randomly chosen, but i imagine fast food doesn't pay over $15/hr
19 shares @ 30, here to help
I can feel that BDE through my screen.
Ah I thought the ones that sold them the calls must have had the shares to hedge. Then, when these calls would not be excersised, they would sell these shares again. But I hope you are right, gme shares are around 2/3 of my portfolio right now huehue, last few days made me a happy man already
A bullish morning doesn't mean a lot. A bullish close though indicates this stock can go a lot higher in my opinion.
I can make a list of names I saw on the first DD about this $TANH with all the sus awards. Seriously like 3 day old accounts talking out their ass. They don’t even hide it anymore, I can only imagine that he has like 10 screens up in his mothers basement. 

Anyway, I’ve got 90 shares just cause in cause I’m wrong af and tonight’s Biden news pumps it up hard
Does he think money grows on trees?
If it goes to 100 then yes. Rather than making 3x gains you could make 10x gains
It's at 10.75 now. What have you retards done.
I can't think of anything more retarded to invest in than BB so count me in
Congrats on the tendies
$3k on BB in solidarity.
No clean energy spending in this bill?
I for one, am totally shocked, that given a complete majority control of the government, the Democrats would choose to pussy out and show good grace to the GOP with a limp dick stimulus rather than ramming whatever they wanted down the GOP’s throats. 

Y’know, what the GOP did to them literally months ago. Remember how mad they pretended to be after the GOP shoved the new SCOTUS down the Dem’s throats a month before the election? 

SMH this is why Democrats lose all the fucking time. 🤦‍♂️ 

Doesn’t matter how “right” the Dems think they are if you won’t do what THEY themselves say they need to do to get what THEY want done. They could literally have 100% control of the government and still find some way to not get things done. Fucking hell
Fooking hell mate
definitely. well good luck. if you can’t get in tomorrow theres always tuesday
Push it to $15 before the long weekend 🚀🚀
I'm balls deep in GME and BB but it was an interesting theoretical for some free tendies
Are you that retarded?
If AMD could close the Xilinx deal like, now, that would be great
Idiots. I bought 100 @$19.  And sold a call for $22 strike on Tuesday.  Fuking Tuesday. If I waited 1 more day to sell the call (or didn’t) it would be worth about $2,3000 more. But nah.... lol
Check it now for number 9
It's gonna happen.  Just might not be for a long while.  And it won't be overnight, like gme
Flat like how I like my pancakes?
Man losing hair is so fucking Lame. I cant wait till it gets really bad so I can shave it all off.
Was just talking in general. Thanks for explaining
So calls?
What does LFG mean?:(

It’s my first day here :(
god i hope so. i'm buying calls tomorrow
No lol it's the covid relief stimulus
You right, by just a few minutes.  I faily.

Apple is going to have to raise prices on iPhone 12s to $1400
You absolute madman!  This has been an amazing ride so far!
Seriously, even if it drops and you’re in for the long term - just buy the dip. What we saw the last two days has just been some kind of adequate correction. I’m holding until 2023 at least. GME is the next Chewy
I don’t have to beat the S&P to earn money. Now you are simply talking trash. 

On to the next one.
I’m bullish long term but in case of a correction mid year want to make a play
I'm in 30c but 1/15 lol am I fucked?
You got RIMed boyieeeee
It’s getting delisted in November because it has Chinese military ties. This is super interesting because idk what will happen to all of the NIO investors, BABA, etc.. I’m gonna dump my NIO and Xiaomi on market open tomorrow.
DONE
The market is up 32% in the last 8 months, how did you do this to yourself
enjoy your lavish new lifestyle
Lesson 2 is a great way of keeping a solid pace for a stock. ( if that makes sense) for example you have $300 to invest, you think that the stock will keep going up, ok then put in $100 at open and let that ride to wherever it goes( let’s say the stock was $3 at open you put in that $100 then, and if it hits 3.50) then go in with another $100 and so on.
I mean, for someone young with a high risk tolerance and not a lot of money 30% in a year isn’t crazy gains. I know this isn’t the best mindset.
WTF is BB?
Fuck, market just closed and I have to wait for my deposits to go through because I like where my other positions too much.

&#x200B;

FUCK, LET ME ON THE ROCKET
A market maker will buy at a slight discount to intrinsic value (since its deep ITM) and simultaneously sell the shares short. It then exercises the call to cover the short, and keeps the discount as a profit.

It’s scraping up pennies, but it’s a risk less trade and done at super high volume. Market makers make money this way no matter what the stock price does.
I’m long on 8/9 strikes, 7.50s expiring tomorrow, and 8s expiring 1/29. I’m loaded up.
Oh man iTRADE is ass. I’m switched to IBKR
It has a dividend that will return later this year, if you're up 170% you probably locked in div at 10%, which is a great yield. I'd say take some profits at 2x and enjoy them, keep some in the tank
Need more stimmy to feed it 😢
I would be up 28000% if that happened let’s blast off 🚀🚀
Oh that little guy? Don’t worry about that little guy.

Just last weekend I sat the wife and her BF down to start watching Star Wars because she’d never seen any of them. I apologized for their having to watch that burning pile of shit that is Episode I but hearing the word “Wizard” again made it worth it.

Yeah, also realized that even if they wanna cover quick tomorrow before moon landing, its not something that can be done instantly without the market reacting so they prob would still average a really high buy price.
Had to repost this, please mods I'm just trying to harness retard energy!!

P.S. I'M STILL NOT SELLING🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
If tomorrow goes red, it was nice knowing ya’ll

Minimum wage doesn’t necessarily make the working conditions better but shifts the equilibrium and cause an increase unemployment
Lol yeah it is
Oh, dang, that means exercising them instead of selling forced market makers to buy more shares!  Hahahahaha
They were just purchased. In the agreement, sundial stock has to be above 1$ for 30 days before may. 

July 19 1c and .5c are actual free tendies. It’ll probably be around 2$ a share at it’s height.
I got some 54c woohoo cant wait to buy a house after this
Selling hasn’t even crossed my mind yet. Except to say I’m not fucking selling 🚀🚀🚀
4 9$ 3/19, plus shares we going to the moon
Yo we took $600 last month bruh
Ya'll memeing PLTR when you should get on the green train.

APHA & SPWR to the moon!

APHA 4/16 $11c, SPWR $30 2/19.

Both are up over 200% for me :D
30 shares now take me where NASA won’t go🚀🚀🚀
Why did I only fomo into 2 9c 1/15 bb contracts today lol
It will not. The increase in disposable income, and at that level people dont save, always adds more economically to businesses than any potential labor expense increase.
That's actually a great idea. I'm definitely going to consider it as a bond equivalent.
what will you do with the money?
Hold kid. We break 42 tommorow and it's a wrap 🚀🚀🚀
😘
No one experiences losses until they sell ;)
I don’t know lol. I think I am just desperate to hit a 10 bagger with calls.
He’s going to release the infrastructure one (likely with clean energy) later I believe so we might still get a pump
Biden’s having a speech tonight about a stimulus package and vaccines.
Wait through tonight and inauguration at least to see if that helps
held those 100 share for 2 mins... then accidently clicked sell... made $6... but it mooned %5 1 min later
Also, the way you use cover, I do not think it means that.  Or I’ve misunderstood.
BB GANG
Newer to investing and just want some advice because I'm having this issue of being really undecided. I am starting off with a Robinhood account and right now I only have about 400 dollars in, and I just want something that grows and has potential to break big. I plan on putting about 200 dollars a paycheck into my account to do this and was thinking about putting it in stocks around 10 dollars a share. One I was looking at is BB and I guess my question is, since it's such a small amount of money I'm investing right now, is it better to dump it all into one stock, or diversify? I see a lot of talks about ARK ETF's, should I invest in one of those also? I'm definitely want to hop aboard the clean energy train and technology and I'm pretty well versed in that stuff so this is more of a question about how I should initially invest. I'd also like some of the stocks that you think would be good to invest in at this point.
&#x200B;

after hours GUH bought 1700 shares at 1.17 LOL i'm so fucking fucked in my pee hole
I already finished multiple times, wdym?
Dear goodness my 2/19 10c are teasing me right now... They licking their lips and eyeballing me, telling me they guna transform tomorrow morning😏
I think he was referencing the lost potential profits if this stock printed a week later after his calls expired?
It is a genuine question - do you really feel extremely bullish? Curious
Haha Buyden wants to bring a peloton to the WH, PTON calls at open!!!
BB 10c 2/19 gang rise up
All you know it alls have no idea what you're talking about. Day trading is a craft that takes multiple years to be good at. Give the guy a break, there's a learning curve to it and you would experience too.
Buy BB calls at open
Anyone in JSDA (Jones Soda?). I bought it as a joke since I love Jones Soda, but it's gone up like 100% in the past month. It's a literal penny stock, and they got a new CEO. I ended up picking up 5000 shares which makes up a really small amount of my portfolio. Maybe they'll turn it around with this new CEO?
My god BB is ripping. Can’t wait for 5 year ATH
When you cut your lead act, the shows just not gonna sell like it used to. Puts on twitter and dummy ceo
Imagine browsing this sub in no meme mode 😤
Bad bot
It sounds like you're scared it's going to crash right? Just set a stop loss at 10% if your brokerage offers it

2/19
I love that it's already 10.51 afterhours NOW
No, I wouldn't. I'd consider it good for sure, but not massive. 

I held three stocks today that all jumped over 10%, and one over 20%. I'd say 20% is pretty massive.
I am in on this. BBBY and BB got options for both march 19. Love the B!
You'll have to look around for articles, but it seems as if right now the plan is going to wait till after the corona stimulus. Infrastructure budget will pass cause DEMS own everything, but it looks like it might be spring/summer. Not saying the stocks aren't going to rally strictly on knowing its coming though. Just if you have options it might be better to roll them out a bit in case the big jump comes in spring at the passing of the bill.

For somebody who hasn't been following this since 2019... What exactly was the ongoing motivation and vision into GME? I'm watching it run and I still don't understand the recovery it's made.
That's solid. 400 on top of you state unemployment is respectable.
10.51 afterhours ALREADY!
And Awomen
I dumped BB calls a month ago wtf is wrong with me
GME 50! DONT GET DISTRACTED FROM THE FREE MONEY!
Looks like FDs are the play sometimes. A few months ago we were all saying that leaps were the way. But nope, FDs really go gangbusters on things like BB.
Good question.   I wired myself 67k out of my account to my bank account.  Didn't lose it.  Was at 25k October 15 and now at 218k plus the 67k I wired out.
I mean at over a 1.5million users let’s say on average people have 3 stock.   That’s 4.5mil almost like the Georgia runoffs 😂.

i support this idea too
Its gunna be $0.00
BB is INSANE
It’s up 1.3% after hours
While I don't disagree it's overbought, is it as overbought as tech? Everything is overbought right now, so it's really just the small caps turn to moon. Everything will correct eventually.

Hoping to get an answer new to options and could only purchase 1/15/21 $35 back in December 9 and went ahead and got one 1/15/21 $55 today. You recommend wait until it expires at eod or just hope I can hit the highest stock price before closing?
Please everyone put the $1400 into PLTR. Asking for a friend
I don't put anything into mine, so it's purely "potential payout."
Yeah, need 2k for the gun and 2k for the 100 rounds of .223 these days.

Closing the Jan call would involve putting more money on the table, not taking it off. I sold to open the Jan call.

I was aware of the earnings. I was intending to hold through earnings on the Feb call - I didn't expect the Jan call to be anywhere near the money so I was anticipating buying to close it for next to nothing prior to earnings.
because that's what valuable companies do
Damn boys I’m getting in at open

I fantasize about working as an usher at T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field, home of the Mariners) in retirement. It’s one of my favorite places in the world and the ushers are always so sweet and kind. 

Since I don’t think I can talk my husband into moving back to the Puget Sound, I’ll probably either work in a nursery/garden center or we’ll pursue National Park campsite hosting. 

Basically, I guess I just want to surround myself with folks who have the same interests as me (baseball/hot dogs, gardening, camping) in a no stress environment.
God what an awful experience

BB stands for back in business baby!!

My account has been resurrected from the grave and vaulted into a new dimension thanks to my BB buying spree. Cashed out of all but 2 of my weeklies with the biggest gain being 4600% 

Still got leaps and she’s ripping after hours. What a fucking day.

what strike price sir?
BB will trade at $20 this year
Link?
Yes
I’m a girl and I’m going to roll them. chill.
It's tough to have the willpower though. You psych yourself I to think oh just one more dollar and it will go back up, one more, no, oh shit. Even if I tell myself 5% I'll try to renegotiate. Trailing stops are better for my willpower lol
These are all absolute dog shit
No ICLN buff, will be another month or so my Jan 2022 calls blood red :(

Lots of money for vaccines, PPE, family assistance, and $1400 check to everyone.
Roger.  Thanks.
No, but JPow makes money fly out of printers. The agenda to push for digital currency is advancing rapidly.
He might talk about the infrastructure bill though.
I like these guys that have practical comments. Like they just watched Michael Jordan sink one from half court, blindfolded, standing on one leg and ya know though he really could have had better form. Jesus Christ. You just witnessed greatness. Shut the fuck up and just enjoy it.
No pork disclosed, probably something in there.
When do you anticipate the peak? Tomorrow? Trying to figure out a game plan from reddit...is that smart? We'll find out
Congrats and fuck you
I bought shares and a few 25 fd calls to minimize the ouchies hopefully

The NYT says:

> It also features more help for workers and families, including $1,400 direct payments, more generous unemployment benefits, federally mandated paid leave for workers and large subsidies for child care costs.

Any price targets or other opinion youre willing to share? 
Thanks for the response
nice you'd make 10x? easily
I could have bought 2,000 contacts BB and if each one made 100 I could have been up 200k wow.
With MT and other steel gang stocks its important to keep track of the steel index. If the index goes up, the sector stock follows. Yes this week has been relatively flat but if you were in since a few months back the trend has been a steady increase. This isn't a quick weekly play but monthly play and long hold. Ofc you do you.
60 y/o father of two gamer sons here...I bought 1300 shares at ~$18 last week (week before?) after lurking on WSB for a while and thoroughly reading the DD for GME. 
Now up 113%. ($25,000 turned into $50,000)That's a year of college tuition. 
I'm long, since I'm at the age where LTCG taxes are preferable to STCG taxes.
Thank you, you magnificent bastards.
roaring kitty
Fuck it, I’m in.
You could be right! I feel like this is such an unusual scenario, it's hard to gauge. My gut tells me dip, but it isn't a normal stock rising under normal circumstances so it could just shoot past every expectation. Still, no matter what 💎👐
Link or ban
GME and BB
Shouldve been on gme
Right there with you rip us
Probably not in this one. A separate infrastructure bill is going to be proposed.
Let's drink it on the moon 🚀🚀🚀
How do I get em
And he essentially held LEAPS until they were weeklies.
We don't get to the big hills on the rollercoaster until tomorrow.
Too deep, didn’t read.
Because Trump was the only product they really had to offer, now it's just screeching.
There aren’t any open leaps for how high this MFer is gonna be ($50+), just keep grabbing weeklies
This retard needs to stay here
Thats not what Dems were just talking about.  Just yesterday it was $2k straight up.  Now its your gay bear math today.
Better to pay taxes on any gains than end up getting buttfucked into a tax refund.
Never said I was betting against anyone.

Cloud gaming is years away from technical viability. Fiber has to expand across the US before it has a chance.

No PC digital storefront can compete with Steam. Epic and GOG are the closest and they practically have to buy their customers away. The other players are the ones with IP on their platforms like Blizzard and EA.

Where does GME fit in from a technical perspective? Itll be interesting to see how Cohen plans to disrupt an a very well understood industry. It's pretty pointless to return a PC game digitally when people will just back up saves and then pirate single player games again.
I agree with the recommendation to reduce your size. You'll be better able to control your emotions if the trade goes against you. Then scale up as you gain confidence. Also, don't beat yourself up if you miss the first move. You've probably noticed that the top gainers each day tend to have more than one move.

Bad baba
$33 ICLN is totally doable with a Biden pump tonight
IV I guess. I sold already.
Got only 421. Some money stuck between banks. Who knows, maybe we will see some dip tomorrow and I will add some more, but highly unlikely.
1 SELL = 1 PUNCH IN YOUR PENIS AND/OR VAGINA. WE DONT DISCRIMINATE HERE.
User name checks out. So, decide what / how many etf, growth and dividends you want. Maybe choose between div & etf’s but not both

I’m literally on the same boat lol I’m not trying to get butt fucked round 2. Can’t trust a company that is still best known for a scroll ball and phone that turned sideways cool
See honey I knew we would break even eventually!

BB doing things AH 🍆😳
Clitoris is a great place for stimulus. Probably should work the inner thighs for 5 minutes before you go stampeding to the clitoris
Why is BB pumping anyway
Why?? Mitch gone my man
Daddy how do you betray us and not excercise ;-;
You’ll be able to pay someone to do that after that play 🚀
What’s the deal with FVRR?
Yea sold my June calls for a slight loss and will jump in later on. Better plays out there
Spy 🚀🚀 tomorrow. Heard it here first
Ticker symbol for “Blackberry”
Not the right sub
Let’s hope so. Im holding SPY, ICLN, GME & TSLA calls.
yeah but they beauty of an ETF is that her team rebalances it every day. unless you have the ability to do that every day, its not worth it.
So he's gotten into EVE Online then?
I'm curious if I should swap over to JP Morgan commission free investing from Robinhood. I've always heard lots of bad things about robinhood, but would JP Morgan investing be any better? I already use Chase for banking and that's why it's the option I'm looking towards.
I had a few hundred in GME, now I have a few thousand.  DeepFuckingValue has delivered beautifully.
What’s everyone’s predictions for BB long and short term? I’m in for 300 shares today.. only a  small timer but trying 🚀🚀🚀
serious fomoing. i just bought a 100 at 10.52
You missed mentioning that none of those institutions sold when the price hit around $6 they've held and also there has been no Insider activity for the last 3 months

Been in this for a year now.
Pause
When do they expire fam buying some leaps first thing tom
Got some NIO FDs before close. Wish me luck
Well done. Well fucking done.

DFV HANDS!!
Could only buy 45 shares, but Im with you! 🚀🚀🚀
Up %50 on clorox and ups already and im down %30 on BA
Started to try swinging today 🎢 got out at 38, too early. Wanted to get back in but it just didnt go beneath 38. So I yolo’d everything in BB which I will catapult in GME again. Hope ur right
Jesus fucking Christ. What kind of monster is this?
Made 4600% on my $8 cals I got yesterday for .03 each.
WSB has some huge wins. Thetagang always wins (or rolls for a credit).
Soooo I had 350 1/15 10Cs average cost 0.14. Sold at 0.35.

Bought 250 1/15 11Cs average cost 0.2.

I feel like I could’ve been better off diamond handing.
Will GME continue to rise? Considering buying 50k worth rn
Same
Why is it though, they sold some of their patents but don't know why it should go up much more?
Just throw it all into a hood index fund and by the time your 60 it will be 7 figures.
My friend was bearish in April 2020, is now bullish. Kinda scared by this
Student loans?
won't stop them from calling it 2k
Does this mean they're officially cyclical?
BB has already moved on without you. She got thousands of other autistic dick to enjoy
Can’t sell my Bb after hours ugh
Woulda shoulda coulda. Didn’t.
That guy is dead to me, if this is really the case.
GME ABOUT TO BREAK 40
You didnt?
its ok tho, tis just a drip in the bucket.
I feel not putting enough on a play you feel good about and selling too early, always feels worse than a loss. 

With a loss you can move on, with the other two you keep on calculating you hypothetical profits.
Sir, we're going to need you to step over here and get de-loused.
I think I'm gonna go with the $10 01/22 BB calls. Thoughts?
Awesome man.  This is the best thing to do.  Just don’t sell those til we’re on the other side of $60.
Welcome to politics. If you think both sides aren't the exact same then idk what to tell you
Tesla just released a microinverter.. is ENPH fucked???
Yes, the 1,400 is another stimulus that would go with the extra 600 to equal 2000$
I wouldn't bet on retail right now. Biden admin is planning 15 dollar federal minimum wage hike. Retail will be hit the hardest by this.
Dems love spending money, it’ll pass no problemo

lol yep... 10c would've been bank... hahaha
Wow, nice job
We're over 10 already wtf is this!? Ahhhahaha
It’s the most undervalued EV / auto stock in the game. By far.
you got it
Using /s on reddit usually means you're being sarcastic so you probably want to start using (s) for future points to not come across in a wrong way
Calls on big booty
Craziest thing is how cheap those BB calls were even at EOD
A lot of the base metals have doubled or tripled in last months. They way late on their calls.
You’re high. They’re not doing any more half measures.
You hate it because you don't understand the current state.  The solar roof is on the 3rd generation and ramping up quickly.  Tesla is on a hiring spree around the country and will be growing the solar business dramatically.  This is just the start of the Tesla energy S-curve.  With huge solar installation comes WAY more Tesla energy storage grid level systems.  Another exponential and disruptive business.    

I'm sorry, but you're a straight up fool if you think any legacy auto maker has the same software chops as Tesla.   Tesla is literally rated the top choice for engineers to work.  Autonomy can't be solved with money and employees.  You need the top 20 smartest people in the world in a room, which Tesla can do.

Why do y'all invest in BB lol, new meme stock?
Still time to get in SPCE before they announce test flight date, and Cathie scoops up shares!
I honestly think people are following us now and wanting to get in on next GME. Look at BBBY today as well which has been touted here for a while. Next up are the Steel stocks. Tons of stocks frequently mentioned here went way up today. Now is this a good or bad thing is tough to say. Obviously tendies now are amazing but what about when everyone is aware of our next moves. Soon there may be a whole segment on CNBC about WSB.
Just waiting a few years for AOC to gain more clout and experience so she can ram all the Pussylibs and repubtards with her massive progressive policy strapon.
Yeah it was cheaper to buy shares than options for bb
Figured it was a withdrawal but was deep down hoping it was just a big L 😂😂😂gotta love wsb
Because we want to Bro, just Yolo
Just ordered a 12 dollar call expiring jan 29th. It still needs time to execute. Good call or nah?

Bought 100 shares of BB and 5 calls for some reason. Thanks WSB
Put $5K on BB.
Dumb question, but is the distribution of price and expiration date are across the 71.2M knowable?
Roaring kitty
Thank you! I got a free trial after I saw this! Can confirm 77.440M is the estimated short interest (mooned last few days)... 

&#x200B;

Fucking retard shorts get fukd
what strike you buying
to be able to do that successfully through options, the stock would have to raise 75% higher than the option strike. Assuming they started shorting around 10.
Why no options? IV?
What's the next move!??!??!?! TELL US OH LORD DEEPFUCKINGVALUE!!!
Bagholding facebook.
I got 15 shares and I ain't selling!!! 55c guarantee!
Ah nice! Congrats on the milestone lol
Is FB a buy? Or is this seriously going under $200
FCX - Its been vertical for awhile but the copper rally is going to run for years. I've got way too many energy picks lol but the entire market is only just beginning to recover and I'm convinced we'll have $70+ oil by '22
Should have had the treasury go all in on GME calls. Only way to pay for all this.
Who would've thought if I'd put my money into blackberry instead of GOOGL and MSFT I'd actually make money
Sell the news time?
Yooo I know
Yeah pretty wild. About 2.4% of Americans decided 2020 was the year for them.
i lost some profits but still up. shouldve pulled out my initial investment yesterday but oh well.
Some guys really tryna tell me Addison Rae isn't hot. I think they might be gay
Already hitting the strike after hours! Love it!!! 🚀
2006
Biden’s proposed Covid relief is almost all directly targeted at the individual level. Limit up. ⬆️
For every options contract you want to exercise, you need to own 100 shares of said stock to back the ability to exercise it. If these are naked calls, he wouldn't already own the shares to exercise so he'd need to purchase them first. Or something like that. Fuck IDK.

I'm pretty fucking stupid so take it with a shaker of salt.
BB is mooning right now after hours.  Started investing after new years with $100, I'm going to have $800 by the end of tomorrow thanks to $F, $BB, and $GME
no fucking way you held
Sounds great. Good luck 😁
Easiest way to make a small fortune...
Nah he doesn’t he basically just says the wsb is in on the short squeeze and is driving the price up. Hedge funds do this everyday lol
BB is flying to fucking pluto 🚀🚀🚀
You should be beating the s&p for the amount of risk and time you’re putting in. Would you rather have 1 or 2 dollars?

GME 40 looks like it’s new $37
What is this, 2007?
What’s the plans on GME? When do I sell?
Anyone betting on a 130C 1/29 or 130C 2/5 on AAPL? Earnings on the 26th. Historically Apple has beat their estimated earnings too.
I only bought 16 **BB** $12C 1/15/21 @ $0.12
What do you think about $7.50 July 15 call?
Idk I grabbed 3c just because the price was so fucking low that I figured I’d get near guaranteed profits with great upside, I’ve seen a lot of people go 10c, the prices are so good you can just decide where you want to go in terms of risk reward.
Are you a fellow wsb artard?
Their name rhymes with fuckfaceschmelvin crapital.
I literally FOMO’d 1 min before close at $9.10 per share, super glad I did 🙈🚀🚀🚀🪐💍🙏🏽
My icln 35c for April is in pain rn but diamond hands
How do I buy after hours on TOS
I think SPY and ICLN will do well but TSLA could really rocket next week.
Anybody see it go to $11 after hours just now? What in the world is going on??
The fuck do you know, Mr. One Post.
GME ABOUT TO BREAK  $40 GET IN WHILE YOU STILL CAN
I think that's too many B's
Icln pltr crsr...
Literally did *exactly* what he said to do with APHA and woke up to $340 gain. Unfortunately only 1c because I was nervous but certainly not complaining.
Now do this in bear market pls :)
CRSR
This is by far the best EV play rn! Chart looks incredibly primed for a reversal and I expect a major breakthrough tomorrow! Personally expecting $24 min EOW this week! The fact that the price dipped to the 21 day EMA today is insane, such a great buying opp. Highly recommend people buy shares before the Stimulus announcement in a few hours! This is going to boom tomorrow!
Gonna buy more tommorrow🚀
A lot of this is probably reactive, but social media companies have really gotten themselves into a fight with no good outcomes regarding free speech, and their control of it (exactly what the Founding Fathers intended...the government can't limit free speech but a handful of billionaires who own the principle platforms for free speech can). Even Jack Dorsey came out acknowledging this is a problem, while still wanly defending the Trump ban. My equally wan defense of these social media companies is that they are kind of painted into a corner by being bombarded about stopping that disinformation that has not first been cleared by official gatekeepers, putting them in a position where they are under a lot of pressure to act, at the same time that doing so butts up against basic American values. From an investment perspective this doesn't seem to be a good place to be, and personally I have exited the modest social media positions (Twitter and Facebook) that I had.

Have fun with that shitshow lol
I plan to trade with a larger account of like 5k very soon. With that account I will take few positions. I know I can grow it over time with compounding profits and deposits. I will not want to put this account much at risk if I hope to grow it to 100k.

But at the same rate I’m fine toning my skill set to trade larger scalping account of say $1k

Because of my options trading past it prepared me well to lose money and take risk. 

I’ve lost a lot of money in options basically gambling. 

Pretty willing to do the same with forex but only small accounts because of how liquid it is. 

I wouldn’t want to run my larger account as my scalping account and will not.

But I’m just that kind of person I will not be happy until I got the badge of being able to grow small accounts to bigger ones.

You just can’t do that in 24-72 hours proper risk management. 

 I wouldn’t advocate to do the same unless you have two accounts. 

I’ve taught the same for those trading stocks and want to learn options. I’ve sold my stocks so many times to buy options is sickening so I trade different accounts so that I can do so!
Thank you for enlightening me!
This sub is getting way too much attention , every financial news website is talking about us. Watch them end all you retards by telling their MIT engineers to scrap this website and inverse all of you retards.

These companies have highly inflated P/E ratios. I would not worry one bit about a drop in their market capacity.
Perhaps after a board meeting or in march when they report ( like they said they would do in December ).    Wonder if Cohen would reject it so the stock price stays on target...  they have plenty of money.
Buyden Good.

Gotta respect the retard.

Here’s what Biden calls for:

Direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans, bringing the total relief to $2,000 including December’s $600 payments
Increasing the federal, per-week unemployment benefit to $400 and extend it through the end of September
Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour
Extending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of September
$350 billion in state and local government aid
$170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education
$50 billion toward Covid-19 testing
$20 billion toward a national vaccine program in partnership with states, localities and tribes
Make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable for the year and increase the credit to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for a child under age 6)
There was a chance he’d mention his infrastructure bill plans but that’s not confirmed at all
Is it too late to buy into BB??

Australis capital is only at a market cap of about $70M and is easily worth $500m by year end in my opinion.
Side note, definitely still feels like 2020. Not much has changed and it's all a blur of awkward holidays and events.
I put my entire net worth into this 6509 and I'm not getting out before 100.
🥲
Trying to slow it down.  Good luck. Brrrrrrr
Bought AMD and I’m not sure how I feel about it.

just consolidating, shit doesn't just go up like an elevator. More like steps
My best tip would be to have a trading journal to track every trade you make. And then monthly or quarterly go back and analyze which trades worked and which didn’t, and why. This is how I’ve improved
Im sorry but I dont understand WSB GME thing. What the fuck does gamestop have to offer? Nobody buys hardcopies of video games anymore. Yall are buying calls on Blockbuster and making money can someone more autistic than me explain the deal here?
It’ll come to about the same profit you’re fine
In the 10s already so you're going to make some serious cash! All I have's 5 3/19 $10 calls.
Me too; I feel you. I rarely even buy FDs, but still have solid gains. Wsb is just too good not to follow. Feeling like a boomer over here, though
he feels it's easier to scroll through a single thread instead of opening up a thread to see the content every time something seems interesting.

Part of this is going to depend on how you view reddit, as well.  I believe new reddit lets you see a few sentences of the OP on each thread like an email preview, which can facilitate scrolling through a lot of threads without any additional effort; people like me who are either still on old.reddit or have some style plugins, or use third party apps and don't have the thread's summary displayed w/ the title, find the daily format significantly easier since there's no need to click in to see discussion.  There's strengths and weaknesses to both method.
I've know nothing about options.  Can you ELI5 what $9 2/19c means?  Only thing I know is that the contract expires on 2/19?

I agree with hold_onto_yer_butts the kids need to remove these types of posts to stop this becoming personal fiancé. These types of posts don’t lead to a discussion, and instead will result in list of jobs that should be in the daily thread. I’d rather have the subreddit be moderated like it is then have it be fully of junk all the time.
Buy GOEV instead
My wife boyfriend bought me a switch from GameStop!!!!!
Written like someone who works at a hedge fund. GME 🚀 🚀 🚀
GUH
Chuck it at the sky!
Yeah might be time to sell it off. Who knows though, it could do well on OTC market? I don't know how that works
Which calls did you buy?
114$ per share.  I arrived at this valuation by searching for CHWY in my robinhood game and typing that number here.
Imma buy ArkX because Cathie works for the regular  joe.
Historically, its really jolted the market in a good way.  While this is a democratic imposed stimulus (possibly less direct support for companies) even getting cash to consumer will end up with companies to begin with.  

&#x200B;

The Market has historically generally responded well by given the populous a ton of checks.  No one just drops this into bank accounts, its spent.
BB up 14% after hours. To the moon tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀
Sigh.. All IN BB
I want this to be Biden's speech tonight: 

'We are unveiling a $10T stimulus for every American AND Canadian (I am Canadian) where they receive $5000 each.

The rest of the money will be for EVs, Clean Energy, all the disrupters that ARK invests in, and GME, caught burn those shorts that's why' 

&#x200B;

Now think of all the good this will do for America.
holy shit
You clever girl. ❤️
Sadly limited in capital as I’m only 19 but I do have 550 shares and 15 calls in July. Pretty great the past few days
It’s a buy if you hate America
Wow
If burry sold now he’s made like $110m
ICLN doin' AH things

Not at all, after posting it went from 13% to 20% 🚀

Considering how retarded WSB is, for sure it will rise.
Can someone point me in the direction or give me a TLDR on what’s going on with BB?
He's standing on steps in that scene
Thinking this myself

More stable stocks like airbnb? Lol.
XL better do a moon tomorrow
You should feel great. Its at a discount
There were talks of a $2000 check instead of the $600 which is what was proposed by both Trump and House Dems but wasn’t even introduced in the senate since Mitch McTurtle said no. So, most people got a $600 check instead. The difference ($1400) is what will be discussed in his speech today. Hope this helps clarify.
I will ask my mum 😁🚀
not OP. 

how does a call convert to profit? 

If the price is $8 today and $12 in March, with $10 call you can basically 
purchase stock at $2 discount? So you buy the stocks and then sell them for profit?
Here’s the thing, the short squeeze hasn’t even started yet.
Why bnb?
WE BROKE 40

I’m not making any statement other than they said they wanted to do some things once they got power. Now that they have power they’re not doing those things. Seems pretty slam dunk to me.
Why is BB popping
Interesting.  I've never heard of pensions where they don't require the employee to contribute anything.  Is this a gov't or private employer?
Wait, are you talking European or American options? I am thinking American.
With the new stimmy incoming and possible sector rotation out of tech, take some gains out of tech and go balls deep in IWM calls. Thank me later with a ride in your lambo
lmao I know you think your kids are geniuses, but they're c-average at best on a good day in everything and fucked reguardless bro. take the free money.
Jesus BB I remember in December when we were all hoping for you to hit 9 or maybe 10 EOM, Fucking steaming past them now
Assuming he sells
Nickel is needed for EV so easily past $20
this push is due to FB whatsapp security concerns, BB has BBM
D,uh, why not rates are so low... What Im surprised is so many refinancing banks are willing to refi at such low rates, when rates inevitably climb and their stuck holding fixed low rates...won't that affect their balance sheet negatively..
I have the 1/15 $9 calls left and some 2/5 $8 calls. Had a bunch of 1/15 $8 calls too but I sold them all today.
Sure, but everything that works looks genius in retrospect. Would you dump $100k into AMC 1/2022 calls right now? Because that’s basically what the OP did. Shitty company with sub-$5 stock price, etc. 

People have been blowing money on GME for years expecting the past two days to happen, how come now one talks about those people? We all know why, because we live vicariously through posts like this. The truth is, this is just a winning lotto ticket. That’s all.
Never ever sell your entire portfolio, especially companies you have high conviction in. Sure, if you want to take half out maybe that's okay, but how would you feel if markets go higher in 2021 and you missed all the gains?
My best days were shorting tsla.  Hell I made 40k last week shorting tsla even when tsla had its best week in some time.
Stonks only go up baby boom! To the moooon!
There you go GME 🚀
yea this is the one with the ICLN pump, my 15 Jan 35c look to expire worthless. good thing i have april ones!!!
Starting to get hard. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
There will be movies made about this epic yolo move n short squeeze
Heck, if I saw a review that said "consistently and considerately parks between the lines in garage" that person would be good for the next year.  Team player, initiative, skills...that says it all.
so who of you autists broke the BB???

I wonder what explanation all "serious analytics" will find tmrw. :D

I have 10c 6/18. IV is high, but I think it’s worth it for the potential upside. Hoping for big news at their conference tomorrow

Sitting in 40,000 shares in my main account, and roughly 4500 in two other accounts.  20,000 of my shares have calls written against them expiring tomorrow, at $36.  And I sold 1550 shares at $38.50 right at the top of the spike yesterday.  I'm sorta debating what to do with the calls.  $36 was the top of my adjusted, readjusted, readjusted price target.  First I was at $21, then $24.  Then when we hit $22.50 the second time and there were few big sellers, I made it $32.  And I wrote CCs against it at $36.  I wrote those when it was near $28, and only got $1.80 in premium.  So.
Only thing I ever see on the shelves at a local bass pro is fucking bb pellets, some fancy ass shotgun ammo and like a box of 22 shot shells.  I think the only rifle round Ive seen in the past 4-6 months is some 6.5 creedmoor.
Lil sus
Sell at open
Trying to decide if I want to buyback the 35C 4/16 covered calls I sold I sold yesterday for $3.95 thinking there was no way GME goes above $39!   🚀🚀🚀
Paper balls are still better than the blue balls you get from not selling when you're up!

GME!
$41 GANG GANG
I’ve owned this since summer and it’s been a great performer. Don’t sleep on UUUU either, it’s @ $4.22 up .23 today and has been my best performing uranium stock of the 4 I currently own. The others are CCJ and yesterday’s purchase of URG based on OP’s post. 
 If uranium pops like it has in the past, the target will be Pluto and not the Moon!
Melvin/BOA have to be seeding stocktwits. A ridiculous amount of vague bearish comments when SW sentiment usually aligns close with WSB. 

I bet they’ve tried seeding here too, but it’s downvoted to oblivion so no one sees it.
Sold my PLUG 1/15 $60 calls early Monday for a loss before the jump. Sold my BB 2/19 $10 calls yesterday (literally no idea why). Bought only 5 GME 1/15 $25 calls Wednesday and panic sold 3 yesterday on a dip. After all that, I'm still almost up 200% on the month. Learn from your mistakes. This market right now was literally made for the most retarded of all.
finna dump all of it on GME 50c 1/22
Up only
I can't find him. What's the name?
What's the over/under on how we open at 6?   I'm locked into a position and am too afraid to say which direction.  

Don't want to jinx myself, haha
> Regulation requires control of the controller and since no one controls btc (except maybe the semi-obvious 51%+ mining share China holds) there's no way to regulate it outside of record keeping for users within the states.


Isn't the 'controller' the exchanges? Im not super familiar with crypto, but there has to be an intermediary between two people exchanging coins, correct? 

Couldn't they just force exchanges to follow similar laws as banks as far as identifying an entity or person as an account holder?
DONT STOP GME 🤤
Eh it’s a boomer stock.  Like coke or Pepsi.   You know that it’s mostly safe, I’d take the money and invest in something new.  Unless you want to play a long game their margin isn’t very good.  I’m also retarded and know nothing.   But even during the SUV days they weren’t setting up huge lines and sucking em up like a shop vac.
YUHHHH 40

That was some good shit. Made a lot of $$. Sadly it happened right before Corona wiped half this sub out.

I’ve literally never seen a person with more conviction in their positions and belief in themselves. This is truly inspiring stuff
GME broke the sell wall AH. see y'all on mars
F for clean energy and steel calls

When do you plan to sell? What's your end game?
#IS THERE ANYWAY TO INVEST IN BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO, PALM PILOT OR MYSPACE??
WTF JUS HAPPENED
Had 10x 1/15 $9Cs this morning, sold 6 when I saw them pop from .01 to .10 to cover my original cost basis (.06). Sold the rest around .40... really regretting my paper hands haha
Lol $55 strike. Wish you luck good sir.

#BB YOU AFTER HOURS BEAUTY
I bought $9c 1/22 OTM this morning, I'm creaming
I like your vibe-based stock picking method.
IS GME REAL WTF IS GOING ON
My days of BB accumulation are over on day 2. I told myself I wouldn’t buy over $10. Wish I had a chance to accumulate more considering I just opened a position yesterday. 😂
Bought at 11 @ $9.06. Where do we think this is goin? I’m thinking at least $20
Market dont care about that shit. Also 15minumim wage. Wtf
if you really want to feel better about ur GME positions, someone dropped 2.2 million on 1/15 45c, almost 20,000 contracts
The market doesn’t care about your feelings 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I actually have no idea what I’m talking about. You’re right. But numbers don’t lie, I started with 10K in November and now I’m at 45K. First time trader. 

You actually must be retarded to not be at least 25% in the easiest bull run ever.
Noice
WSB game plan... find most shorted stock and buy the dip
About to ride the lightning brother
Aw yes thanks really this sub is great for learning quickly

The borrow rate is a floating one; it can change throughout the day up to 2 p.m. ET. Rates fluctuate based on the security’s market value, demand, and available inventory. If fees increase beyond the amount you’re willing to pay, all you will have to do is buy to close your short position before 5:30 p.m. ET to avoid being charged. Once you enter a short position, you will find current rates by going to the Positions tab and hovering over the R icon.
i may have bought some.....  but it sounds like i shoudnt have ( unless everyone saying to not buy calls is only talking about weeklies ).
Guess I went too long haha. I have calls till Jan 22 at 10c
I think we will see a big day tomorrow, all we need is a little momentum. Feeling for you brotha, hopefully things get going and you can claw back some on those calls! Have you considered rolling them????
Lol why
Same here lol

I need to get rid of this PDT brahhhh
I have like 10 sharea of berry boi. :D can I join the party?
Thank you, figured it out. Any advice on legging in and out of spreads? Good idea, stupid idea?
According to this [DD](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxdn4u/gme_very_likely_to_go_to_47_or_more_tomorrow_480/), the volume is 70k as of now. No idea how its grown but id say at the very least is the market and not them. Either way I realized the short position itself is humungus nevermind. Just realized why deepfuckingvalue is a genius, or perhaps the shorts are retarded. In their defense tho, the RC gang pull up was probs not on their radar.

A covered call is when you sell a call and also own enough shares to sell to the buyer if they decide to exercise the option.

Yeah but who?!?
Oh I’m well aware. Just why we accept it is beyond me
\#GME TO MOON
If you believe in the short squeeze thesis as presented above, then yes, you would do exactly as you described.

In order to avoid bankruptcy the short sellers will have to buy buy buy in order to close out these positions. If you buy and hold shares as you suggested, not only will the value of your shares increase, but that takes available shares off the market, making it harder for the short sellers to close their positions, and squeezing the price even higher than before.

That's why everyone here keeps saying 💎✋ . Buy and hold no matter what, and the overextended short sellers become ever more overextended.
Because that obviously wouldn't lead to massive inequality. Bitcoins are a finite resource, almost all of which has already been mined. Without regulation it would never happen.
Inshallah
Yep, I'm half chinese and my mum gives me crap for even considering investing in Chinese markets. Stay away!
Yeah I'm up 30% for the past month and 90% for the three month, so I'm definitely not patting myself on the back for paying my broker to get me my 7%. I just like the tactile feeling of moving hundreds of shares around and for some reason I can just never get anyone to buy my damned options when I do hit it big with them. I think it's something to do with volume, but I didn't learn that until losing like 500 bucks on calls that no one wanted to buy.
GME 5 min. Chart looking like it’s about to absolutely BLAST OFF 🤞
I wish I had the cash to make the buy yesterday to brag to you about it today
Liking the GME and BB movement.
You are an idiot. 

Go back to r/destiny
Yeah just do good research before you begin and only invest in what you really believe has the potential to grow in the future. I just started investing like a week ago and have shares in 4 etf’s and 1 individual company that I really feel has the potential to grow within the next 5 years due to some research. I’ve gone up 10% of my initial investment. I know it’s too early to speak because of how unpredictable the market is but it’s a good start
Honestly I sold at 9.3, thought it would dump but holy cow up 14.5% AH... who knows where it will stop!
I could’ve bought 10,000 contracts for Tesla before presplit and I’d be up a hundred million
done did it!
Same brother 🚀
You can easily get burned day trading in this market buying shit if you buying blindly.  Take gme today.  It sold off from the open only to bounce back big.
That 53k OI for 24p is just hedging right?
That’s the wrong way to look at it. The stock price moves to factor in the dividend accrual. You understand that, surely?
Just did 🚀
will do!
Why potential? Didnt hear anything of them since 10years
1/22 8.50
The best part is the prices have to go up to accommodate the wage increase, so now everyone who made between 15-20 is comparably poorer after. And everyone who's making 15.50 as an assitant manager isn't getting a raise... so why do extra work for peanuts?

Insurance is only hypercompetitive against the current iteration of insurance.  But if you're honest the current iteration of insurance if fucking RETARDED!  Working with insurance companies is a horrendous user experience.  With Tesla you'll be able to hop in the car and confirm your insurance.  It'll track your movement and price you accordingly and fairly.  It's a bigger opportunity than you realize if they get a large enough take rate.  

The solar roof is on the 3rd generation and ramping up quickly. Tesla is on a hiring spree around the country and will be growing the solar business dramatically. This is just the start of the Tesla energy S-curve. With huge solar installation comes WAY more Tesla energy storage grid level systems. Another exponential and disruptive business.
I should try to sell mine. If Bidet did a $3k buyback I’d let him have it.

I have a feeling my Apple 1/29 130c will depreciate tomorrow 😔
So my total profit rn is 1.8k. So ur saying take like half of it. And leave rest shares in? And not buy more right?
It’ll keep going up you might just have to sit on it
One thing to consider is the tax liability on long-term vs short-term gains.

If you can hold out until one-year after you made these purchases, your taxes on any gains will be much lower.

what do people do when they make more money? Pay more taxes, spend more money...

I actually only put in 1,500 on those calls all around. I’m already up 4k.
Right. So after hours is an indication of where it’ll be tomorrow at market open? It closed at 9.11 

In my instance I’m looking at OTM calls, LEAPS I guess   I want to take whatever I can on my way to the expiration date. This basically my first option purchase and I’ve been waiting to find the right entrance and exit strategy

Can I sell GME on TOS after hours if it balloons
Me trying to figure out how big the stimulus needs to be for my TSLA $960 to hit tomorrow 😅
Lol. You read about reddit and decided to dive in. Learn to do your OWN DUE DILIGENCE. Most people are out here to make money. If that means its at your expense, thats fine with them.
If it’s the new GME might need to hop on. Sell my SPCE 🧐
Don't you speak of our mascot like that!!
Better than being an incompetent rapist, stonks.
Gme over 40. Nice
They don’t want us to win
literally nothing about clean energy/EV in the biden plan
Given the current volume i'll say options are a better bet. The premium is till not too high.
ARkG casually hitting ATH during AH lol
GME wow just crushed 40 into 41 AH
When watching years of your salary appear and disappear on a daily (sometimes hourly) basis... giving yourself a cavalier attitude can help preserve your sanity and your ability to think clearly. It helps some people to avoid becoming emotional and making stupid emotional decisions.
I think unless you have the highest level of options, you can only sell cash secured puts. Which means you need the capital to potentially buy 100 shares x (# contracts) @ strike price
GME gapping up 😍😍😍
Fuck yea. Jimmy get the lube cause we goin' in!
GME going supernova

GME BLASTING THROUGH 40 🚀🚀🚀
Lmfao that’s a better position than I have. You’re going to be golden, boy.
you need to sell while momentum is high, the stock is still moving higher just before it reaches the top of the day. When that happens, I can't tell you. 

So sell at higher price while the stock is rapidly going higher, exactly before it slows down. Theres no magic answer, sorry.
Lookin thick. Solid. Tight. Keep us updated bros
That just means you have more time to load up rn
same I can’t find It either
We all got hit this week. Going to be interesting tomorrow who takes profits if we move.
If youre serious about trading read "Trading in the Zone" by Mark Douglas. On my 2nd time now and its changed the way I trade forever. What you just explained will be fixed.
I coulda been you if I wasn’t a retard and blew up my account on Tesla

Woah here we go GME! A little AH tenditown

Great insight. I appreciate your response. Law school and options are certainly different, but they don't have to be mutually exclusive. I'm quite interested in learning about securities law which would go hand in hand with investing.
Hold on you paper handed bitch.
HERE’s hoping stimmy news will give a nice bump across the board.  Maybe more in the most immediately affected markets.  ANNOUNCE A GREEN ENERGY PLAN SO MY GREEN SHARES GO 🚀🚀🚀
I’d be fine with that as I’m holding shares and a Few calls. Just remember that IV is crazy high right now so theta is gonna eat your ass if there’s not a huge downswing. Good luck.
Anyone knows more about the infrastrcture plan? Who are the supposed big winners there? X, MT i assume, but what else?

Damn was short on cash and only got 8 $7c expiring 3/19. Already up but greedily want more and will buy some next payday
Should have bought more APHA instead of this useless fuckin BIOL
Yeah cause you're the only one who's going to sell "once QE eases up" or "fed increases interest rates" and you're definitely going to be one of the first movers to pull out....

This is called timing the market. And you will not beat institutional investors at timing that moment.
damn i’m sad tomorrow’s friday , this week has been pretty exciting lol
I think you mean Sir Jack a Lot - he’s always playing all in recently bought CRSR
proof!
Probably. But only saying that because I have 50x 3/19 8c I sold last week after weeks of slow grind downwards
Last post  is BB gonna moon tmr that’s all I care about
Crazy thing about BB rn is that we have no idea why they are running so hard.
Lmao GME gapping up
$1400 payments going to shove Tesla up to a new level of autistic....

Gme up 4% out of nowhere
GME FINALLY GREEN AH, MOON MISSION TOMMOROW CONFIRMED BOIS 🚀🚀🚀🚀
What are you tards talking about he sold his 20c for 1.5M in cash? He share position is same as yesterday?
I've made a lot of good money along the way, but i'm just saying i've never been in something that the whole sub is backing. I have around $150k, from swinging positions with shares. Gains is gains, but it feels like i'm missing out on the fun lol
My portfolio went up almost 100% as well. I have been looking for reasons not to cash out (see my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kogn47/when_to_cash_out_from_this_craziness/)).

So what I decided is that I'm going to put about half of my money in something long term/low risk like mutual fund or apple. The other half will go into something high risk like Tesla or NIO.
That’s 1% in 2030. Strangely they’re already priced like they’re producing over 50% of all cars today since that’s how much the 10 largest car makers produce together.

That would be a really bad day.
What’s your twitch
Aint too late though, strap on and get it solider!🚀🚀🚀
I've had massive success with buying long calls of $IWM. It is the Russ2K index and is outperforming recently the S&P. Small caps are where it's at especially in the blue wave

S&P - 1Mo - 3.85% / 3Mo - 7.93% / 12 Mo - 18.5%

R2K - 1Mo - 11.36% / 3Mo - 29.83% / 12 Mo - 30%
These are the type of brainless fucks who ramped the short volume over the shares outstanding in the first place.
Hehe, 15 @ 4.79. $500+ profit right now doesn't suck. God I wish I had bought more.
lol, i meant our names. i'm megatron and you're optimus.  make money gang!
He’s the reason I bought GME calls last week lol
Godspeed friend. IV is too high for me so I'm share gang but I hope you get your tendies
Don’t sell GME until Melvin Capital declares bankruptcy
Just saw some of the BB DD looks interesting
All the way in but also wanna know in case it goes tits up
Oh man the bitterness and self loathing for GME paper hands and doubters  is going to be glorious
I'm sad because I wanted to aquire more shares under 20 bucks.
Damn did Biden mention GME, wtf AH
investing and gambling are not the same
i scrolled directly to the bottom for positions. not even there.
Yeah send me your money and I’ll do it for you .
Well for just one payment of $9.99 followed by a monthly payment of $99.99 you can read my ghost written book ‘How the rocket went to the moon’. 

Jokes. Start of easy reading up on all the terminology. Market cap. Float. Cash runway. Beta. 

Then see what areas the main funds are investing in and which stand to benefit from big trends. Check out Biden’s economic plan for example. 

Find a company that isn’t a total joke and that has a product that is either cheaper or better than the competition. Take a small stake and if it starts to move consider investing more.
I’m poor and had one 7$ call I bought last week for 44$ and sold for 264$. I wish I had the diamond hands of u/DeepFuckingValue

You’re a fucking moron if you’re smack talking that gem. Gtfo of here
hopefully there is 🙏🏼
It under value cause the boomer still see it as a phone company, when it actually is a cyber security and OS developer for EV. I see 20 buck easy in the next few weeks then long term 40
never.......buy.......puts
Wtf lmao that wall was a hurdle
also pls explain
Fuck my CC's are gonna get called.
Should’ve went into calls. I respect the play though.
JPow created a monster, we’re in control of this market now 👹😈👺💀🤖
I actually got into both today before reading this. Been wanting to get back in to AMD and start with NVDA but waiting for a decent buy in time, hopefully a nice addition to the more sensible part of my portfolio (i.e. not GME PLTR or a SPAC).
SUN POWERRRRER
Can't wait to be paying 80% taxes each pay check a few years from now with bread at $10 a loaf.
IONI did well today, back to back mega gains. Thanks to the person who did their dd yesterday!
Price target for BB?
Join in the fun, it’s like SPACs but with real stocks. Free tenders
The fact that it's a Friday and the day after a stimulus plan announcement should mean green tomorrow, but I have a weird feeling about being wrong. 

SPX 1/15 3800c
A man of Revolut
Can we trade 1 BB for 1 SPCE
I think GM will sell the Most EV's. 2nd will be Volkswagen. 3rd Tesla.  4th (To be determine from China )

Reason is just GM and Volkswagen (cheaper cars and more variety). 

Tesla probably selling Batteries. Subscription based FSD. Maybe Tesla FSD in all ev's. There are different revenue streams. Tesla Charging stations allowing secondary companies for charging.  Tesla with a StarLink, living in cars pretty soon. mobile home 2.0.

Tesla right now should just buy up all these EV's companies in different sectors. 

Might as up buy up an EV Bus and buy up Ford and create a Model T lmao. Maybe comes antitrust in 10 years lmao. I'll buy up Ford, it's going die anyway. 

Tesla right now is like IBM in the 70's, total domination in almost all aspect of EV technology, but mistakes can happen who knows. 

By 2030, we'll only have 5 major EV companies. Tesla is one them. 

so 2022-2023, Tesla worth more than Apple.
They could have held the olympics last summer if they just had a bubble which they always have anyways.
lol...those are coming in Feb
Fuck youuuu
Felt bad till reading the last bit...
Congrats on the 2hundo!
You owned fitbit stock and didn't know about the alphabet deal?
LOL GME you’re adorable 🥰
GME IS UP 4.5% IN AH
Awomen
What is going on with blackberry after hours
U selling shares tom?
I don’t know but I’ve been holding stocks since early December and it’s my best so far.
GME IS LIT
i have 10k on $90C 02/19 and $95 Jan '22...

been doubling down everyone on all the drops when the fuck is it gna pump
Ahhhhh fuck GME just jumped before I was about to buy more sharss
Each time you dip buy GRWG it goes up. Higher highs and higher lows.
At least that short wasn’t totally worthless
Nobody tell him

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Ahh thanks for bringing this up, idex was a one people were skeptical about with the pump but it is only paying off now.
Good DD I’m in
Not a lot for ICLN in stimmy news I'm afraid, but my Jan 2022 calls are waiting patiently
It seems like a lot of us making Monday today! I see 3 big winners: GME, BB, and Pot stocks.

I’m holding a ton of TLRY calls myself, up a hefty amount today. Which side of the gains are you on?! Any others?!

Let’s gooo 🚀🚀🚀
Clean energy and federal decriminalization are coming.  Tonight Uncle Joe is Stimmy & vaccine.
Y'all should have hopped on the TLRY train. Shit made more sense than GME, got in at $9.
Too much work man it's gotta go
Bought SQ at $25 and SHOP at $100. Still holding.
Brokers and market-makers love this kind of trade because there's not much delta, the spread is wide, and they can charge commission on each leg. I have only once been unable to trade a butterfly as a strategy (ie all three legs at the same time). I wouldn't generally worry about liquidity with something like this.
SPY opens at $380 tomorrow, fite me!!!
Day trading options is way less stressful than holding options. I can easily ride momentum for an hour rather than guess the future.
So we buy nok next
I feel like poking it with stick to see if it’s alive. I’ve been patiently waiting for this stock pump with the catalysts coming up.
Ofc
GTFOH with this shii
This is how i see it. Even if GME falls 20% tomorrow, i still see GME as a 5x investment in a year or so. Just look at their revenue and new management to go e commerce. This is grossly undervalued. I have about 20k worth of shares rn.
Oh so is Twitter next, then? Asking for a friend.
Can't wait for tomorrow. I packed extra snacks because I heard the journey to the edge of the galaxy is quite long🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Bruh it's alright. I kick myself about APHA, GRWG, and RIOT daily.
Sitting on loads of fucking GME 💎🤚🏼
Covered calls are literally cancer

Sold GOEV 19c when the stock was 16/share, the stock gapped up overnight to 20$, where I could have unloaded my bags for a small profit if I wasn't bound by the call. And of course the stock has since retreated back down (expiry tomorrow)

Sold BB 9c expiring tomorrow for fucking lunch money AND THE FUCKING STOCK GAPS UP 50% 

what kind of fucking autism do I have
Odds ARKX has SpaceX at 10% of fund holdings?
Picked up 200 today, 600 more tomorrow, and couple more 15c 2022 leaps.
Goes by Roaring Kitty on YT
$1.9 trillion is meant to “address immediate needs”, apparently a “larger package will follow”.  Jesus fucking Christ how much money are we going to borrow?
The amount of people in this world willing to offer a strongly-presented opinion on something they clearly do not understand—and have not even attempted to understand—is always jarring to me.
Inflation good for stonks.
Who tf is losing money in this market except 🌈🐻
Guess GME took all the fun away from Tesla. Done playing tesla after tomorrow
This is the right answer
Nothing triggers me more then normies coming into options and doing OTM weeklies on meme stocks calling it investing..
I hope high af 🚀
nice, make sure to take profits and use some for taxes lol
Seems like a scam
Think it's still a buy?
3k per firearm? As long as I can go all in on hipoints prior.
Shorts gave up for the evening
There was guy here in the morning pre market saying that BB will have a great day. What a call.
WSB reporting for duty, Cramer
 u/SaveVideo
Everyone has fun until the music stops and you're left standing.

Ultimately dividends is the primary way that companies return profits to their owners, if a company isn't paying dividends, then you have no returns beyond what you'd get from owning any other useless token.
Cramer has updated this post
Rotate into value!
Okay ICLN I see you
Good mentality stick with it
I’m going to keep asking you questions in the future, hope that’s ok
GME up 5% AH
$🌕
Tell them to invest in GME and they’ll have plenty of money for wages
Boom spike up, did a short just get liquidated?
I’m glad I held GME after close
Bidet actually is a rapist though. His staffer Tara Reade #metoo Ed him. He almost had to drop out after video of him molesting kids and her credible accusations shook up the race.
This has been market correction to closer to actual direct value, future value no where close to being priced in.  Moass still on the horizon, possible for sure.  Long term value or squeeze, nothing but upside.
the GME bag is gonna be fucken massive
Those picks are definitely not pure value or dividend stocks.

Apple, Microsoft and Facebook were pure growth stocks 5-10 years ago and can now be considered Quality Businesses with surprisingly high growth. 5-10 years ago these stocks where considered pure risk and didn’t pay out any dividend until more recently.

Anyway I think a mix between different sectors and stock factors is healthy and we shouldn’t be to dogmatic by only picking value, dividends or growth.
Looking like another 30% day for GME tomorrow?
This sounds american as fuck, especially the health care part. To the moon.🚀🚀🚀 I bought BB before earnings and now I have my money back. 🤔
Yes and no on bonds. Yes in that the textbook answer is that you should, both no in that interest rates can't really go lower and bond prices will fall in the future. Perhaps you could diversify another way, like a REIT or dividend sticks.
where bro
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp


A covered call refers to a financial transaction in which the investor selling call options owns an equivalent amount of the underlying security. To execute this an investor holding a long position in an asset then writes (sells) call options on that same asset to generate an income stream.
I would say don’t overtrade. In the beginning I was selling my winners way to early and didn’t have stop losses in place for my losers. My winners were on average +6% and my losers were -10%. In the past 2 months I’ve flipped that to +12% and -4%.
Why tf is PLTR there lol
Already up 600% on my BB 9.5 C 2/12 🚀🚀🚀
They moved to software and have their shit in almost every Chinese EV, Amazon invested too -conference tomorrow so I’m sure something leaked and companies started buying 🚀🚀🚀
Shout out to dude posting about low BYND RSI a few days ago. Gonna grab some Taco Bell before poppin over to peruse the local GameStop
Buyden said "GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
Getting out of WFC, seeing if GDRX rides ESG wave, Buy BB calls, stalk PLTR
You two using Hatch?  Can do premarket trading on Tiger Trade, which opens at 10pm our time, much easier on the sleep schedule
I just complained that it was flat. From my mouth to God’s ears.
Probably just go to YouTube and there will be any number of channels live streaming it- CNBC, PBS News Hour etc.
kek
CAN IT BE TOMORROW ALREADY BOYS🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
GME AH pamping
BB $11 tomorrow?
Can you link it?
Which one of you autists are leaving negative reviews for Melvin Capital on Google?
Tendies are waiting
WSB has ruined my expectations. Made $900 today and felt like a loss.
lol same here.
Idk who needs to hear this but **MORE** GME strikes opening tomorrow 😈🤤😍😏😏😏🚀🚀🚀
This^ just fucking hold and smoke em out. The price aint dropping anytime soon.
He misquoted WSB to say the least... “traders don’t care all about the valuation” is about as wrong as it gets.  I can honestly say that most of the DD’s I see/read on here are ALL about value.- how it’s u set valued, why it’s undervalued, and why it will correct.

This shot should be redacted.  Seriously
That's in a separate plan that'll be announced next month
Its 2 separate bills.  

One for Covid relief

One for Infastructure/Jobs/Climate Change
I hope the PLUG 63P's I sold aren't fuk
Green for errrrbody tomorrow. At least that’s what I hope
Omg this GME shit is just hilarious
GME 🚀🚀
42 GME LETS FUCKING GOOO!!!
30c
Hope so 🚀
It's electric vehicle stock. That industry is on the up and up for the next decade
GME gonna be 50 before tomorrow
More like 600 a week but still. Good lord
Limit order GTC baby
Calling it now, GME to $50 and BABA to $250 tomorrow. Show me the moneyyyy
BB $30 EOM
Lol
AWS
Don't think this stimmy will be about ICLN, but there's still hope
Shorts gave up for the evening or sell wall at 40 broken???
GME, ladies and gentlemen
“The trick is to flick your finger across the screen with your watch list open. Touch the screen when your poop hits the water, and the ticker you touch is your trade for the day. Pro tip: only have TSLA on your watchlist.”
ngl buyden pump only giving me a half chode atm
Hey, fuck you, Tenet was awesome! One of the tightest plotted movies I’ve ever seen, and probably the only “time travel” movie ever with zero plot holes. 

Also the theme song from Travis Scott SLAPS

https://youtu.be/WDSq16hvZ68
and what was the difference to BB? How did u differentiate this and BB?
You try going back to your last checkpoint?
Told you so
I bet they still bootstraps you lol
Just pick your options, enter the price you paid for them. Then in the graph range set it tight so it shows smaller increments like from 9.5 to 11.
GME AH?!?!?
..........
Don't hate buy calls!
GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yep idk who is feeding them this info. I have bundles of ICLN calls too and not thinking it will be mentioned once. Read a fucking Bloomberg article for me one time
Yes. But also no.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO GME WHAT LOL
I swear.
GME soaring
Another $2k??
Check DFV post history one of them he reveals himself as rk pretty much . I think it was about a month ago
I do my trading in my tfsa - sounds like if we were to get audited, worst case scenario is it would be treated like a personal account so nothing to lose.
Thought GME was going to be the same shit as today. Sold 44c to rebuy tomorrow after AM dip to Let me 39 0dtes run free again if volume looks good
Premiums are high, sell contracts
42 already 🥵
100% or nothing. got to make up for Monday close
some autist on here already did something exactly like that and made some shitty amazon book and was shilling it for like a month
Rip to the guy who has the idea to short 😂😂😂
You really think one should sell AMZN, FB, etc that are key holdings in any portfolio just because they are green?
I thought the US trade is closed for today?😅
Just have a 6s 🙈
> “The shorts are freaking out,” said Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities. Meanwhile, “Robinhood message boards are bragging.”

F for 🌈🐻
No. That was Melvins doing about 1-2 months ago
Holy fucking shit, this is literally me calculating how fucked my $40 calls expiring Friday were.
Certified dumbass here but I will try to help.

For an options contract you will need to pay the premium. In this case the BB calls are $113 for ONE contract which controls 100 shares.

TMR if the premium rises to 1.23 from 1.13 (113 to 123) and you sell the contract you will get $123. Either way you lose the premium money. It's a matter of making enough money to cover the premium.
GME AH taking off!!!
Same throwing $3500 at it wish I was a day earlier
Is there any news on GME right now or just more squeezage?
Holding because almost all of my portfolio is on it, I could liquidate ICLN and BABA to buy more BB but holding for now
Why is it going to after hours. Can you please explain this to a fellow noob
May as well milk this market for all it's worth.
He could be Melvin too. He's publicly short but actually long (af) lol
I never said a legacy is or will be better than tesla, werr just talking about the market tesla is in, if my town has one bakery I have 100% market share but that dosent mean I'm worth a billion dollars l, tesla is an awesome company but it is not worth 880 billion dollars it is worth as much as the whole auto industry, I give it no higher than what it is based on math, people predicted dot com with math and facts, and please,please never bring up cathie wood, if you really think tesla will be larger than the jdp of the Japanese economy than fine, but understand that your price target are from someone trying to pump their own holdings saying one company is worth more than all of japan, I mean just think about it.
"And, uh, for my grandson, we're getting, uh, putting lots of money into games. What stores sell games? We'll give them money."
GME gang 🤝 BB gang

🚀
make sure you don't have any open limit sell orders for GME shares either that would take you below 100 shares.
If GME wanted to gap up to $60 tomorrow, I wouldn't be mad
Been watching ABCL but the subborn fucker doesn’t want to drop to ~$30ish so I can buy in
Remind me! 14 days
ARK Funds are mooning AH. The gift that keeps on giving.
gme ah yay
Big size in options.
I think you mean maple syrup Roth IR EHs
Ev self driving tech
one million dollars 🚀🚀🚀
That 50k was a small part of his portfolio. Amazing gains of course but it’s easier to hold if you have 350 other stocks in your portfolio.
Well this certainly ticks all the YOLO boxes. Best of luck to you sir
Reminder, even with the huge gain today BB is very undervalued when you look at their p/e and market cap. And no one has begun to price in their future potential.

Too many boonerdt and wall street guys think of them as a dead phone company. Use their ignorance to your advantage and make $$$$

🚀🚀🚀🚀
Oh we're hitting 55$ don't you worry 🚀
Wow you guys even buying the tiniest of dips... lol
Buyout at $96 let's gooooo
You deserve to be a millionaire.
yep.. the shorts are carrying massive bags lol
What is GME bears r fuk for $50 Alex
Yup on top of the $600 🚀
my $43 calls will print tomorrow
Damn BB retreating already
$YUM
$1.9 trillion is meant to “address immediate needs”, apparently a “larger package will follow”.  Jesus fucking Christ how much money are we going to borrow?
Three is still time, until shorts cover this aint the finish line.
I will wet myself
Exactly, I just don’t know where to project it, it’s undervalued because it transitioned from a dead company into an entirely new market, I think leaps are the way to go because it’s hard to say when the general public will realize that it’s an entirely new company and undervalued
Fuck buying leaps. Have had pltr leaps for ever. Weeklies or lose it all. This is the fuckimg way
i feel attacked
Comment saved. Will do if I remember haha. Thanks!
Should've went further out for more callllllls. Need dem lotto TIX
Thanks. Any idea what time it starts?
I made several hundred off that post lol
yeah, gonna want to pay that quarterly, otherwise tax bill is a few million and that comes with a fuckload of penalties
Biden just announced a 1.8 trillion dollar stimmy with $1400 checks for everyone. We on a moon mission.
Thanks!

> In reality it would have been far more of unrealized gains when you factor in the price of those options at the time.

By this do you just mean that he could have instead invested the $7,260 elsewhere?
That's called luck my dude. You were lucky. Have a little humility.
I bought 20 1/15 40c for $3 per if this shit hits 50 tomorrow I’m 10k richer
GME let’s go bois
Winklevoss twins might take Gemini exchange public
had 3 free months when I got my car, was ok for my first road trip, definitely wouldn't pay for it
Can you explain “it’s a wrap?” As in it will break out and move higher?
Probably an expensive hedge for someone massively short in case they get squeezed some more...
whats the beef with Citi?  been on here for a while now and this is the second time i have seen something about this...
BB on a moon mission
Don't ask if it's worth going in, when BB is under 20$. This is massively undervalued.
Oh, I know the answer to that
Kudos on your success and for planning to teach your niece and nephews about personal finance.  Your guidance can be life-changing for them.  That will be the biggest gift you can give them.
The .5c July calls are .48. Anything above 1$ and you’re free money. It’s guaranteed above 1$ for 30 days. I’m retarded but seemed free $ think  play.
well BB is a real company who makes a profit and has a good outlook so... no I would say if you're in it for the long haul then go for it
GME ABOVE $41.  The rocket is refuelled.  Pluto confirmed.
Hey brosef, back in your cash account, could you day trade everyday with the full balance or was there a delay.  For example, say you had 10k and went all in on the morning. The sold in the afternoon. Would the 10k be available next morning?
To the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀
GME $46.50 open
What you mean XOM blew the shit out of pltr today. At this point pltr just needs to change its name to msft it just sits there.
BB 👑 the thrill is back babyyy
"So glad I invested thousands of dollars in GameStop" is sure as shit a phrase I never though I'd say out loud.
Congratulations. We will watch your career with great interest
At least the castration was successful
40k into 2.7 mils in the second trade alone - most of us have the 40k, but not the balls. Hail to the king of big balls.
Threw a couple grand at a GME 1/15 45c FD for the fuck of it cause I'm tired of missing out on the fun.
I only got 2 at 10am wish I woulda cashed out on these
That’s normal. And it will cost you money to learn what to do :) first you will try to get the max out of your investment, and it will correct some and you will sell because you are scared it will go lower, then it will bounce back lol. It’s the name of the game. Just accept you cannot buy the lowest dip and sell the highest peak. Set goals and if you reach them, be happy.

What I do to make it easier, if I sell a position, I erase the share from my watchlist 😉

Two days ago a sold a position which I bought at 9, and was planning to sell around 14. I sold a 11, because I assume the new position is gonna deliver me a higher return in the same amount t of time then the initial position will go from 11 to 14.
I can be wrong, but I took 20% profit, and that’s ok. I expect a profit in time on the new position.
First thing I did was erase the initial position from my watchlist. I have 20%, I don’t want to know IF I could had more or not. You know why? If I know, it will effect my future decisions based on an emotional factor, which is the stupidest thing you can do in investing. 

Good luck with your investments mate ;)
AH = low volume = easy squeezy lemon retard
GME FUCK IM HARD🚀🚀🚀🚀
Dude, I'm just a retard. I think the real squeeze will start next week.
Can I ask you a couple of questions

1. At what age do you want Financial Freedom

2. What age you want to retire and stop working and live off passive income

3. How much income would you like at age 50 if you retire early
Very nice win!   Had me checking my leaps real quick, haha.  Up 26% today.  Yumyum.
It grows on printers, everyone knows that
GME is up After hours boys I’m gonna bust🚀🚀
soon!
Boring... just buy bb
$2k
fucking legend
All in
they tech now ev software and cyber security
TUFN anyone? Huge move ah
Ashamed to admit I had to google this. I need to watch this movie. Love Paul Rudd and Jason Segel
Got another year until I have to worry about that 😂
holy fuk bb the new gme
Gme shorts are still trying to get out, even now in the ah.
Loaded up on BB 1/22 calls. FOMO'd so much on GME recently let's see how this goes.
Netflix calls through September.
lol GME already 🚀🚀🚀 make me rich
Holding until the real squeeze begins.
After hours is an indication where the stock will be tomorrow but it can also go up or down pre market.  There’s no way to tell, it’s just a gamble.
Bloomberg- “Biden expects to propose a second economic recovery plan in coming weeks, aimed at longer-term job creation and development goals such as climate change”
.
Could this be why ICLN is stalling? No love on this bill?
GME 42$ after hours holy shit tomorrow will be madness
I was told that he was going to receive a blowie behind Wendy's and while passing a Gamestop a freak power outage left only Gamestop lit up, he knew it was a sign from the gods and quickly dumped his $5 into Robinhood.
i would give anything to see him open this email
I'm personally in XLE and it's good if you want exposure to oil companies.  If you want to trade the commodity itself, I was also in OILK for a while this year.
I’m just going to dump it lol. I made 61% on it so it’s kinda sad, but oh well. Steel gang it is!
$SPCE!
same I’m hoping he mentions somthing with climate change 🤦🏽‍♂️
Perhaps im an autist and belong on wsb, but I remain firm in my ~~pants~~ stance
Yeah
Damn we smashed that 40
Hopefully I can get better returns with poker tonight than stonkys
How did this commit get more up vote than my question lol.
GME got jealous of all this BB talk and said WATCH THIS
Any estimates on when the checks would be distributed?
because of the shorted float
the smart guys must be buying up the additional shares that became available to squeeze the shorts tomorrow.

> in at .75c each 
Kill me or pay me damn it
You might enjoy r/thetagang.They're all about selling premium and making money off theta decay. You might be able to do small cash secured puts or buy cheap stocks and sell calls against it as you mentioned, but they talk about other plays too.
🖖
I bet Melvin has been having nightmares
I only bought $9c 1/22 at open this morning when it was OTM because I saw someone's post about $BB here at 2 AM last night.  I hope you have the same luck soon!
Imagine not having BB and GME in your portfolio rn
this shit is so scary im diamond hands with $10k in calls
$BB to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
Lol no I got what you were saying.
How long is this GME pump going to realistically go on for?
Would that apply if I bought a call say, today, at $20 (and exercised), and then sold the call for $21 tomorrow?
Maybe if Biden wasn’t becoming President next week. I think it’ll be green after his speech tonight, but I may be wrong.
I love all you retards.  I listened finally and went all in on GME and BB earlier today 🚀 🚀
went up to my knees in depth but im down to dip my balls in once we make BB the next move 🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀
I think we open above 90
Someone, somewhere out there in the world today, sold their GME before close today. Moment of silence for our severely retarded brethren.
Ahmagh! Eshtebahi kharidi!!! lol
We peaked 42.42 during 4:20 and my phone % was at 69. We gonna fucking MOOOOOON TOMORROW BOYS GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
GME gonna wake up on Mars tomorrow. I can't wait to buy my ~~lambo~~ sensibly priced used japanese car.
Everyone get a payday loan in your $1400 stimmy and pump into GME
Didn't invest enough, clearly!
GANG GANG 🙌💎🚀🚀🚀
GME to the moon! Let's goooo!
A dump for ants :(
Hello happy hulk dicks
Lmao GME keeps going
No, it's $1400
Fffuuuuck always too much of a pussy to go into GME
then my 5x40c calls at 0.03 still print a fuckton
You just despise money if you didn’t buy 1/22 60c GME weeklies at close today
 sony makes some quality shit (headphones, gaming consoles), but honestly their phones are shit... It's like they can't keep up in that department.
I've been trying to get an answer to this in the general discussion thread, but nobody has filled me in.

What is the entity / situation that allows for higher calls?  Is it automatically triggered based on the price rising?
But it's not normal private companies looking to space for profits. SpaceX and Blue Origin are owned and funded by the 2 richest men on earth - #1 and #2. SpaceX do not make a profit - they have a single government contract with 1 government. It's been Musks toy for years now, same as a Bezos with Blue Origin. No doubt these companies are cool and doing groundbreaking stuff, but they aren't and probably won't for 20 years turn a profit. Space companies won't make a profit because there is nothing in space worth anything that is within our reach with current technologies. Only realistic and worthwhile projects are asteroid mining and space debris cleaning, both probably 20 years away. Why would any country want to build a moon or Mars base? Maybe to put a telescope or radiation equipment on it? No one would ever want to live there - moon's gravity is too low and Mars is a radioactive wasteland. 

And all of it at the whim of a single governments budget. Has anyone ever told you that "NASA was a PR company that also went to space"? NASAs budget wasn't cut because of Challenger, it was cut because space, as cool as it is, just isn't worth the money right now.

Yeah, my ass. And the fact that 130% of the float is short.

Oh word. BB got a few things lining up for it. I have some buying power ima prob throw 5k at bb calls for a few months out
It’s not so much a class war as it is a global economy. Low skill workers in 1st world countries now compete against similarly skilled workers around the globe. Similarly high skill workers & business owners are able to leverage their abilities globally and sell to bigger markets.

You want to start a street fight with me bring it on but you will be surprised by how ugly it gets, you don't even know my real name.
Nah, we're all gonna head over to Parler. I hear it's really cool.
Is E*TRADE correct that the total market cap is 107k..?
If I make 25k on one trade and then lose 25k in the next trade is it 22k in taxable gains or is it a wash. Assuming this is all within the same year. Asking for a friend.

That link above will display the yearly cars produced. They have started doing double shifts now (and that's got their monthly production to 7000 a month) with weekly being 1750 a month. So the current capacity would be 84 000 cars per year, with greater efficiency and possibly working longer hours they can gain another 30-40% of production over time. Which will put them at 100k cars per month. Furthermore, I read that this current facility can be expanded and JAC was working on that. I fully expect a new factory to be built (looks like they are doing that) to reach a 300k a year run rate for 2022, and China is notoriously quick at building factories. I think they can reach 125-150k with this factory alone utilizing double shifts, longer hours and a factory expansion. We should hear more about this in the next quarterly report, I don't like to speculate much.

We’re so retarded that it’s empowering
Well numbers don't lie so no matter how you spin it AMD is extremely expensive and the growth is diluted for shareholders by issuing a lot of new shares and selling them on the market.

If you talk about AMDs revenue growth you should also point out how the shares get diluted every year so the year on hear growth does not represent the growth an AMD stock holder sees. 

Intel growth does not get diluted and Intel is much cheaper than AMD. With AMD you pay 130 times revenue AND your holdings get diluted for 5% minimum each year.
AS much as I love the GME memes, this is the best out of all the GME posts.  FOOOOKIN HOLD
Ain't gonna matter check out GME AH 😎🚀🚀🚀🧑‍🚀
same, this is what heaven must feel like
U right
That is BS especially if they have been holding long.     If you have held since the beginning of 2019 you have seen some nutty shit including basically the entire world against Tesla.    Massive amounts of FUD.   No one really getting what was happening  People who held through that have some pretty diamond hands.   The idea that they would sell now after holding through all that because of 25% pullback seems a little out there when they have been through much more severe volatility.    

There were many longs that held through the COVID crash back in March 2020.    That was a fall of of a peak of $177 a share in February to a low of $72 a share by mid march.   What is that almost 60% loss?   So you are saying that people that held long through 2018 (or earlier) and then up to today will sell if there is a 25% pull back.    Well i can tell you that in my case it won't happen.   I will just buy the dip and accumulate shares.    Until the fundamentals change, I hit my price target, or my belief in the company changes I will not sell.     This is true of many many other Tesla investors.  Now are there new people who won't be as long and will be apt to sell?  of course there are.  But I would be very careful here if you think those longs are so easily shaken.

Listen to Toyota's leadership.  They are sooooooo done.  Japan has so many societal issues keeping them in the past.   And we shall see about the FSD licensing.  You may be right.

I would say so. The taco bell news is only hours old. I think we will see more and more restaurants offering vegetarian options as more and more people consider cutting down on meat consumption. I'm not even a vegetarian but I've cut way back on how much meat I eat. I think we're going to see an uptick in vegetarianism in the future.
Same here lol
I’m going to bottle GME shorts tears and sell them on eBay for $1000 an oz.

see you guys on pluto
It actually worked and ironically much better than today in the 50s, 60s.
What does puts have anything to do with it, it doesn’t actually affect the stock price
If you sell at open you will lose money if the price hasn’t changed. I usually don’t doubt my vibe and hope for a rocket ship or put a stop loss at like 50%
I can help.
Also if you were wondering expect Q4 results in March.
Bought in this morning and up big

* NVAX Novavax (Jan - Aug 2020)
* NNOX Nano X Imaging (since Aug 2020)
* JMIA Jumia (since Mar 2020)
So ur saying i should grab calls at open?
I haven't traded at all since last Summer because I was focusing on my license exam, but I passed. What are the best things to get into? Obviously GME but I missed that train. I am thinking calls on AMD, thoughts?
Yup. Not even a single Republican will support this. And I am sure there are still few Democratic Senators who will oppose this.
Good bot
This is why you don’t learn to trade from youtubers. Read a book from an experienced and successful investor like Peter Lynch.

I have the option to buy 6600 shares for the premium of 10k because I have 66 contracts. Most people don't actually take the shares, they just sell the contract at a higher price
As far as the body

My body has been wrecked from manual labor that my shoulders feel like shit anyways. It is one of the reasons I trade. I have my own business and this is a way for me to work two jobs. My business and trading. 

I like the lifestyle when in profit lol I want to experience it more so I can run my business part time and focus more on my health. 

I figure at this point I would rather ache in pain with a strong back and shoulders then keep living in pain and getting weaker as I continue to work in my business. 

Plus I have a few friends that have been in prison and what you can tear working out goes out the window when you have nothing but time. 

That’s how trading feels like you have nothing but time. When in fact the more time you trade the brain gets tired and wears out. Working out is
Helping me deal with the time management. 

Passive effect is getting more fitter and stronger. 

If you can do push ups then perhaps just push your self with something intense you can handle and work towards push-ups and sit ups etc. 

But the point is it has to be though, even if it will tear a muscle. 

What ever it takes to stop entering the market and giving the market your money.

Last I have made good profits. I’m tired of giving it back. I usually find that I make profits my first few trades. Then at some point I lose. Then I make 2-3 losses right after. Respecting this work out should prevent that. As well as give me time to move profits around and re evaluate my self. Before wrecking!!?
I expect a ton of people on this sub to sell at 100 if it hits that.  I will have a hard time holding myself as this is my first big play. That being said, it has been nothing short of a fucking pleasure gentlemen. u/deepfuckingvalue you're a King among peasants.

Most of you guys act like he was investing and fucked up because he didn't just long SPY @ the dip. He's clearly trying to learn, I imagine trying to learn reading a chart, plotting support and resistance, drawing trend lines, learning how to find and understand FA, and then executing a trade. Yeah most you guys just bought some shit and never looked at a chart and it made you more money than him, but hes trying to learn, not gamble. "I threw a dart at some stocks and don't even know what support or resistance lines are, I made 10k this month!" good job, you're gambling. The fact that this went over the head of almost all of you here baffles me. He's learning to trade stocks, hes not investing.

Idk why anyone would expect the stimulus bill to address clean energy. That’s an entirely different conversation
Burry has been long on CVS so he probably knows something too, maybe just extremely oversold?
Mmm, this is what tends to happen

1. You make stuff you think is nice and it’s well made and you put a lot of effort in 

2. You set up a booth at a market

3. No one buys anything and you sit there for 3 hours

4. People come up and finger your goods while clutching a hamburger and then walk away without saying anything 

5. Someone asks if you can sell a piece for half price and gets upset when you say no 

6. One person comes to talk to you about your craft but all they are interested in is telling you about the what they do and how interesting it is and did they mention the 43 pieces they made last week and then describes each piece in detail. 

7. Then it starts to rain

Yes. Am currently cash and will prob stay this way until i got refuel some on RH. I use TDA now and the margin rates are awful. 

As long as you are trading options it settles the next morning. Stonks take 2 days to settle.
I used Zillow to sell an investment property. Sold it pretty fast. I just listed it for free there and no where else.
Lumen was not a merger. Centurylink changed their name. I think it's a real solid play. I also feel like they make a good acquisition for like a TMUS (another solid play - but the dip) who uses them for their wireless network backhaul. Maybe the name change was part of packaging all the entities they own to sell, even though they haven't integrated their assets well.
Michael Burry was also referencing purchasing BB since February of 2020 IIRC. Back when it was sub $8. 

I can’t believe it took WSB basically a year to jump on it. Like I’m happy you all finally got on board but holy fuck you all missed out some some cash.

I'd recommend yall to BUY HCLN tomorrow it released today at $20, its basically Canada's version of ICLN but Trudeau is actually pushing clean energy hard as fuck unlike Biden who won't even mention it anymore
I think you have to apply for it just google how to trade AH on ToS
Listen, I know what sub I’m in. Just curious if you pinned it on anything in particular. The float is a GREAT sign

I read a post about a month ago telling me to buy. I did. I held it through a brutal earnings report. I held it through 28% losses. My friends laughed at me, my family laughed at me. Who’s laughing now?

Good question.  I have spent so many years "in the routine" that I can't even sleep in on weekends/holidays.  up at 5:30 and ready to go.

I would probably take several months just to decompress and let it become "real".  I suspect that I will eventually find some kind of low stress job just to stay busy; but I no longer want the stress of managing large groups of employees, projects, deadlines....

I will ponder this.  Thank you

If it all works out about $2132 gain with $6500 in collateral. Basically would make up for the FDX losses the past few weeks
HAHAHA
This threesome I’m having with GME and BB is hurting my cock
I think sell the news movement into gap fill down to 54 by next week
I don't believe your premise is correct. For the life of me I can't understand how I'd replicate an AAPL Feb 130c with AAPL shares and a loan. Even if you trade actively to keep the delta right, how do you account for time value?
GME we just gettin fkin started
Made money as a Bull so I bought TSLA puts
10/10 reccommend. Males cutting losers so much easier, and scaling out to take profit
A day trade is a round trip on the same contract on the same day.
Sold calls against my shares this morning. Looks like I'm losing those shares! Lol.
GME AFTERMARKET 🚀
Guys so does mean the $40 sell wall has been penetrated
I don't need food lol i can survive on ramen, that shit's going straight into PLTR March calls.
 Pass, there will Always be another opportunity. Liquidity sucks a/h too
Holy shit holy shit I didn’t think my GME calls were gonna print tomorrow what the fuck 69.420 here we come 🥜
BB TLRY PLTR and CCL calls locked and loaded
50 by open even a blind ding bat could have seen it
Go to WSB and search BB you will see a couple of posts with the DD flair
420.69
That thread makes me so fucking happy, watching his streams for a while now too he just seems like such a genuine, deserving guy.  Did his fucking homework and he's set for life
I didn’t know there were types of investors other than money hungry ones - does anyone do this just for the losses?
yeah, those rockets seem hella confusing
He is extremely excited about this. We’ve been running family businesses for 3 generations now and he thinks it’s funny that millionaires and billion dollar hedge funds could get bent over due to a gaming company stock! He took money out of his 401k to join in. 😂
Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour is in this bill? jeez that's bold, not that I'm against raising the minimum wage, but unless that gets toned down to something more like "when this bill passes, we will start to slowly raise the federal minimum wage", I would guess this isn't getting done.

Adjust that and I think this goes through though, a lot of what we saw for the past few years was bills just not even getting to the floor.
Lold thanks
He does have a point...
Half of y’all “ohhh my gooooodness what is happening with GME it’s going up I can’t believe it!!!!!”


Where in the fuck have y’all been.
No
> GME is grossly overvalued.



I think you mean undervalued? Lol
BABA please don't leave the station. I have to wait until Jan 23 to buy BABA. That's what I signed up for when decided to harvest loss for tax
Go to WSB and search BB you will see a couple of posts with the DD flair
4, 9$ 3/19 calls here pulse 100 shares. Creamer will bitch about it tomorrow into next week stock starts to fly up there automation system they have for vehicles is really impressive.
Most important question: did you sell or exercise your 1/15 calls?
i wanna jerk off while melvin bleeds to death. am i a psycho? maybe but it feels awesome
My ass
Looks like these GME 1/15 45c are gonna print after all!
I was probably in the negative at 20 trying to pay my way through college. Lucky bastards.
I’ve been in a coma for a few months...how are my MSFT and BABA calls doing?
Damn. Dude, you have decoded the Matrix. 14,000% returns! Insane.
Please share your knowledge. 
💎🤚💎🤚💎🤚💎🤚
When the short interest of a stock is 150 percent of it's float, it's going to take a minute to unwind it. lol
Yup 1/15, hoping tomorrow is a thetagang day and plug stays flat. Wouldn't mind owning it at 63 for a few days tho
Solar stocks gonna take a hit from this hit piece Buzzfeed just dropped:

THIS IS FUCKING POD RACING
I know and thats something they need to work out but don't count them out yet, and btw I would never touch Toyota because management has their heads so far up their asses but that dosent mean i would touch tesla either.
I say 60+
I sold at 32.5 and bought back in at 35.6.
Shares
I did. Do it! We goin’ GME style tomorrow.
Fixed. Sorryboutdat
>they fabricated sales(20%) and the stock tanked down to 4-5 that morning, I grabbed a few thousand shared 

You truly belong here.
My liege, what is your battle forecast for tomorrow?
Not me 👎
Bears wont sleep tonight
tomorrow we will ALL be BB users...on the moon
Have you been stuck under a rock all week? GL with your puts
That’s only based on one person though, I’m going to have to look into it more
When did you make these calls?
guys i want to do a big short and be autistic for 2 years waiting for it to pay off like burry. any recos? i'm thinking pork products
Talking after close
Congratafuckinlations 🚀🚀🚀🚀
300 @ 33sir
Oh well
is it? we had a good day today but didn't react at all to biden's speech
Thats gonna print
I bought 100 gme 40 calls when it was at 37 today for 2.06 right before it went to 43.  Should of held longer but scaled out on the ride up.
Can someone start a gofundme so WSB can collectively do this en masse?
Howmuch profit you made on options?
GME FUCKING FALL PLEASE
Upvote because my golf swing is bad
GME and BB tendies tomorrow 🤩🤩🤩
I bought 1/22 $50 calls. I’m in. I know IV blah blah but hey, if this thing takes off IV doesn’t matter. 

I’ll buy 500 shares if this dips, but hopefully I don’t have to.
They underestimate our retard strength
I’ll buy tomorrow & whatever it is at open lmao. This baby only going up from here.
My God GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Nice!  In some communities, the community/rec center will offer a variety of classes, including computer/application literacy.  Where I live, pretty active (well, in normal times), and the instructors can collect a nominal fee.  Would be a good way to stay engaged, contribute, and earn a bit of pocket money.
Could you possibly be so fucking retarded you don’t think insider trading is rampant on Wall Street? There is no fucking way in hell they aren’t trading insider knowledge constantly. It’s so insanely hard to prove it in court - how the fuck do you convict someone (without a recording obviously) for a crime that consists of speaking one or two sentences? 

Someone already said it better than I - “if you ain’t cheatin you ain’t tryin”

No way in hell is that not the mantra for these massive financial firms.
I’m up like 1500% in half a year on a stock that most people in this sub was saying is a retard investment 

GME GANG WYA WE THE KINGS NOW
Another tip of the hat to those Jan 15 calls you unloaded
we are not a fucking blog!
Everything is blasting AH. Stimmy was necessary.
**In 2 days, GME went to the moon, built a base, refueled, stopped by Pluto for a break, and is now en route to Alpha Centauri**
ride the blue wave and also  become one of Cathie's children.

Also, congrats.
Csiq p/e ratio like 15

Fslr p/e ratio  like 50

Sunrun p/e ratio 2831 and does 4 times less revenue than the above per quarter
💎✋🏻
Your friend is wrong. 

Don’t focus on share price, that doesn’t mean much.
THIS ROCKET IS FUCKING HUGE 🚀🚀🚀🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚀🚀🚀🚀
doing that is retarded in the worst way.
ya gme just started lmao

Lmao seriously GME is getting to $50 tomorrow and $80 next week
Then you'll be left holding lot of worthless stock if you're not careful.
won't make you nearly as much as the GME calls will be
Or course you can just cash out 100k
I have that call but I’m too stupid to check what it’s worth after hours
I bought 21 $22.50 Calls for March 19th last week while FCAU was at 18.50.  I got a message last night that there was a corporate action and my FCAU calls are now FCAU1, and FCAU's price dropped by $2.00.  It sounds like now I still have to meet the same strike otherwise it will expire worthless, but if it does meet the strike I get an additional 184euros/contract if I exercise them?  The stock price said it was up 3% today, but it's $2 below what it was yesterday.  I'm confused.....
I got a Webull  account for their special offer on free stocks and will be honest with you it is way wacky to navigate their site and I thought Fidelity was complicated
We wake up in a sea of tendies tomorrow god damn it
These daily threads.

Woof.
fuck it of course i’ll throw a a little money at BB, feels good
1. For a same maturity you don't have different bonds, each bond has a slightly different maturity. Use as your benchmarks the most liquid points: on the run bonds and futures. 
2. Indeed that's why people interpolate in-between bonds to build artificial rates for points like 2y; 5y, 10y, 20y, 30y etc...
3. Futures roll, they never reach maturity.
Bro, I don't even know what I'm doing.
I never thought I'd be buying fucking BB anything in 2021 but here I am doing exactly that.
False
Shit, why?
well lets say you sell a call at 45 when its at 40. The stock goes to 45 so you buy it to cover, later, itll get exercised at 50, but you lost no money, you just had your money held up for a few moments is all. You still make money from the contract iself, there's no risk except the risk of you losing money because the stock goes back below the 45 point at which you purchased it.
Go to WSB and search BB you will see a couple of posts with the DD flair and there is some pretty compelling evidence of future growth
At this point Biden might as well give the 2k stimmy in GME shares
65 eod?
$1400 works too! Still on a moon mission 🚀🚀🚀
They're just mad because we're winning the game.
Primo goods
A glitch in the matrix maybe, that shit is mooning
Does anyone know anything about the AMD acquisition of XLNX
I just three 3k at GME in after hours. I hate GameStop and don’t have the faith y’all have, but maybe this will be the smallest rocket boost to help y’all reach the moon.
idk im skittish on any wsb meme stock. 

usually i pick em up before the meme pump
# $CCIC where the next money bag at!!
I agree
This is the way.  Sleep like a baby every night.
Jesus christ you are truly a fucking idiot. Are you rich op?
I know everyone gonna say triple digits, but I’ll trim around $50. I’m sorry, gang. I gotta eat.
Reminder we in the greatest bullmarket ever sooo buy bu buyy buyydennn
It always does
They could raise it to $3k and people would still buy it. Also the service providers always finess the plan so it's not as expensive anyway (Galaxy S20 5G cost: $800, I paid $350)
Puts expire tomorrow so just need it to hold up for a day
.... What's the original movie?
Teach me senpai
I'm still trying to understand how calls work, can you give an example of what you mean and explain a bit? Thanks!
Same 10 1/22C $15
I'm definitely feeling less worried about the possibility of a solid dip by the minute 😅
you can still sell them tomorrow right?
715
GME should announce an offering lol

Just buy dude
O
Ya green energy calls are fucked.
literally everyone
I’m going to fucking tendieland or breaking even don’t try me🚀
Investors are taking a closer look now and realizing it's no longer a boomer phone company
Strange, I had the same gut feeling as well, but decided the fomo is worse than a little bit of dip so kept my shares. 

Also not a 🌈🐻
How will you sell the same call option that you already exercised?
I jumped on and I’m GLAD I DID. PLUTO HERE WE COME! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
i know it will never happen, but maybe elon can make the model 2 rumor official tomorrow for my calls?
Yikes. It’s leaving tom PM
**GME IS GOING INTERSTELLAR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**
START THE PRINTING MACHINES
Its not a buy and hold forever stock.  Look at the long term oil charts. 

Its a good trade.  Then out
i think im gonna start with divs since i wanna get those as young as i can but when i get more profits ill definitely put it into ETFS and maybe some growth stocks focusing on tech and clean energy
Could Wall St shorts be covering chunks of GME PM/AH to try limit a VW type squeeze?
Cheap labor? Bullish af
I bought more cryptocurrency when it tanked the other day, the opposite of panic selling.   I knew the risk of trying to catch the knife when it falls. Made all my losses back by having balls of steel.   Maybe hanging out with the WSB autists isn't always a bad thing.  I will do the same if the market fails.  Double down at the bottom.

I am poor and bought 4x VALE 1/15 17C for 0.09 back in september. I sold them thee weeks ago for a 2.5x bagger. They were 20x next week lol fuck me
All in PLTR
Still holding over here. Wish me luck. 😬
I spot a bear. Where’s my shotgun
bb 10 bagger here we come :) holding 10 8c @ 0.2
not before u take 1 last pic with the doggie filter
Best part is that options are insanely cheap.  The leverage is amazing. 

Small movements = Big Profits
As a follow up, what did you retire TO, if you don't mind my asking?
Smart dropping those tomorrow expiring calls before the epic shitstorm of dealer unwind that is coming tomorrow. Master trader.
Don’t fuck up and buy AirBnB instead of BB, I gots puts 🌈🐻
Hands up if you lowkey jamming with this 🙋🏻‍♂️
It's $2000 total 🤑
after hours is going full retard!!
I feel the same. Up 600 odd percent and not selling. Sometimes I question myself "what the fuck am I doing?" Then I buy more shares.
Yeah
Tsla stock too high
Your wife’s bf must be happy
BIDEN IS SENDING THE STIMMY...
TLRY🚀🚀🚀🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🚀🚀
GME just keeps on giving and giving. I'm PDT banned on eTrade, Robinhood, Tradestation and Tdameritrade. What's next
Fuk u gay ber, let the fomo consume you
Lmao my bad hahaha yes undervalued
As far as I’m concerned this is the biggest news event of the last 2 weeks...

It’s like this guy just walked into the vault while the bankers just sat and watched while he walked away with all of their money. Think about it, excluding those who inherit money, the small population of people who have $7mm+ in liquidity have dedicated their lives to outperforming their peers in their particular field of work. Meanwhile, this fucking guy just yolo’s into a decaying retail stock and magically goes from a typical broke redditor to a god damn yuppie. It’s like the guy in band of brothers who just calmly walks through the battle line during the battle of the bulge in the middle of enemy fire and comes back with the goods, like nothing even happened. Feels like this just shouldn’t happen in real life lol.
Sorry, I meant a $10M offering
Given your response, I highly recommend you learn about options in a more structured way by reading investopedia or watching YouTube videos. Picking up bits and pieces of information here without understanding basic fundamentals is not gonna help.
🤡🤡
What about TSM? I bought the top and now it hurts right here 𓂸
Cohen kool aid manned that wall and buried Melvins bitch ass in the rubble
I’m pretty long on shares, got in at 17 bucks or so. This shit trades at like 6-7x EBITDA if you just look at the telesat financials. Not to mention that doesn’t give any credit for LEO 5G deployment. 

http://www.circleid.com/posts/20201229-telesat-proposal-for-larger-constellation-canadian-darpa-contracts/

Looks like they’re doubling their constellation size so sounds pretty bullish, and also recently closed a 600M agreement with the Canadian government. Here’s hoping it gets picked up in ARKX!!
Yeah I'm okay with April/May calls, I stopped yoloing weeklies, it hurts my butt
I'm losing faith here cause I'm seeing downgrades and shit. Just because INTC changed their fucking CEO somehow means AMD should go down? Fuuuuuck that
why? isnt it a good thing
ah, ok. never used robinhood. just my schwab
The way I look at it is all the P&Ds have left the stock. So it's a steady healthy growth from now on.
Looking at Blackberrys financials and simply can't find a reason to have a long bias other than meme status
He said he’s using margins.
$MT Gang
With that amount of money.   I'd enjoy it 🤷‍♂️
Yeah I have found when I hold shit overnight it just fucks me up the next day.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I can't even be part of the gang cause i dont have 500 bucks to invest as minimum for any broker (not a us resident)
Ok ok thanks, I just wanted some insight since I’ve been seeing hold on these gme posts didn’t know if to hold all the way through until it expires or they meant hold stocks or simply both.
I went all in at close!!! Yes brother!!!
Still learning a lot about strategies but how did you profit from the 1/15 40c if it’s substantially OTM?

I have been riding 4/16 23c since November and I’m up like 450% with ample room left
I just gave in and bought yesterday at close, I’m sitting up on a 25% cushion today, so I doubled down, because it can’t go tits up!
Everyone and their moms buying GME now. GAMESTOP IS BACK Y’ALL
You've made two attempts and despite your condescending attitude, still haven't actually answered the question. Would you like to try again?
Nah
TLRY
This guy Jelly ^
It soared past 40. Sitting at 41 in after hours
Jensen huang wants in too
Lol I just gave someone the advice in the first paragraph almost exactly. I find it's best to set limits and stops for almost everything so I don't even try to second guess myself. I agree it's useless to try to maximize gains, that is where people mess up.
ATH
Sell? What's that? Give Cohen some time. Any news will be positive and this stock will just keep trending up.
Automatic exercise unless the holder tells their broker not to exercise their contracts
Pretty sure all you guys at Wendy’s get a raise, I should get one too.
i dont know what to do with my jealousy, watching all of you retards get rich off of early 2000s stocks (looking at you GME and BB)
Are we over BBBY already?

I was wondering this as well. Did you manage to find an answer?
Well done brother!!

I find it much easier to just grab something, hold for a day or two, and resell. I've day traded a couple things, but it seems like most stocks rise a day or two, then take a small drop.

Positions: 70% above $9 in next year but I’m sure we can get a better price
Jesus Christ take some profits
I sold 1/22 36c at open this morning +25% because I was going skiing and didn't want to fuck with it all day. It was up double at close 🤷‍♂️
SPCE gonna moon (literally) thanks to queen Cathy and science focused Dems led by BuyDen 🚀🚀🚀🚀🍆💦🥴
Already 7x on this at $28 cost basis so I ain’t mad.

Holy shit this AH action is nuts.  

2/12 10.50c are going to PRINT GOLD for me tomorrow morning
I’ll take it 🤤🙌🚀
Cramer is now the smartest boomer expert, I wouldn’t doubt that he starts catching on to trends early now, he’s fully embraced WSB and has started to understand that getting in early is the most important part of modern investing
It's not that it does. It is that it can. You just gave a reason why.

In essence it is not a black and white world; to say, "Oh no, that wouldn't!" is mostly theory. It's cute. At best.
Hopefully everyone in WSB
Thats me actually up 250 k in my paperaccount fack
I have a large position in GME at $23 average. I am concerned about the huge number of expiring contracts and the effect it will have on SP and whatever the hell the short squeeze concept says.
Get fucked
Today I added 4k shares , to a total of 6k, i'm with you on the spaceship
Fuck it rebought GME after paper handing yesterday. Shorts went up massively over 70 000 000 today. This isn’t going bankrupt it’s going up up and away. I don’t care if I’m risking what I’ve made on it
Not yet. Not yet.
Possibly but It will increase involuntary unemployment
Still got Tastyworks, Webull and others to go!
55c gonna print

My school had to team with Chegg last semester for investing massive cheating on their platform.
this is the way
It’s not a tech stock. VALE has been up crazy today and MT is moving as well. I’m holding April calls and they’ve been moving up all day. VALE still moving AH.
They are hilarious
That’s not what I meant - I’m bullish equity long term but want to add a hedge and TSLA’s 800% run makes it a good hedge play as opposed to QQQ or SPY puts! Tell me more please
Sold my first CSP on PLTR today. Rise up!!
Stock is low enough to be pumped as in robinhood autists can afford it
GME isn't even at its fair market value. 6b in revenue, 500m in cash, and current valued at 2.78b market value.  Price/sales is at .50, we'll see roller coaster action. Maybe some deep dips, but at this point. All the media attention means GME GOING OUT OF THE GALAXY 🚀🚀🚀🚀
It wasn’t much but I sold 10 minutes before the squeeze to throw on Tesla. Fml
The volume ain’t there yet but it just might be 45 by open tomorrow
2 @ 11 and sold them yesterday. Just getting into trading

I realized pretty quickly that Robinhood wasn't an investing app, it was a video poker machine in my pocket.

This is insane
5% isn't a huge increase, but it never hurts to look around. Now there are a few online agent/brokers that will do most of the leg work for you. I used policygenius last month and it went well. They sent all offers about 2 days later and my premium decreased 60%. I've heard good things about gabi too.

Most genomics companies are going to fail or never go up beyond random intraweek pump n dumps. It's the one sector where I'd always want to go with an ETF (I only know of ARKG and PBE), since there's almost no one to know in advance which company will win big in genomics.
CAD and USD mix up on your part ?
if dive tomorrow, load up!
So uhh.. when’s Biden making that announcement?
Those bb about print tomorrow
oh SHIT GME BE MOOOOOOONING AH!!!!! oh shit
Can someone tag me the link that shows the whole conversation of the guy who made all the calls for GME and everyone was shit talking? I can’t find it.
If you think corporations or big league investors care about slave labor then you’re gonna be disappointed...
RUN been printing all fucking year!
Yahoo Finance just had CRM up 6% after hours and I almost shit myself
Buy leaps
Mods here are actually good, wtf
I’m at my personal risk tolerance
Holy shit if this holds overnight I’m rich
BB is ZomB company
Shut up Melvin
Agree. I think that ethically minded investing gets overlooked by all the bros looking for quick bucks but for things like this that our planet literally depends on I have no issue going in on (As long as the company fundamentals are sound)
GameStop is literally the greatest company in the world I’m so glad you guys didn’t give me more for my trade ins back in the day
yeah folks were pumping BB a few months ago, no idea it would actually moon
1 month later: Loss Porn, from 20k to 34k to 1k
Don’t give up, keep going....  it took me 3 yrs to find a strategy that works for me.

Since March I’m up 30k
yeah, safe to say these mother fuckers printed
You don't say
How could you have possiblly timed it so well? I don't understand
OH MY GOD GME
100?
I thought this sub was retarded for the GME memes but holy crap. I really hope that you are all successful with BB
I agree with you and I also think one of the main issues is getting high speed internet into the hands of people, but with how tech and innovation are moving its becoming more clear that its in everyones interest that people get access to high speed internet(except ofcourse these shit ISPs and their shills), and its a question of time before it happens. It has years to go before its viable and thats why im still sticking to GME, I dont doubt that Ryan will put GME on top for many years. I just dont view GME as a very long term play
Got a PT?
Hell naw son, the shorts finally are running out of gas ⛽
Tilray printing
I'm in both.
Is my 55 1/15 gme call goood boyz how we feelin I know my ass is shaking rn

don’t insult me like that
Needs more Rockets
Are there even any bears left here to test it out on? I think they all died.
Yes and then you deposit 200k and withdraw 400k
GME IS AT 42!!!!!!
Kinda new to options. Bought 1/15 10.5$ #20 for super low. Hopefully it pays off big. If not, I'm a retard anyway
I feel like my $50.00 limit sells on GME are too low lol, brb.
It got fucking gaped
Man I just signed up for a Wealthsimple account but my funds arnt gonna be in till Tuesday...don’t take off without me guys😢👋🏻🚀
Oh shit, it’s taking off in after hours! LETA GOOOO 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
1/15 GME $50 FDs about to print 💦💦👅👅
Was just doing some light browsing on my alt porn account and wsb was a recommended sub
GME. You better stay up there. Don’t you dare come down again
GME gon be +40% pre market and then it gon dick up to 1000000000%
DO NOT LET YOUR CALL EXPIRE AT 3:59PM. You are new. Sell before 3:30pm to be safe. I think robinhood autosells for you at 2pm because robinhood is for homos.
Mortgage rates at a 2 month high and still going up. RIP housing market
What time tomorrow?

Lol Biden won’t mention it. Don’t be a foolio

I’m in on hcln though
No
So if THE KING were to exercise his open calls tomorrow could he singlehandedly force the squeeze?
Who we fuckin
Shit feeling bad I sold my most of 36C expiring tomorrow . Well atleast left 15% of them on the table . Guess profit is profit 😀
JESUS FUCK WE MIGHT OPEN AT 50
Don't complain. The only way to save the planet from global warming and racism is to pay 80% tax! You're... Not....one of those racists are you....?
Common knowledge
He also called the GME short squeeze
borrowing against ourselves no big
That's why ICLN dropped today. Insiders were selling.
Bot told me that he removed my comment because it mentioned the forbidden coins that rhyme with bipto-durrency. Those things will drive the need for graphics cards, and given that bipto durrency is booming right now, we'll probably see a surprise on the earnings report
What was the expiry on those?
Nope but am perfectly ok with the play I made 400k on XL already...
I remember being worried that I missed the boat when I put $40k into GME 2/19 calls at $34.25 this morning. 

Then I remember feeling like I was “making a sacrifice for the greater good” when I bought 1000 shares at $36.20. 

Guys, even though GME is up huge, **it’s not too late to get on the train**. 

GET IN!!!
This needs a real answer. I've commented about this a few times in the last 48 hours and nobody can provide a sound explanation to how this directly increases stock price. 

It's pleasing to know that Melvin Capital's 50k+ puts are expiring worthless, but what makes people think this will rocket GME's price?
lol GME
Did you do the DCF yourself? If so why did you choose 30% annual revenue growth (seems completely fallacious based on historical growth) and how is this possibly a conservative valuation to also apply 35x terminal value EBITDA multiple?

Trying to do my DD here before I enter any long position
I came back to the PC and looked and was like WAT?!
Biden's plan got posted and very little on green energy. RIP ICLN gang
Hi Cramer
He’s not taking the chance but IV is so damn high that it’s worth it versus the delta + at this point.
Follow trends.  Identify key levels. Today buying gme on the break out of 38 was an easy options trade.
If people here didn’t understand how the market works, then how did we win at their own game? This makes no sense!
Power to the playas
GME!!! LETS GO AFTERHOURS BROS
THESE ROCKETS ARE FUCKING HUGE 

🚨🚨GME & BB ARE GOING TO JUPITER 🚨🚨

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀HOLD ON BOYS
nah elon has greater autism powers and will prevail
Sold GME 1/15 39c contracts today and opened 2/19 45c... lol I somehow might have played it too safe
The answer is yes.
Ok
I’m about to buy a shit ton of GameStop products to pay them back for retirement
Upset at myself for missing the boat on gme 😭 🥺

Prob should've rolled them out to Feb but my ass is still sore from holding for so long
Soaring after hours
Potentially expiration can be in your favor if people choose to exercise the contracts to shares
this is the way
Oh nice. Thanks for this
Everyone will know when we’ve peaked
So glad I took some of my losers from TSLA and put it all in GME

We opening up at 50 boys 🚀🚀🚀
Just went back and read your last DD too. I’m in boiiii, on that 30c 2/19. 🚀🚀🚀
GME up 6.5% AFH. Nice.
WHAT DID WE SAY, GME JUST STARTING
Undervalued because the boomers don't like it. Massive upside from new direction that hasn't been priced in yet. Fuck outta here with that. 🌈🐻 gonna get 🍆💦
No choice for BB. We gotta outrun inflation
Ya know, this whole 'making bank after hours' thing doesn't suck.
Yes
I hope so, enough of these 🌈🐻 out there don’t need them to procreate
Nobody tell him
Definitely belong here. Yes its free money.
R/wallstreetbets it’s an interesting place worth a couple laughs at the very least
GME and BB leaps for free tendies
Looking at after hours like goddamn GME you don't stop 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Fuck yes!!
GME DONT FUCKING STOP ILL BE HOME IN THE MORNING
GME AH got me rock hard. Three inches
10 year is getting alarmingly high
If I’m a small pp Amazon shareholder and I see BB mooning, why wouldn’t I sell a share for 300 fucking BB shares??
SIG
On mobile, resolution impossible to see the details.  Put call ratio?
Yup I'm in till at least 10-20B. Virtual reality gaming, streaming etc has so much potential and Cohen knows how to get the job done.
Thanks man!

Yea it sucks seeing it and being like “well that would have been a free loaded Y had I waited a couple of months. 

I was selling to wait for a $50 dip to rebuy really.. so to save $500 potential I sold it all
Can we please create a separate GME thread
I agree, not getting all these super short term way otm plays. It's almost impossible to lose money with gme this week, yet nature finds a way, I guess.
I will be excersing my expiring calls. The first time I've ever done that.
Up 10% already!
Fidelity has Robin Hood beat on fractional shares hands-down
lol its thursday
Fun fact: If you bought $1000 of HOME 1/15 calls 2 weeks ago they would be worth $77000 right now.
I too struggle with being a paperhanded bitch.

Basically though, when you find yourself wanting to sell, stop and reevaluate. Is the thesis that made you buy in still true? And if you were 100% cash, would you buy into it right now? If so, then don't sell.
PLTR
Recommend buying more dnn now? Looking at .79
Use a different exchange that allows it
$1.80USD

Which makes sense if it was $2.40

But it says my cost was $3.13 CAD which it never had hit that price
I told my wife what we did to GME & now BB. She says why haven't y'all been doing that from the beginning 🤣🤣🤣
Because we said so
Buy HCLN instead of ICLN, Biden don't care about Green energy anymore, Trudeau gonna pump HCLN so hard trust me
You got me on that one 🤷‍♂️
That makes no sense but sure.
Gme and bb! Cmon boys, lets go!!!!
Forgot about this one! Nice!! I love SPCE, wish I had some, but I’m all in TSLA and TLRY lol
Tomorrow.  Always the closest expiration.
ARKG AH 💦💦💦💦
This is the way.
Definitely too low, dream of triple digits my man
Steel gang:  how we feeling?

It's the circle of life

Too low IMO
6:15 PM central time
Its literally up to $42 AH.
The fuck you got covered up down there, bud?

Got something juicy or retarded?
Bought shares and some 1/22 45C at 37 eod. Let's get 45 tonight boys.
Rip to my X call lol
THE SHORT SQUEEZE: HOW A COMMUNITY OF UGLY DEGENERATES REVIVED GAMESTOP

coming out 2022 summer
Bought some! Playing weekly’s with this because of the 6 days they have to finish the squeeze. Also the premium on a 55c next week out is like $3(prob more now) which is just absolutely bonkers.
Shit heads probably haven’t ever used Reddit.
ill have to look into this then! Just thought that the cut from 50k would be like 10-20k for a good one but ive never looked into it i just assumed it was only for the super rich
Let’s go GME get it
I wish i had options. I only got 74 shares. Darnnit
This means housing will get cheaper though. Also Calls on RKT for refinancing ez pz
It seems that these don't hold if the moves are after/ pre market hours, is this the case w your broker?
Alright boys now that we have gotten GME to a 5 year high, whos playing the way back down? Once this thing slows down of course.
GM going to have a corvette SUV, fuck yea
Go GME Go
This is where time slow downs almost to a halt
I had no idea. I can scalp but only traded stocks because spreads were so bad. This changes things.
Whats that got to do w bb
GME $80 EOW
>outsmarted

Bad word choice, there's nothing smart about it. We're retards for a reason. You got outretarded
Next week?
I read a comment in passing who predicted that GME shorts will cover after hours and now I believe that is what's happening
I made a rather large play in the STD spac that shall not be named... hopefully the vote next Wed doesn't screw this up for me.
Actually make that 100! Just bought 50 more when it was $10. Since this is going well, might as well put another $1K into $BB tomorrow, but we'll see!
Our baby still running.
The fact he held them through yesterday is absurd.
You'll do well in the long run. Chop a tiny bit from gold, silver, and commodities and put it towards crypto, GBTC, ETHE, GDLC.
Is it possible for $BB to go down?
1100 shares strong - Headed to the moon  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 

Thoughts on share price for 1/21 vs 2/20ish?  
Wondering if I should do the ol buy on rumor sell on news or hold a bit longer
My God man may you bless me with as many tendies. I dumped everything and put in today.
Pls tesla breakout
Is this guy just a dollar store version of the legendary Daniel Loeb?
Is Stimmy not priced into GME? LOL
IMO it depends on what Biden will do next. What's going to happen in the Middle East? Russia? Venezuela? Saudi Arabia? War or peace or sanctions? And what about US oil subsidies? So many questions, so little answers.
They released the details already,  clean energy isn't in it. But he wants another package after this one that will have clean energy and whatnot. 

RIP my ICLN FDs
It’s at 42.60 after hours ...
Anybody got a Wendy’s application for this guy Melvin that keeps messaging me? He says he’s in deep with some loan sharks idk
As the other redditors have explained there are many factors at play which determine a contract's price. I'd simply reiterate that the stock price is one underlying value which directly affects your option contact's value. 

For example:
If I sell you an option to buy a bar of gold today for $1,000 and the price of a gold bar is also $1,000, then your option is not worth anything (because you can buy the gold bar in the market for the same price I'm giving you the option for). However, if tomorrow, the price of a bar of gold is $1,200, all of a sudden the option I sold you to buy the bar of gold for $1,000 has a higher worth. Most people would sell the option to buy the gold and pocket the profit before the option expires (in case the price of gold bars drops below $1,000 tomorrow). Other people might exercise their option at expiration, and hope that gold is worth more than $1,000 (so they can sell it for a profit or hold on to it long term, if that's their goal).

Just replace "gold bar" with "stock option" in the example above and that's the general idea.

I didn't realize that most people don't hold options all the way until expiration and instead sell them for a profit until I started trading options. That was a big learning point for me, personally.
I just saw that. We want 45!
My boy always said the first mil is the hardest
Just want to pop in and say fu MSFT 🖕

One thing that jumped at me is you need higher life insurance on your wife. If she passes, you will need support for your daughters. Babysitter/nanny/whatever. Getting the things done that your wife contributes to the family is probably a lot more than $100K.
Yeah they are retarded unless you have a ton of capital and you're 100% okay with the stock fucking mooning and the strike you chose being cool with the profit. I waited until literally this week to a sell a  CC on my Gamestop shares. Feel ya brotha.
Free money
11 @ 26 Average, but I got a 4/16 $30c contract at $3.60.
Haha thanks! It has been an insanely emotional Rollercoaster these past 2 weeks. Not sure how much more I can handle.
Damn! You’re double dipping on the massive gains with BB and TLRY!
I've only bought something like 2 shares @ 19, first time making profit actually
Should I buy more tomorrow ?
And I see these posts that say there is for sure a bubble.   The problem is a bubble can only be a bubble if it pops.    So in the end you have one group saying it isn't a bubble and others that are.   If it is a bubble it will pop and you will be right.   If it doesn't pop you will be wrong.   In the end what will happen will happen.   If you are so sure it will then short it and make a fortune.   Otherwise pronouncements about what will happen are meaningless.    I mean it is easy to make a guess on what will happen if you have no actual interest in what happens.    A little different to place a 50k bet that it will or won't.
The 1/29 65 calls are basically worthless at the moment but quarterly earnings are set for 1/26 so
I’m hopeful
Melvin really tried to release a seekingalpha post talking shit about us
Best of luck to you too and thanks for the response. 

"those degends." 😆 lol

Honestly i still have no idea. Maybe sell 3 shares from GME , and put it in ATVK? 

Well, i cant lose with these stocks anyway. 

Well, i hope i wont sit between 2 chairs with this. :)
Found the guy in wsb who needs to learn options.
i guess DFV is going to be the hero of all these memes for awhile… :P
bold of you to assume ill live to be 60
Why
i don't think they allow pen ney stonks here
Yes
“Average person”?  I think you may be overestimating yourself a tad bit there, my friend.
I know I’ll get shit on for this but I wish there was a separate GME Thread holy fuck.

Some of my friends ski patrol and they have had mixed experiences. Some love it. One friend, who is a paramedic and arguably the most well trained on his patrol hates it because the boss power trips and essentially ignores modern changes and advancements in equipment and methods. 

Generally speaking, patrolling for the benefits (ski pass) probably isn’t worth it.
Easy 20% tomorrow
I am not sure, but I think the more pertinent question is how you filed taxes for the entity. Was it a sole proprietorship/disregarded entity? In real estate, mixing multiple properties in one entity has the potential for tax implications, although I am not knowledgeable enough to know what they all might be, especially not knowing what type of real estate you might invest in in the future.
With due respect, 1st amendment is nothing about companies banning free speech, but about public government banning free speech. I am sure some are always more than welcome to vent on streets and I have no problem, but given what happened on Capitol hill last Wednesday, the kind of politics shouldnt be allowed to share information as same as terrorists sharing the information since both equally share and promote the violence, if anything else. 

Agree. From investment perspective, this means that whatever the social media does, they will be criticized since they cant satisfy everyone. It's like investing in pharmaceutical industry, where one FDA approval means mooning, while another FDA denials means red days. There are so many other business models that can outperform social media, so I wouldnt really spend much on it.
Better saddle up and buy some GME shares, welcome.
Infrastructure plan is phase 2 releasing in Feb
GME DONT stop 😩😩😩
He and his family cannot go abroad at the same time.
Already broke 40s, it’s at 42.60
I mean what is a 5-10% drop when your up 100% 😆
Try it and let us know what happens.

No it means prices for everything are going up and everyone else wages stagnate
Suck it melvin.
I still remember my pin.
What a condescending tone? They really don’t get that stock market is just emotions expressed in numbers. A dick waving retard buying a stock option for a mooning stock is no different than a suited melvin capital guy trying to spread doom and gloom for his shorts to work. At least the tendies guy is playing with his own money unlike these MM chutiyaas.
Vale has done me well so far
strikes up to 75 are being opened tomorrow! TO THE MOON!
Fuck TAN
Too late to fuck with B.B.? As a Canadian, investing in Blackberry always seems like a bad idea.
Yea sure
Has anyone checked on Melvin? I'm worried for him.
I’ll admit sometimes I FOMO into shit. I bought BB a few weeks ago just because I kept seeing it pop up here. 

So serious question- why is it popping?
godspeed son

PLTR 50$ 5/21
let ARKG and ARKK run and hopefully watch TSLA 860c print
The CRA did not design the TFSA well. Everything that happens in your TFSA is tax-free and they cannot touch including options. Some Canadians have become millionaires in their TFSA and the CRA cannot touch it. The only limit on the TFSA is the contribution room, any amount you go over is taxed at 1% per month. Dividends earned in the TFSA are also tax-free.

Now get out there and buy some fucking GME! To the moon!
I said buy puts you stubborn fuck.
Each call contract allowed him to buy 100 shares at $20 each, he could have just exercized the 1000 contracts and buy 100 000 shares at $20 each, or $2m, and then own 100 000 shares more. Instead of spending $2m he just sold the contracts.
⬆️ 🚀
Sold yesterday to buy more gme. Worth buying in again ?
Lets fucking goooo Nak
1. Sell a call option for ABC Corp at $X for Jan 8 at strike price of $Y. This means someone has the right to buy 100 shares at $Y from you.

2. You own 100 shares of ABC Corp which means you are covered. If you didn’t own the 100 shares and they exercise, you MUST purchase 100 shares at whatever the price is and sell them all at $Y.
1000 shares of BB at $10.30 on margin 🥲
Buy shares please
Thanks. I was down big until today.
I was doing you a favor.

When i say don't invest in a stock, it soars. 

You are welcome.
These pumps are getting straight up retarded

Hahahaha what

Advice for coping with selling my 1/22 $7 GME calls in September?
ICLN hitting 33 tomorrow or nah
$12 for 3/19 or $15 for 3/19 hmmmmm
I LOVE YOU RETARDS! some dumbass put the rocket emoji next to GME and I dropped loads let’s fucking go
There will eventually be a downward correction. GME has a 2.18B market cap meaning a fair market price is 33.13.

When this first popped huge that was actually a market correction because it was severely underpriced. It wasn’t the squeeze. What we witnessed today was Genuine buying from people interested in the company now that Cohen and his team have board seats. Naturally some of this price increase is shorts covering, but the big time shorts have yet to cover. I foresee a series of consecutive days like we had today before Melvin and Company are forced to cover sending the price skyrocketing and then absolutely plummeting as everybody takes profits. But I imagine it will still settle relatively high.
Do you see Biden maintaining military spending despite possible democratic pressure? That’s my biggest worry with this play.
I'm sure they'll have to raise them many more times over the next couple years
And we won’t fucking stop
No
Massive sell wall?
So might dump at open?
Not until it actually squeezes
In what world do their financials not look good for the stock price?? Even after the recent stock movement they are trading at just over 1 p/e ratio which is insanelylow for online retailers. They have strong brand recognition (some of it for the wrong reasons i will give you that), 300% growth in online sales, new all-star chewy management and are massive in other areas such as collectables. Their business model is changing and if RC succeeds in his vision its easily over $50 WITHOUT a squeeze.
VANCOUVER, BC, Jan. 14, 2021 /CNW/ - Mountain Valley MD Holdings Inc. (the "Company" or "MVMD") (CSE: MVMD) (FRA:20MP) is pleased to announce that it has received approval from the Canadian Intellectual Property Office for the patent filing around its Quicksome™ technology.  The patent approval is the first for MVMD in the Canadian marketplace to pass formal allowance stage, formally protecting the process in Canada for Preparation of Desiccated Liposomes for Use in Compressible Delivery Systems.
Alright, MM are probably going to be in shambles tomorrow so they will have no chance but to sell, the only hope they have is the three day weekend to try to dump.
Gme popping now ? Wth
Holding reckless 45c FDs 🥲
Long term bullish for the economy. Short term 🤷‍♂️
GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
For anyone thinking about buying OCGN tomorrow it is going to rocket at open.

Wait for a dip either on the day or several days after - the stock won’t really move until the phase 3 results are out and the FDA approves the vaccine (so like Feb or March). 

TLDR don’t FOMO Ocugen.
CCP
They printing now
50 by open
Ohhh gotchu. So I just purchased 11c 1/29. So I’d need BB (currently at 10.4) to rise to 11 to be in the money. Anything above that and I I’d be on the moon? 🚀🚀

OH. MY. FUCK. GME. IM CLOSE. KEEP GOING.

That would be some shit
I have a confession to make: my finger was literally about to click “sell” on GME up until the last second of the market, but I decided not to. I’m fucking glad I kept in, I was down bigly 😅
GME 2/2023 $0p
Tell her we weren't aware of our collective power until now
It may hit close to 3$ by end of next week but it should squeeze a bit extra by end of month.

I’m in at 1.54
Maybe they’ll do it like steel gang lol
All in 0dte GME calls tomorrow? Is that crazy?
Welp indeed

GME about to be the most valuable company by Wednesday next week
haha IKR? I saw a reddit comment about "dark horse" investments and decided to buy some as a joke. Then I threw a little bit of gamble money at it in the hopes they can turn it around with this new CEO.
Rough crowd in here. Kind of irritating that China’s early negligence helped this virus spread and now their economy is benefiting. Also sad, our “freedom loving people” couldn’t wear a mask or social distance which fucked US and Europe while China’s totalitarianism  contained it. Score one for their repressive government.

> Perhaps you could diversify another way, like a REIT or dividend stocks.

Adding bond funds isn't about diversification, it's about stability and downside protection. In no way are REITs or dividend stocks comparable to bonds/bond funds.
I’m pretty sure they should be reporting income to the Danish but if so, it is entirely legal (might be certain breaches regarding insurance or something similar).

Even if it isn’t, it’s pretty hard to enforce unless they watch fish markets and give the fishermen a choice between becoming a legitimate part of the Danish fishing  industry or fines, in which case it’s not exactly the worst issue either.

People have to make a living the UK can no longer provide them and have the means to do it elsewhere, good for them

Whyyyy do I own APHA shares and not calls???? Ughhhhhh
I think we're gonna be okay
Every bit helps
Share price tend to be more volatile with less volume after hours, it is why shorts and hedgefunds can so easily manipulate share price premarket, so no probably not.
Start green end up red. Prove me wrong
He got banned for “Market manipulation” which I think is a blanket term for pump and dump but I disagree. He did put out tickers but it’s more of a sector play on a commodity. To each their own though.

Having 100% of your portfolio in GME and BB is like edging yourself for 6 hours and then exploding, except you’re exploding all day
I’m very jealous. I never seem to be able to grab these jumps.
Nobody fucking sell. I'll be buying the morning dip
Speculation goes beyond the financials. People think EV-tied companies have potential and they want to get in before the earnings reports confirm it.
I got 5x 30, 32, and 35 calls for 2/19. This will in fact be my first real yolo based on WSB and whatever happens happens. But the only way is up and I am an autist 🚀 🚀
Estimates on how much/long this PLUG / FCEL slander will affect price? I got ICLN calls ready and waiting to 🖨🖨🖨
Dude, just wanted to thank you for giving out this information..I’ve been trading options for about a year and never really understood the Debit spreads until you explained them and how they can work in your favor without the downside risk. i have 10 PSTH 35 calls for December.. going to open up some June spreads with all my GME profits. 🤝🚀 appreciate you brother
PC hardware would be sorta full circle for them.

Back in the 80's when the stores were still the Electronics Boutique branded and all the mergers happened they actually sold computers (Amigas, etc.) in addition to games. Then we know they abandoned the pc gaming segment completely. It would be ironic if they go on that direction and it saves them.

PC hardware would be a smart move because there's very limited brick and mortar competition in that space right now, and it seems like the enthusiast builder segment is really taking off (I've been building computers since high school, and I've never seen the level of participation as I see now). Microcenter is my go to, but they don't have many locations. Best Buy doesn't really focus on this area as far as in-store space goes. I think the challenge there would be that many Gamestop locations are somewhat small, so merchandising and stock space could be a challenge with all the products that are out there.
There were so many ways to be way up today and I’m down 30% lmfao
He could but just picture him exercising them tomorrow on open, shit would be wild
you lied to me
What’s that?
You know.. I'm starting to think the boomers were on to something.

Shares are pretty cool 🤠
If you're holding for the long term I think Opendoor is worth adding to your portfolio given your strategy. 

It's a few years away from profitability but it could become the Amazon of iBuyer real estate platforms. Break even on the sale and extract value while in the funnel (for buyers or sellers). 

Will take a few years to obtain necessary data but given the pile of cash and 45 days at most of holding inventory and the downside is somewhat reduced. Obviously still a speculative growth company though.
Well consensus estimates I think are .85 and the high side is over 3.00 so there's a lot to be optimistic about.
Hey so I've got another question I've been wondering and don't know who to ask sorry.

From my understanding when we trade on platforms such as MT4 we're trading CFD's through our broker and essentially betting on the way the price moves instead of actually exchanging money. 

Surely this means that any potential counterparty must also be someone trading CFD's and cannot be, for example, someone exchanging money for a holiday like another commenter suggested.

So this would mean the CFD market is just a subsection of the forex market and does not overlap with other sections such as the spot market.

However, CFD's are settled using the spot Forex market exchange rates and so liquidity remains high even though you can only trade with other CFD traders.

Is this right?

Sorry for lengthy paragraphs just difficult to wrap head around lol.
Waste of time sadly
Getting my puts ready.

Yes , very undervalued.

Stupid rainbow bears wouldn't listen.  This is the next GME.
Melvin Capital Management LP is a registered investment advisor founded in 2014 by Gabriel Plotkin, the firm’s Chief Investment Officer. 

The firm uses a bottom-up, fundamental research-driven process to identify investments employing a long-short equity strategy.

...'bottom-up' in this case would appear to be quite literal. Legs spread, back arched, crying for daddy not to use the big thick green dildo again

GME GANG + BB GANG GET IN!

DOUBLE TROUBLE

There is a difference between trading and investing. Investing you can do a good job for a reasonable amount of time/effort. Trading you cannot because the space is incredibly competitive, as retail you don't have the technology and your costs are higher on a per trade basis.

I don't think an excellent student in college has a reasonable shot (>1%) at finding a profitable trading strategy nowadays. source: I am a professional trader.
And BB 😂😂😂
Weeklies will be the death of me
Worth getting in at 1.40?
meanwhile Hyundai recalls 77,000 kona Ev's over 14 battery fires in the last 2 years, GM also recalled 70,000 EV's over battery fire risk during high states of charge. Teslas battery fire rate is lower than other automakers and their crash safety scores are the highest tested by the NHTSA. seems like Tesla is the higher quality and safer option compared to the competition.

What does puts expiring have to do with it though? I thought puts and calls don’t affect market price in any way?
link?
Well if you buy calls and stock drops $5 you lose big and it may not come back.
Gme really is retarded. I hope y’all make tendies
I just bet on the short squeeze and Melvin Capital + BoA have so many short positions, this will heavily move the stock when they are forced to close. Like getting halted heavy.
ok true. That's what I traded today as well. Bought 3810Cs mid day sold for a loss and got 3800Ps. Do you only trade short term?
Don’t do that then lmao 😂
yeah true, i think im gonna put 80% in ETFS and 20% in EV and clean energy with biden becoming president

Also, if you have dependents that increase your stimulus, buy their clothes at Goodwill for the next year or so and spend that money on video games.

Heh, ya sounds about right. To be honest though, if you've achieved step #1 then you're in a good spot. 

Better than me anyway. So cheer up!
True that, now we know. Shit even wallstreet journal recognizes.
100 on margin at 9.64. doing my part
You have a really poor understanding (or a deliberate, willful misinterpretation) of how exchanges work

Market making algorithms use bots, yes.   Do you really think market makers should pay someone to sit around and make markets like it's 1893?
Risk of $TSLA has gone up.

Also keep in "post hoc" fallacy isn't valid in the stock market when it comes to explosive gains. The higher the gains in the past the lower the gains the future. Even with an asset with Bitcoin this applies. Each peak is seeing less and less of a gain. 

$TSLA is has seen +1000% gains if you bought below 60$(360$ pre split). This implies future gains will much lower. 

If you have seen large gains from this stock, definitely a good time to take profits while they're available considering the risk. Consider partial profits if you are willing to continue holding the risk. Might not be a bad idea to purchase some low strike puts as insurance if you want to continue holding...especially if you hold a lot.
I can't wait to see what happens after he hops on board with BB like he did GME, banks will lose money cause they have fucked people for so long so we are doing trading our selfs and making way more then with there help.
True lol I can just dump it in more ICLN calls (April or further it’s looking like) in that case. If it goes up I can be happy with what I have
Joey B is God
It should be
Oh we mooning mooning tonight boys
Every time I see “GME 🚀” a little precum drips out and my pants are soaking fucking wet.
ALMOST 43 GME
This is what's going to happen. Bond yields will keep going up until it starts to bankrupt some companies. Then we really crash like last March.
7:15 tonight.
He did today.
I literally blinked and GME rose to $42 LMAO
Paperhands GME regretting they already sold
Burberry all the way, or was it Blackberry?
They write software and their products are used in electric cars, fucking spacex rockets, and a shitload of other stuff. Not a phone company which is why they just sold their phone patents.

Not retarded, visionary. So go full retard and get your ass to tendietown, ya freaking artists.
FUCK I used all my margin on GME and GI K bud I wish I put in more
Forgetting about it and finding a new play? Or maybe spend your life savings buying GME in post right now? Either are fine.
65 offers on a house round here (SoCal). Think the market is just fine.
It's never been more popular tbh. That pokemon go summer really was the catalyst.

Now for new sets? Gamestop preorders are shut off for new card sets within hours. It's insane. Go to Walmart. Hang out by the card section. You'll legit see so many ppl scoping it out to resell. It's ridiculous
Got some leaps and stonks ... let’s go 🚀

If shares and leaps its never too late. Even after the big gain they are heavily undervalued
I’m not entirely sure, I’m in the camp of knowing how to read, but not exactly how options contracts work during a reverse merger. Sorry for not being more helpful.
I see those tissues ;)
Damn I think I bought Burberry

Sure, but he’s still super long and I don’t blame him for taking a million off the table. He’s autistic, not stupid.
I saw him in an alley. Folks lined up around the block to fuck him in the ass at a discount. Tryna cover. 

He was crying.
Well, I guess my shares are getting taken tomorrow at $40.00/share due to covered calls.   Will buy in next week when they come back to reality.

I'm still wrestling with that.  I have a couple of hobbies I am getting into more deeply and am doing lots and lots of work on my house and getting into shape.  I don't think I have mastered it yet.

Sprouts is currently trading at 6.43x EV/EBITDA. This is a very attractive valuation for this company.

* The Fresh Market was acquired in 2016 for \~6.9x EV/EBITDA.
* Save-A-Lot was acquired in 2016 for \~7x EV/EBITDA.
* Whole Foods was acquired in 2017 for \~11x EV/EBITDA.
* Roundy's was acquired in 2015 for about \~7x EV/EBITDA.
* Smart & Final was acquired in 2019 for about \~6.5x EV/EBITDA.

We saw $250k of the January 2022 $20P's sold to open for $2.62.

We then saw $250k of the March $20C's bought to open for $1.65 each.

We have also seen more aggressive selling of the March $21P for $2 on the 11th.

\-------------------------------------

The chart is fantastic and is a technical breakout, but my money says they're getting acquired. I am very long.
GME is just the best thing isn't it. The fact they haven't even brought out more shares to increase capital means they are trying to fuck the shorters who made a mess of them initially
Uhh what's the GME news in AH?
Can't Stop.
Can't believe I made the right decision and pumped another 10k in earlier, while taking a huge dump and reading 🚀🚀🚀 DD

How much does your guy cost? Have you looked into whether your coverage is changing at all to save that $300 a year?

Still you. Congrats on the gains yo

If your leaps are super far in the money do they end up becoming harder to sell?

After hours just went past $42...
Idk, maybe “congrats on your first market gains, try doing this to find some better stock picks”
I love you
Just found out a cheat code. Everytime I set a limit buy on GME it flys and my order doesn't fill.🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 $GME $70EOW
Lesssgoooo!!!
How many times we're going to do this to these stocks until someone gets legit pissed and try to change the rules lol
Well, it depends. If they plan to keep funding it then it may make sense to hold it. Not worth the $1300 now if that’d be the end of it. 

If they expect you to fund it going forward, yes I’d likely surrender as cash value life insurance is a crap investment.

Don’t sell PLUG but buy BB
I do to, and I think that will be the focus. But it would be nice if he mentioned CE.
BB is the new GME will be 20 in 2 months... Kramer will pumping it in 3 weeks

That's when I bought the shares and started selling calls. I've made good enough money on it that I'm not even mad. Strike is above my average cost and I've sold 4 or 5 contracts and took all that premium before this happened.

If you created a bank account without her, does your mother have the means to punish you? If so, you are not adulting. You might want to consider whether your parent's financial support is of great enough value to you that you will surrender your autonomy for it. Right now you think that the allowance is worth humoring her, and allowing her to control you. In 10 years, you'll be concerned with access to the vacation house or your inheritance.

Most of the just OTM puts I'm selling all go worthless in a day or two lol like yesterday I sold the 24, 25 strike for GME and today sold the 27 strike, all about to be worthless and I collected over a grand
This is 💎 handed Conviction. You deserve every penny. Life changing money and you did it facing a lot of objection. You could have sold any time in the last few months and made bank but you did what you had to do. You have also given others an opportunity to make huge gains as well. This is the way. You sir are a legend. Well done.
Because BB got a big dick

We’ve been talking about long options.  Nobody crazy enough to sell gme calls uncovered is here I hope. 

Hey look, I’m very deep, and have been since august.  I don’t know for sure what the expiration date is going to do, but I know a lot of newly bought and long held options are going to expire, so they’ll be sold back or exercised, and there’s been fucktons of puts open as well. My concerns are still there, but I’m holding.
Literally just checked that too lol
Never. Stick. Your. Dick. In. Crazy.
These diamonds hands kept me steady on both GME and BB. What a day!
this will be the most epic squeeze since VW
Well done on the Tesla stock btw. I've been sitting on 25 (100 post split) shares since May 2017. Originally had 50, but I sold half of it a in February of last year to recapture my initial investment (still kicking myself over that, lol).
I never play puts/shorts on a position I was previously long on. It feels doubly worse if it turns out you paper-hands’d it.
Limit up tonight ☝️💪🏼🔥

Can't squeeze just by buying calls
Bought 10 more GME AH just because
im going to be blamed for your yeeyee 55calls expiring worthless tomorrow. I hate everyone who buys 55s expiring tomorrow. I'd love to be wrong though.
GME 44c expiring tomorrow were only $1.90 today 😎
so wats the indicator of shorts covering and actual sqeeze starting?
I mean, you’re 18, a legal adult. You just do it. 

I can’t comment on the family issues you apparently face.
Was this day trading?
now this is getting weird.
Gme bears in shambles.
Positions or ban
The huge problem no one is talking about is the bond market.  With an uptick in rates, the market will sell off and probably won't get much of a bounce.
If you want part of the dumping trend
Someone’s shorting 50k shares at 43 after hours like what are you gonna do buy those at 75 tomorrow?
Agreed, if BB can get people beyond their past to their future, this shit will easily be 30 or more

good luck.
Hahaha for people in at $3/share, selling $50 FDs are a slam dunk
It's over $1 and has previously been trading at $5. 🤷🏻
CRSR where you going???
hahaha that’s fair. I can’t do the IV math. I didn’t think it mattered if it hits 1.5$ which I think it will. If you buy enough that you can exercise the calls  @ .5 (so you’ll need $50 to exercise it) you can literally cerci see the calls at the top, and sell the shares immediately at whatever price. This’ll minimize some risk & fairly cheap way to do it
42 and rising my friend
yep thats, basically how my day weny
I highly recommend Dave Ramsey, financial personality. I say personality loosely. He has a proven method with his 7 baby steps. Sounds like you’re doing well but I would highly recommend his classes and process.

who needs gme when you can buy bb 8c 1/15 @ 0.2 kek
I’m glad because I was starting to get worried haha
WSB has the power to move the market now.
Did you buy before or after it went up?
It’s things like the GME phenomenon that truly makes you realise that this fucking community is making history...and i’m not joking 🤴🏻
Can we do amc next?
I had 200 10.5 1/15s... sold half for 50% gain yesterday. Sold half of remaining for .90 or 300% gains. Sold the rest at 1.3 or about 380%ish. 

Had I just held onto my full position until this afternoon, I would’ve turned a 6k bet into 32k

I just hate leaving money on the table
yep thats, basically how my day went
I do have a small short on tesla, I would say to the argument that the bubble will never pop is that no stock in history has stayed went this high in so little time on no fundamentals, and not crashed soon after, I like to say "I can't predict the future but I can learn from the past"
Somebody let me know if GME hits $45
OMG 1% AFTER HOURS WE ARE ALL RICH.........
Hold Nio.. You got gains locked in by getting in at $8/share. Who's to say Nio won't balloon and split in the future like Tesla? Honestly any good news will keep pushing that floor higher
What’s your take? Why u say dis?
>Can't wait to be paying 80% taxes each pay check a few years from now with bread at $10 a loaf.

lol you haven't been paying attention? taxes are so feudalistic bro - the real answer is for no one to be allowed to anything any we just lease from corporations.
GME, GME, GME!

GUH
Buy the top. You belong here.
Just bought some BB and holding GME.
For a very brief period yesterday someone changed that first sentence to "Melvin Capital Management LP ***was*** a registered investment advisor" lol
There’s absolutely nothing wrong with him taking that profit. He rode that horse all the way to expiration, for like 16 months. He’s earned it.
Yep. Shocking how many people have no fucking idea what's going on. Just dumping money into hopes and prayers.
Wait until no one qualifies for financing anymore when the rates go up.
Isn't exercising a bought call stating that I am going to buy the option at the purchased price? Am I not allowed to turn around and sell that?
Superior? Maybe. That will outperform MAC? Not a chance
Liquidity decreases the more ITM
In other news Tesla stock jumps.  Tesla fanboys say it's all due to brightening fundamentals as a result of the recall.
That’s like 140 mcchickens.
Just bought more shares. About to buy some more.

THEY'RE UP FOR CRAZIER STUFF THOUGH.
April might be too soon for a Paris deal don't you think?
Holy shit i thought my BB $10 calls were going to expire worthless tomorrow. I just accepted my losses, and now I don't know what to do with myself

When I have a low priced option like that I almost always turn it into a bull debit spread with a higher strike price option. For some reason I didn't do that with these. Could have sold the 10.5c for .02 instead and still made $50/contract if it stays above 10.50.

GUH.
Welcome to the jets
He probably sold them, he posted an update already
Am I the only one who thinks GME can hit $200 next month? shorts haven't even started covering yet, once they do, this stock might jump 100% in a single day
Yeah, but not tomorrow dude. Plus, if it's really a MASSIVE selloff, then why not wait a day for confirmation? If it's massive, then missing it by a single day won't matter.
💎✋ brother.
LAST COURTESY CALL TO BOARD GME ROCKET DEPARTING SOON

RESERVE YOUR SEATS NOW
YOU ARE NOT TOO LATE
yep, thats basically how my day went
Depends the time you plan on holding for, i think this has great potential as a longer term stock. You could sell at $3 and weeks later find it to be at $10.
Well, he's making a shit ton so
I have some family friends who are “mountain hosts”, some resorts call them greeters, ambassadors, etc. they basically ski around and talk to people, and occasionally get posted to certain areas like the main entranceway, near lift lines, etc. They’re retired and they love it, but they’ve also lived in this mountain community for 40+ years so they’re constantly seeing friends, hanging out, enjoy skiing, etc. 

Instructing is a bit more like babysitting, they say. 

Guiding is a bit more like babysitting too, but with a client that might try to kill you.
Market closed on Monday?!?!
Yeah man! Bet it all!
Cause we said so
Isn't it a 0.5% DD? Their buying power is 10.000,- I think, so that's very marginal...

But anyways pls Tesla and Apple gap up tm.
Melvin about to work in wendy's and give $10 bj to wsb
Hahaha alright kiddos I know this new society trains you to not accept humor without being triggered, but it was a joke nonetheless 😂 But, everything I said was still true, young, white, gifted 40k from a wealthy grandfather, which I give you props for turning it Into what it is now. PS- I’m white/black 

All I’m saying is, most people don’t have 50k even in their 40’s, but it’s good to see you using it wisely in investing for your future instead of what a lot of kids would do and blow it!
The best of luck to you my fellow.

Lottery ticket was 15c for tomorrow at around 0.02 a piece.. I either lose $50 or make a good fucking profit. (Only did $50 since BB railed me in the ass last year.)
I looked at my GME order history, I had orders in for GME 30c leaps at $2, $2.5, $3, $3.5, canceled all of them.  I'm a retard.
Damn it is a good time to buy O

Oh I know. I’m just stunned at what I just read.
Grab shares of SNDL if you’re interested in the cannabis segment — trading at ~$0.69/share, they’ve gotta get up past $1 within 6 months or they’re delisted. That said, a focus on concentrates is definitely where the market is headed imho.

How do I determine what a good strike price is? What’s the benefit for going above or below the current stock price?

Looks like shorts could be covering aftermarket for gme. Shot it up to 43 will probably bleed it down.
What's a safe bet stock for the next week
Get on the BB train early in the morning. It’s a tendie rocket incoming
Tomorrow's the 🚀🚀🚀 for all of us.
It's a good one for sure!
It would seem that when you have a paid account with an actual brokerage, they supply earnings, projections and estimates of how many pre market-open buy orders (that you can submit even in free trading apps like Robinhood) there are and how they're instant execution when the market opens, will drive up share prices. 

I put in an order via Robinhood, for shares of Petco at around 7AM, with a max buy of $30/share, and was able to buy in at $21/share. Unfortunately, Petco didn't blow up like poshmark did, so the gains were minimal, but you live and learn.

I’m not your financial advisor and I’m also down 355 dollars lol if you can’t stomach losses then you should probably sell. But if you think that FB is gonna keep dropping then yeah sell. That’s why stop losses exist and you probably should have put one on if you’re hurting this bad over 300 dollars

I think its a common misconception here that we actually know the current short interest on GME...that data is only released like every two weeks and the next release is scheduled for 12/27...

Until then, we can only guess how many shorts are still in the market
Or buy now? AH still open to wsb retards
It had a great day, no need for the sarcasm.
You can make profit it on it tomorrow. Just sell near open.

I honestly don't get it. Everybody seems to just HATE oil, but I've only heard two legitimate bear cases for oil:

1. Saudi and Russia potentially flooding market. But Saudi just voluntarily pulled back 1mil bb/d of production to help increase prices, so don't see that happening soon. 
2. Investors are forward looking and may be reluctant to invest in oil when the market is moving towards green energy. I do agree with this, however if oil booms over its previous price high it will create a short term surge in stock values and there may be a temporary but heavy rotation into the sector.

Jpow buying tens of billions of mortgage bonds a month still can't keep that bubble pumped? Yikes.
I am guessing AMD hits 100 and blows through 110 rather quickly.  TSM went bonkers after earnings, for good reason, and I expect AMD will too.  Like you I have been around long enough to have seen stocks fizzle on amazing earnings beats and that's why I too bought LEAPs a while back.  

AMD  $70C 1/20/23; Sold AMD $80P 2/19/21

Retard question: why would Biden be talking green and clean tonight, and not at the inauguration speech instead?
It’s actually a really solid DD, let me find the link
I have NOKidea what I am doing, but I think we can all afford to lose $50

Looks like Biden isn’t gonna say anything about this lol
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
So what should I do tomorrow, I'm holding shares at $31. Looks like aftermarket is mooning tho
Just wait, Dem president means an inevitable "we're gonna take dem guns!" freakout causing a shortage + increase in price.
Guess it's back to BBBY FDs then my man
This is both ambitious and conservative, depending on who you ask

For all fellow ICLN holders feeling betrayed by Biden, buy HCLN instead, Canada is actually pushing into green energy quickly unlike America who only says it for show
Looks like they have a lot of buying to do for that ETF. Largest holding is only 2.9%
We are the market now
Im just keeping 10% in cash so I can buy some dips if a correction comes.
So when is this short squeeze for GME expected to be over?
Thank Mr. Melvin, very cool
Can I sell my calls first ?
I completely understand people who feel a massive selloff incoming. Even the bulls will tell you the market is overextended.

What I don't get is trying to time it by shorting indexes. If it's gonna be a big massive selloff, then missing it by a day won't matter. Just wait for it to actually start before getting your puts.
Not enough volume.
yeah im extremely blessed to have both my grandpas pay for my college so thats why im using the 50k on investing instead since i would of had close to 6 figures in student debt if i wanna get my masters too. Its insane to me just thinking about how unfair college tuition is, education should be free imo
7 shares tsla
Hear me out tards if we can do to AMC what we did to GME it will be legendary.
I guess it’s finally time for airlines and cruises
Lmao I’m so glad I created a bed reddit handle and re joined this sub, I love this place.

Haha I'm going through the community college route for my first 2 years, so the tuition is dirt cheap (1.5k a semester) unlike most other kids chasing the big-name universities then drown in debt. I'm saving a shit ton on money this way.
Absolutely. Most shorts haven't even started covering yet.
Thanks, glad you liked it! Mostly agree with the risk-off sentiment, a trip to sub 3700 is long overdue.
You're right, I corrected my post. It's still biotechnology.
Damn bro how much did that set you back :P
I once worked as a line cook, but making grab and go breakfast and such *before the restaurant opened*. So it was low stress because we weren’t making orders, and it was nice because the time flew by.
Big dick energy right here
Lol invested 2000 bucks in shares for the first time in my life and if I pull out right now after purchasing it like 3 hours ago I made 200 bucks. That’s chump change to all of you but holy fuck i’ve never gotten that much so easily before, love you all lol so glad I found this sub like 3 days ago

Yeah same I have a yolo call for tomorrow which isn’t looking good, then some Feb, April and July.. I might go for more Aprils like you, was even considering the Jan 2022s. Good luck to you as well 🙏🏼
As they say, profits are profits
Make sure you do the swing calibration on the driving range or else it will feel weird to play
Sold a few small positions today but waiting to see if gme drops a bit after hours.  Either way, probably gonna drop another 1k into GME tonight or tomorrow pre market
We have to hold them off by talking for 5 episodes!
Nice i like this.  Do you work in sales by chance?
GME up another 6% AH.
how much michael burry made on gamestop?

Good move. Stonks only go up🚀🚀🚀

Tell him to get leaps too and maybe he will think you are smart
7k for being a paper handed bitch and selling on wednesday

All I heard was yolo my life savings on BB tomorrow morning.

Eye eye Captain!!! BB 1/22 15c 
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀👍👍👍👍👍👍
I'm not down,  just capping my profits
No! Good luck to YOU... and your...options! Good luck on ALL OF THEM!
No shit. Id rather be a cunt anyday than an emotional idiot
I’m so mad my options expired worthless before this mooning
But they'll keep fucking you in other ways, and long after you're done fucking them.

This seems like it's something you may need to learn through experience.
i literally was gonna shove 15K in BB today but it spiked so much already :(
it’s almost like high schools and colleges are working with chegg. had a college test once and it was straight from chegg/quizlet. they don’t give a fuck, everyone is making money expect you of course. you’ll be making money soon once you get your degree :)
Bought in a couple months ago with 40k. Look at the daily MAs. Were about to get some golden crosses heading into spring with tons of space to gap up. This is going to make me a bunch of money really fast and it started with its move today. It's now on the fringe of the gap up areas. Yes please.
So bc I wouldn’t buy into GME at all bc I’m a bitch and keep feeing like I missed out, I downloaded Robinhood and deposited $2000and rage bought BB and Tilray calls earlier. My money is doubled. This is the way
What rules? Get the fucking money
I am going long on ICLN since mid 2020. I am like clean energy as well
Im feeling it out. I think this thing can come close to $15 if not go by it
Just bought 50 shares LETS GO KINGS 💎🤝💡
Futures are gonna be crazy at 7:15
So if I have about 300 shares at $15 would it benefit me to write any calls at this point or hold onto as many shares as I can?
*praying hands*
BW is making a comeback, all bull no bear
Had the opportunity to buy tilray at 7€ but my dumbass was waiting for it to drop down to 6€ 😭
I’m gonna join in on that
Just picked up 116 shares, Choo Choo to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
As a software engineer, I didn't care about titles until I got well along in my career.  Things like raising money or coming into an organization at a high level really do start depending on titles. It's not a hard and fast rule, but my current title, which I've had for ten years or so, surprised me at how it suddenly opened far more doors _outside of SW eng organizations_ (talking to CEOs, etc.) I would have believed.
Well played, sir 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
It’ll be a nice side hustle
REALLY?  FUCK I MIGHT NEED TO RETHINK THIS.

So you're saying EVERYONE is going to get more detailed fleet data than Tesla, then take that data and develop a more cutting edge AI ingestion system than Tesla, then deploy more FSD capable vehicles than Tesla, and do it all with better electric vehicles than Tesla?

google it or call your broker. Usually they exchange using a ratio of some sort based on the prices. If you dont have enough shares required for 1 share of google they just pay you the cash equiv.

Good luck to you.

Jokes on all you, I been using Robinhood on my BlackBerry to buy GME playing 4D chess mates.
Most people have calls until April. Only bags they’ll be holding is Birkin

Nah mate. Anything can be a helipad!
Sell what? By exercising, you purchased the shares and the option contract now disappears.
All of it

damn lmao u were a lil off
I blew up my account shorting PLTR, even though I made money on the way up. Sold short the day before it blew up 25%, woke up late and I went to 0.

I feel you. I never short anymore, the strength of this sub is unwieldly.
Whoops meant 1/27
Pics or it didnt happen
As soon as the new BB is available for pre order I’m buying it
No, it just raises the price of everything low skilled workers create.

Dont know why i get angry reading this
stocks. I'm down A LOT. so painful.
because dems found their new fall guy (Manchin) who will just vote with Rs to get Dems the ability to act like they tried.
I mean it grew 140% in 2 days ... it will prob dip down and then go right back up. Just saying
Paper hands mcgee sold many of my shares after the dump. I was left with a mere 507 shares. So yeah it's TSLA all over again where I made money, but lost out on so many potential tendies, the good kind too, 12$ a box

lmaoo this comment is so endearingly stupid
Tight. Tight. Tight.
Anyone know why robinhood got rid of FIT?
I looked, and IWM is up roughly +125% off its lows from March, which is about +25% for the year (Feb. 2020 - Jan. 2021). QQQ is up about +95% from March and 35% for the year. It's close, so, your point is well taken. Still, the recent buying has felt more or less indiscriminate, so the rug pull is gonna be pretty brutal when it comes.
Im still far from breaking even with my losses that i had last year. But i love this community and you guys are awesome. Basically been holding GME since $26. 580 shares. Lets go for the final rip boys
Essentially yeah. But you gotta remember that a contract declines in value every single day. I'm looking at the contract right now, and since its a new one if it increased to like 10.7 tomorrow you will already make some money.

I wish you good luck my man! Make that shit print and kick your wife's bf out of your house.

try shooting for 1/29 if anything, see if you make gains and keep at it if it's still mooning by then. 

1/29 $11C x2

The truth about Tesla is they knew about the problems in their cars years before they did a recall. Why?? Because back then a recall would have tanked their company. They put profits in front of people, plain and simple. The other car companies you mentioned at least did recalls. It’s a tough business and takes decades for people to work out every kink and design flaw in a car. This is why I trust all other car manufacturers over Tesla. They have been making cars for decades and decades longer than Tesla and have consistently issued recalls whenever a problem arises in their vehicles. Tesla is reckless and dangerous, and their entire company and stock price is being propped up by idiot cult members that have no fore site or ability to see the larger picture.

"Could have bought a index fund..."

Maybe..  
That would have worked out this time.

But on average the S&P returns roughly 8% per year.  
With active trading you can make consistent returns year in year out far outperforming index funds .  
Even in a bear market.

If you’re not maxing out your margin, taking payday loans, maxing all lines of credit and taking out home equity and student loans to buy more GME then you ain’t really black 👶🏿
Haha I know bro! It’s easier as I bank with them

With days like this it might even end in the S&P 500
Is it though? Shouldn’t all other costs go up then?

If you need the money to pay your bills take it out otherwise stick to your plan if it’s working. Don’t fix what isn’t broken.

Another angle - sell covered calls to lower your cost basis and lower potential losses if you’re so concerned about a dip. Then you can just wheel down.
ARKG is mooning after hours too hell yeah

Roaring Cat.  RC.  Ok.
Your brokerage has to make an effort to submit accurate information to the exchange, so they probably automatically check for this. Even if the ticket is marked incorrectly, in my experience it will be tied out correctly by the time the trade settles and the next day's OI numbers come out. That may not be the case with your brokerage.

If you somehow end up with an up/down, this is bad for you because it means you can get assigned. Call your brokerage.
We should start bullying Melvin capital from now on, just find every short position they have and fuck it up
Ahhhh ok
Options take time for the cash to settle. It might post tomorrow. Depends on the broker, some take up to three days for options.

ChEN GOT A BIG DICK
Melvin found out why they’re called FDs
> My plan is to not count on Social Security

The reasonable worst-case scenario for SS is that nothing is done. In that case, SS will pay out ~75% of benefits starting in ~2034 and will continue at that level for the foreseeable future. Planning for $0 from SS is simply not realistic. 

As to the actual article, I think raising the FRA is one of many options that could be considered. I would hope that they also increased delayed benefits by the same (e.g. if they raise FRA from Age 67 to Age 69, also raise the delayed benefits from Age 70 to Age 72. For most people, delaying social security provides a better return as it increases the guaranteed income you receive (and no, it's not apples-to-apples to compare your stock-based portfolio return to a SS benefit).
Depends on how much you pay for the APHA
Realistically having a ten bagger is very rare. If you cash out you inital investment you really arent going to lose much in future gains since you still have 85-90% invested. Also, since its January you wont owe taxes until 2022 on your sale. 

If it were me Id sell enough to cover my initial investment plus taxes and let the rest ride.

Congrats and all but what’s up with your obsession with cats?
Hopefully soon we will have fucked 43’s asshole and move onto 44’s.
If it behaves like I think, it's a flat or up open, followed by weakness later in the morning, and hard selling in the afternoon. 

I would watch closely. Sell now if you don't want the risk. Or, sell on signs of weakness tomorrow.
It was me, I’m exercising also
This is the fucking way🚀🌙💰
Selling those shares in a contract is what I mean.
10% is 10%. Congrats on your gains! Wishing you all the best for the remainder of 2021.

My only tip would be to fund your account with more money, buy shares of solid companies and just let them ride while you do some trading on the side. I found this to be the best way to store some money for the long run while still having some side money to trade with. Ride the market up and down, maybe pick a stock with a nice dividend.

Anyway, congrats again!
$43 🤤
They don't gotta be better they just gotta be decent and undercut the price. Tesla probably gonna be solid for a long time. 300B is still a valuation for a very good company.

Little book that still bears the market- Greenblatt
Yup, releasing in Feb and ICLN going north like my pee pee
why did I dump my 1/15 gme 40c :(
Every day this week ICLN is up or down like .7%, then up half a percent after hours. Would be great if that last boost could be when the market is open. Gonna pop again soon
Returning to the lender could even maybe reduce price if they sell to pocket profit. The question is volume tho? All together they would need like 700 thousand contracts? Paying a premium on all of those, on top of the borrowing interest from the initial short, on top of the price difference they'd be currently paying for the shares themselves, is it enough to gap and over how long?
Rising up nicely now squeezy peasy
I have 300 shares and sold 3 calls at the 40 strike price. So tomorrow at expiry, the shares go away and I miss out on the gains above 40. It’s at 43 AH now

Somewhere else I saw funding for cybersecurity...hoping CRWD gets some new subscriptions!
i don't care personally. i just wanted to give you heads up.  make that money!
Ahem, he made $300k+. Nothing to shake your head at, for sure, but he did not make $600k. Impressive, but still

I made over 320% on my TOS account in less than a month. We shall see if it sticks for a while year, but I'm gonna stick with the trading platform that works for me. RH's lags cost me a lot of money, and I lost 50% on that account (a bit was my fault, of course, but their flaws cost me a lot, too).
You mean up over 6%?
He had 1/15 20c x 1000. The calls give him the right to buy 100 shares at 20 each so $2000 x 1000 contracts = $2m
I would love to work at an airport in a job that lets me walk around a lot and interact with people, maybe one of those people who helps mobility-impaired folks get through the airport on wheelchairs.

$43 now. Can't wait to see the gap open tomorrow.

How many of these shorts will want to hold over a 3 day weekend?
Bro it's at 1.9 now. My recommendation would be wait for the inevitable dip tomorrow when people take out their profits. Then buy in and wait to sell Tuesday

**Believe me when I say this as I have the experience to back it up. The people who take the longest to become successful traders always become the millionaires and billionaires. Those who dive in head first in the first year usually crash and burn in a matter of months to a few years especially in bear/bull markets like the one we're in right now. What's deceptive is those who dive in head first start out successful and then end up unsuccessful. Those who start out unsuccessful and stick with it end up successful.** 

**I can remember becoming a trader way back. The dot com bubble was in full swing back then and internet stocks were going parabolic. It felt exactly the same as the clean energy and EV sector hype of right now.** 

**So guess what?** **Every schmuck and his uncle were opening brokerage accounts and making money the FOMO was absolutely spreading like COVID it was infectious. One person would see another making money then jump on the band wagon however none of them once reflected that they were very new to the came. Had not traded a bear market. Didn't understand the concept of hedging or risk management all of which are the most important parts of trading successfully. Making money is actually the easiest part. Holding onto it though is a different matter.** 

**So at the time all of my so called friends were also making money. However I was not and I was confused by that as I was the one with the fundamental approach and the one who had studied many books and modelled themselves on billionaire investors. Gosh so many times did I nearly get FOMO and became one of them, but I didn't. In fact I suffered some of my biggest losses ever in that bull market leading up to the crash in 2001/2002.** 

**When the crash came in 2001-2002 literally all those schmucks and their uncles got obliterated and most vowed never to trade again. At this point I realized my friends were not my friends and were just holding me back. I started to value friends that added value to my life and when I realized that most of my friends subtracted value I ditched them all.**

**What happened to me though in the bear market? I absolutely thrived and was well prepared to trade it. The bear market of 2001/2002 I made my first million dollars. Meanwhile the FOMO gang and everyone else was getting their head put in a noose and internet stocks were getting slaughtered.** 

**I learned some core lessons though about accepting losses. Trading on fundamentals.    It took me roughly in total 10 years to become profitable the late 80s crash was what enticed me into markets. Now I remember back then there wasn't all these free resources for learning. Demo accounts didn't exist you had to use a simulator a long tedious process to backtest strategies. In this day and age people don't realize how lucky they are.** 

**The problem for most people is shutting the pollution that pollutes your mind out. Social media like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, the media all will stop you from becoming successful cut your ties with it. Even YouTube will stop you becoming successful. For every 1 good trading educational video there is 100 bad ones from bag holders, bad educators and portfolio pumpers. I only use Reddit for one purpose. To anonymously give back to people by giving some advice like this to my followers. AND to seek out new recruits to my fund.**

**Just remember when you start out trading. Trade on the 1hr & 1 day charts. It's much slower and the reason you should do this is it is very hard to get FOMO trading this way. You learn the same patterns needed to form a strategy. You learn price action but in a more slow controlled way. You'll also be trading with the funds and the banks which is great news as you'll learn to trade like a casino instead of learning to trade like the gambler.** 

**Anyway I don't know what happened today I have given lots of information. Value it because the chances of you seeing something like this again are remote.**

**Please don't private message me I have hundreds of people message me and I don't have time to respond, please respect my time. Also my spelling/grammar might be off I wasn't top of the class in English or any of my subjects in fact I'm a college drop out.**
Pretty much. In that example, $2 would be the cost of the call, and $8 would be the strike price, the agreed-upon-in-advance amount. 

Keep in mind that most calls are for, like, 100 shares, so the profit is a little more lucrative if the stock rises even a dollar in value.
Just got 1000 shares of $BB after hours at 10.39. Please send prayers for me.
Idk I feel like some or most stress from jobs like that is needing that job. Like I worked at Jimmy John's in high school and I didnt need that job at all. I had money saved up and no bills so we just had fun and messed around. Yeah customers can suck but if you dont care about getting fired, you can act however you want towards them. Side note we use to make Jimmy John's  pizzas with leftover bread dough and random ingredients we had. They were pretty good!
BB gang checking in! Let's ride this BBC to the moon!
Here’s a positive thing about GME.. I won’t even consider selling until at least $90. So if it crashes before then, I will never experience that “oh fuck I had my finger right on the sell button why didn’t I click it reeeee” type of regret. Bc there’s no version of me almost selling and then not selling. IM NOT FUCKIN LEAVING
Thanks for the easy 150% call gains on tilray and aphira stock, retard. Glad you mentioned aphira since I rode it's massive rocket **** into earnings 🚀🚀

awesome i appreciate the help
Something like this exactly shows how much paths can vary:

[https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/financial-independence/](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/financial-independence/)

Certainly the "ideal" would be to dump all your cash at the lowest point in your career but you run into the age-old problems of not having the money yet and not knowing when that happens.  The more money you can get in cheap would indeed make it faster.

Since the financial crisis, I think money being so "cheap" (i.e. low interest, QE, etc) it just makes any dip short-lived because money doesn't have anywhere to go, making any discount appetizing. As an accumulator and trying to stay as close to 100% invested as possible, it indeed sucks a bit.

It seems possible that less opportunities to buy dips makes retirement longer, but it's hard to say what to do about that.  For instance, I choose an asset allocation of 80/20, and something I've started to do on these dips is to pick some targets to do immediate rebalancing (so in March I did this twice with \~2-3% of my portfolio.)  So in some way I was able to capture some benefit by doing this.  But since this is already part of my investment strategy, the only real adjustment is to do some dynamic rebalancing (and to be very honest, not very scientifically.)

But is there any way to do this when your target is a 100% stock allocation?  Could you prove some sort of valuation-based stock/bond allocation that would allow you to make a big stock purchase in the future, but remain invested?  To be honest, I think people have been asking these questions for decades, it's nothing new.  And they run into the same problems -> complicated ideas that pass a backtest often fail on implementation.

[https://www.marottaonmoney.com/does-past-performance-have-anything-to-do-with-future-results/](https://www.marottaonmoney.com/does-past-performance-have-anything-to-do-with-future-results/)

Recent returns (year to year) don't show much correlation either, and any valuation-based trends have long poles - i.e. CAPE research may indicate low 10 year returns are likely at these levels but ten years is a long time to wait for a market crash if you intend to hold cash.

TL;DR - conditions may make reaching retirement an uphill climb but it's hard to find a strategy that might take advantage of this in the moment.
Yeppp saw that. Up 7%!!!  Hopefully that means good things coming tomorrow too.  Gap-up to $45-50??? 👀

Looks like a large buy went through at 5:19 that pumped it initially, been climbing since.
Seems like a combination of:

Recent contracts and innovation, expected settlement announcement on their FB lawsuit, and a bit of a short squeeze.

Reddit is control now, we are short squeezing EVERYTHING.
Huge flying tits!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
To expand on my post with us making history, what a fucking incredible feeling to just bs shoulder to shoulder through all of it , the highs (and i’m high as a 🪁) and the lows, fucking telling each other to man up and hold the line.

> Nobody crazy enough to sell gme calls uncovered is here I hope.

its not crazy, sell an option at 45. If it comes close, just buy to cover, if it falls, sell at 44. Elsewise, people are buying puts, selling a call is the same as buying a put. It's not just the options today that need to be covered mind you. There was also large purchases for all the following dates. We just added a big block of options that werent available previously.
How much left to break even?

Held for weeks watch it go down day by day, sold, it recovered in days. Of course their gonna moon, everything I sell does - BB / JMIA / GME /NIO (that was for tax purposes but I bought back in a lot higher when markets opened back up waiting for a chance to get in a dip
This actually isn't an unreasonable request.
The board probably doesn't care about short term share price and they'd like to grow the company. In December they issued 100m in shares to grow capital.
do we sell GME at opening bell or hold till close?
that’s what i got too, fuck these radio wave bastards
Yes always buy the day it goes up 40 percent
that's what happens when you don't support your fellow GME retards

After today I dont know if I can afford to buy them back.  Killing me how much money I am leaving on the table.... if I would have bought them back end of yesterday I would be $31.5 richer (after already loosing out on $39k).  It is mooning after hours now even more.  Only redeeming grace is I do have a bunch of calls that I am holding onto worth about $100k not including after hours. Would this be considered gain points and loss porn at the same time?

lmao. what a useless retard.
what is this sorry?
you are always persuading me to buy things - which is why i asked lol
Congratulations! I know more and more people are getting into this and you started out with a decent amount that you seemed like you could afford to lose. I think that's a great way to start and have a safe environment when you do so!

You should note that it's always better to close your positions before expiration so you're not at the mercy of your brokerage.  They will always do whatever is in their best interest, not yours.

They invent new enzymes through directed evolution (2018 Chemistry Nobel Prize). Pharma companies pay them royalties to use their platform, and when they invent a new enzyme (takes about three days to do a billion years of evolution) they get to share patent rights. A really remarkable business model with high profile pharma companies (Merck, Novartis, etc...) licensing their tech. Don't be fooled by their website, environmentalism is not the point here, just a small fringe benefit.  


Fuck the DD though. Basically you can get rich by buying a stock that proves evolution exists. So next time your shitty uncle gets you upset saying evolution isn't real, dry your tears with sweet sweet tendies.

If they try to take anything from us, they better start with wealthy, well connected individuals first, this would also include political figures. Look at what Burr did, I’m mean come on. Just think of all the backdoor government deals being cut for tax payer money, think multi billion.

43.
Just take the gains you have locked in and move on. I don’t sell CCs on men stock like GME anymore for this very reason.
I’d suspect only <10% of total shorts have covered. No way the big boys have started covering yet. I’m sure they’re using every last ditch effort/tactic to survive. 

Plenty of room to fly.
Mmm... Melvin?
keep those hands away from the sell button and we're golden

Of course there are more ICE cars involved in accidents, there aren’t that many Tesla’s on the road in comparison!! It’s idiotic to make that argument when you aren’t considering the percentage ratios.
SNAP here in AH $$
I repent
In this market... I personally am not betting against anything
Either buy at open, or pray there’s a dip to hop into. Or just buy at whatever and trust that RC and the Fellowship of the Short Squeeze can bring it to Pluto 🚀💎🤚. If everyone buys up shares and holds the ceiling doesn’t exist.
Anyone think that GME is a safe buy?   Just turned 14 and got a RH account through my older sister in her name with $300 bucks.  ty.

"Data analysts" will just become generic STEM people, including those currently in marketing or business development.

My prediction is that it will stop being a technical role. 

I don't think full automation of analytics is possible, but the cost can be lowered significantly.

Imagine all the analytics work that is being done at Amazon last mile logistics optimization, Uber ride optimization, Lime scooter placement optimization, Doordash delivery optimization.

All of these companies are fighting over top analyst talent to build out the geospatial optimization logic, INDEPENDENTLY. Imagine if one company that was able to share best practices between all of these organizations. They could do BETTER and CHEAPER.

Always take profits. Buy again if it dips

It’s easy to make gains during a bull market, just warning you
Anything is better than a short squeeze for them. I’m trying to reconcile the 50$ calls and stuff , this might just be part 2 of the same thing
The exchange is the controller, yes. But this is only because the default controller would be the manager/creator/minter of the currency however since BTC is decentralized there is no way to moderate any policies or core functionality of BTC, making the next point of control the exchanges which I mentioned later in the comment. 

I addressed your point earlier on re: forcing exchanges to do X, it ultimately is skirted without much effort by foreign operated exchanges that suffer no consequence to allowing US users to break their own laws and exchanges that exist entirely decentralized, much like BTC.
BBBY has a major short squeeze coming!!!
GME those BB gainz BB
I have been doing that for a long time, yes.

The squeeze is just getting started. Definitely wait for margin calls to hit at the very least

Going to cash out my 1/15 BBBY calls when it hits 30 tomorrow and then throw it all into something else that’s fucking retarded. That’s my move tomorrow.

How do you have to cover selling a put? I've seen this twice on here.

If you sell a put you collect premium. The price goes up so you keep the premium and don't have to buy the shares.

The fact you have upvotes must mean I'm completely wrong about something or WSB is actually full of people that don't know basic options

Nothing to say at this point but lol
Hahahaha BB!
I'm not arguing that it's profitable right now. Also, apologies on me saying Blue Origin, I meant Boeing.

It's called investing in the future. Those who have the way now have claim to everything in the future. These companies will be the only ones capable of accessing literally everything beyond Earth. Your view is too shortsighted. Just because they won't make profit this year, doesn't mean they don't make profit within 20 years. Their value will skyrocket within 20 years and those who got in early will reap the rewards like the internet boom.

Believe what you want, I'm in the industry myself and was skeptical at first, but I know the countless ways that space companies can make money. Hundreds of millions alone are poured into space just for FARMERS to get pictures of their crops and farm land. That's just one of thousands of uses for satellites and space technology. Keep being pessimistic, but stop pretending their isn't value. If there wasn't value we wouldn't be pouring in billions. Rich people don't spend their money because they like eating money, they do it because they want to make more money and it may be long-term, but it will pay off and even more for the people that don't have to put in the upfront cost but can get in early and reap the rewards later.

I haven’t read it, but if you check it out you will notice that there are indeed a lot of words.
45k sell wall. Already kicked in the 100k wall at 40 lol
Hold until earnings, sell half, let the rest run.
That's how I'm going to raise my children, good job! 🚀🚀
Shares plus 1/15 55c and 1/22 55c
When did you sell for this 50% profit though?  If you did it this week then good on you.   If you did it in April 2020 after the low of March an then sold and missed out on the massive run up then well that is a different thing.   I always wonder when people who did own, sell, and then miss out on a run up if they are more apt to be irrationally negative.   It is something that I have seen quite a bit over the years.    People want to justify their own moves.   If they sell and find out they missed out on a bunch of upside I have seen people get pretty nasty about the company they used to own and like.    They tell themselves it is a bubble or make other excuses.  Not saying that you are like this.   Just something that I have observed.
Oh I see, so you were selling a call option while holding the underlying asset, that it? Good profit anyways man GG
What's in it for me?
What is this? This isnt robinhood?
Guys how do sell walls work during ah? Do they still trigger or do they trigger at open?
who shops at gamestop
Dark theme at night would be highly appreciated
Back from my witch hunt, totally a hoax ban
Meanwhile I've made 30 bucks in a month with $120 put in
I think it is indiscriminate. People are starving for assets to avoid dollar depreciation. People are buying despite stupid p/e because what else will they do? 

It's gonna correct, but when? Falling knives and all that.
Yes
Up 15% ah
Get outta here bot
I stopped reading after woman’s intuition
Melvin is unloading their shorts AH?
GME 43 after hours just got me to 10 Gs
If you are not in ARKG, you're doing something wrong bro. Genes to the fucking moon  🚀🚀🚀
About 19k USD. Im not fucking with options anymore. Only stonks.
nobody knows. probably shorts covering
what is this clip from?
It’s 7 percent as of the post your talking about. I forgot the post and calculations
THIS PIRCE ACTIONS GOT ME NUTTING
When it’s obvious we usually get a red dildo up our asses
I now have enough to buy a PS5 with my $100 investment. I just may buy it from gamestop. Thanks gamestop and capitalism!
Shes a babe. But you are right about her nose
Blackrock needs to rebalance. Too much plug
I was born in the right household. It's not a merit. But yeah, my chilhood was ez mode.
Hahaha literally has no idea I was up this much I was playing 2k cuz I’m autistic
So, since the highest strike call for tomorrow is at USD 40... if we keep this price level does that mean that every single open call for tomorrow will get exercised?
Is there a chance GME dilutes some if it’s shares because of this run up?
GET WEBULL FAM
Hey is LGO and LGORF same company?
Idk economics. But yes cost go up while consumer spending should go up too
Who will break $100 first? GME or AMD lol
How did you borrow from 401k?
Buy shares
If BB is a  software company and PLTR is also a  software company the price target for BB should be at least 25$

Trust me im an analyst (and kinda retarded)
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 tomorrow
Is it too late for BB or GME. Never done this before. Tell me what to do boys.
have you seen the wide variety of topics these stimulus bills have been addressing?
Pretty much, yes.
So what car y’all fucktards buying tmrw?
the MEN on this sub
Sooooo how’s GME
Plus stimmy news just hit. I'm buying more calls at open. This thing is gone.
There is a cash collateral for the value of security sitting in the lending account so for whatever reason they cannot, I would assume I would get the cash. It never happened though.
serious answer: If the buyout is an all-cash deal, shares of your stock will disappear from your portfolio at some point following the deal's official closing date and be replaced by the cash value of the shares specified in the buyout. If it is an all-stock deal, the shares will be replaced by shares of the company doing the buying.
Well I’m sending him pictures of my asshole then just to let him know it can be his

What's your pt for X?
Dumb or not people are doing it. That was my point.
I feel like AMC could be insane if they don't get bankrupt. But the timing might be hard to get down.
GME to $90? crazier things have happened..
Buy with limit orders or this will happen
This is one of those “going to get worse before it gets better” scenarios. It will get worse one of two ways - 1. You don’t make a new account and continue with the anxiety of having your mother watch your every financial move until you do at which point 2. You get fed up and make your own account which she will eventually figure out and freak out about. Basically this only ends in her finding out, you’re just choosing now or later. You could talk to her about it and work out some sort of system where you essentially keep the joint as a savings with a financial cushion and then operate daily out of your sole ownership account. 

I’m sorry to say though that you’re eventually going to have to stop letting her “insist” on things in your life. As long as you keep her in the loop and act like an adult about it, things may actually be fine, if not a bit uncomfortable for a while.
Haha yeah. Either way tendies for us amirite. All about knowing when exactly that perfect top is before the squeeze is over. Thanks for the info.
Big Bags
When is lockup over? I'll buy whatever is getting dumped. I need 450 more shares to hit my goal of 1000 for the year. If I can get in under 20 again I'd be so happy, and I'd probably double up to 2000 by eoy
Really hoping BYND gives another good run tomorrow
GREAT IDEA! Thanks!
Yo. I struggled to break my ATH of 67% and now in AH I’m over 100% all-time.

Shout out to WSB and fuck Melvin (boomer ass name anyway) all my homies hate Melvin.
GM is to boomer, it'll be CCIV  with the Lucid merger.
It's one of the great long term stocks. The crashes are when you reinvest dividends back into the company. When the stock is expensive you put the dividend income to work in other stocks.
If they’re smart
Where can I cashout my 200 Fitbit shares?
Was skeptical about GME and lost out.

30k on BB let’s fucking goooooooooooooo.
Battery Day...
I'll close my 1/15's fairly quick as I imagine the iv will swoon again. Shares I'll keep for next week
I got the ebook since I fall asleep reading. Its like 8 hours so a couple rogan podcasts worth. But its the best thing I've ever done for my trading. Let me know if you follow through and what you think.
FUCKING GME AHHHHHHHHHHHHH 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
my call expires tomorrow home boy
Robin
Another day, another Mill.
I liked what he said until I didn't like what he said anymore.
Lol
Probably because those cars are never actually “dirty”
If you’re expecting a dip, just keep some extra cash to buy low
What do I do with my 36$ shares
Great summary as always! Adding something else from today - LMND Lemonade after showing weakness yesterday has been targeted by Citron this afternoon and stock tanked hard after the announcement.
 [https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix)

DIX: 45.5% -> 46.3% -> 44.0%

GEX: 22.4B -> 6.32B -> 5.89B
$1.9 trillion dollar Gamestop gift card stimulus for those out of work.
Hey market, if you can just keep doing what you’ve been doing for the last 9 months that would be grrrreat.
GME $43 wall is gone!
LMAO who paperhanded GME????
EVERYBODY PUT YO SHIT TOGETHER AND KEEP BUYING GME!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
BB!
\>Unemployment is heavily concentrated in socioeconomic demographics that don't contribute heavily to much of corporate profits

And yet those neighborhoods are replete with iphones, Walmart products, empty fast food wrappers, comcast invoices and gas from exxon and chevron. I don't think his PhD is from an accredited university.
Okay now I think it has to do with everyone banning trump and it sets a “dangerous precedent” snap took a big dive too.... I’m playing fb into earnings for sure
BB to the moon gang 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Wait why is that
Any thoughts on GHIV currently bagholding til merger vote, hopefully PSTH hast popped by then.
For real? That's fucked. I don't want google to have my workout and sleep data.
This is what I got from raiding news articles and press releases. Their tech is supposed to be better than competition and deliver better taste. Hence why they got the grant and the patents. Single use plastics are coming to an end in Canada. We already seeing it in grocery stores on East coast and Ontario. The ceo seems to be very optimistic they can get box retail.
Is tomorrow gonna be the day of absolute madness?
Nice. I finally recouped my losses from last month with this little guy. Lots of room to grow with this one especially with a blue senate. LFG!
im the only data point i have. I don't know if theres a way to see how many people traded the same asset twice. Probably a breach of privacy.
Last time we had short squeezes like this was last June and we crashed pretty hard
Damn weed stonks are soaring?!!..i would never invested in weed. Got burn too many times
Take it as the final sign to join GME gang 🤚 we accept anyone who doesn’t short gme or Ryan Cohen. To infinity and beyond 🚀
How can we do after hours options trading?
Weaponized autism
Prolly some short covering but no one selling
AINT SELLING UNTIL SHORTS COVER. BLOOD IS IN THE WATER.
I own short-term puts. I don't want long term puts because I'm not long-term bearish.
Autists who have acces to AH buy more gme
There was a 95k at 40 that got blown up.
Buy more GME
So does everyone think the market will open up tomorrow or down? 
I basically have no downside protection
Robinhood
Y’all are welcome for the GME boost, I bought a PS4 gift card yesterday🚀
you got that F U Money now?
This AH GME action has got to be shorts covering and reselling to other shorts. There’s no other explanation lol
It's time to start using a bank account for gain or losses, so I know how to stop it.

Short SPY and long volatility tomorrow. Thank me later

TLDR wholesale price on the exchange was down to 0.18 yen per kWh when the weather was nice back in November 2020. Demand for electricity used for heating and air conditioning was low.  Solar generation was high.  

Compared to the current situation, the market demand, price for LNG, and renewable output are very volatile in Japan.
Buy calls.
As a holder of 100 $4 NOK 2023 LEAPS. Its the float that worries me. It takes a true force of retard strength to move 5 Billy shares
Look how fast everything came back from March (most things). Amazing companies (for no reason at all other than fear) were at HUGE discounts. It depends on your risk tolerance and if you trust your research. If there is a crash I'll be moving some cash around to get the companies I believe in at a discount. But who knows if/when a crash will happen, if you have done your research you should be able to sleep easy... If you haven't, I suggest starting now and then making your decision.
You are doing more in one day with one of your two lines than I'll do in a life!
GME giveth
Ah fuck. Did he sell his 1/15C today? I was DFV handsing mine until he sold. Shit hahaha
It almost doesn’t feel real
Why am I so scared of a selloff tomorrow, continuing into next week? Was this week a false breakout? Will the Biden speech(es) be a sell the news event? Are the MMs going to drop the bag on retail? *is* a blue wave bullish? This feels awfully similar to the Labor Day correction.... might sell everything tomorrow morning. Oh shit I almost forgot - GME 🚀🚀
See [my other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/kxfac0/debt_at_chinas_stateowned_firms_in_spotlight_as/gj9x5wc/).
Edit: 5k into that 100c shak woudve been over $750k

I chose wrong and lost it all, onto next week boys 👌🏼
Are my 1/22 50c going to be ITM tomorrow? I hope so.
This is often followed by you trying to convince yourself that you made the right decision because... risk management (meanwhile the YOLO play you bought into instead crashes and burns)
SPY flat for 5 days in a row, wtf is going on
I bet more than 8
I mean you’re right because I don’t really short cuz I’m not a gay 🐻
Holding FCEL while my brothers fight on the GME BB front. Im fucking mentally deficient
we will have 1.9 million subs by market close tomorrow.
NO SIR, GME TO 60
Hitting 45 after hours seems plausible
This is the funniest fucking thing I've seen all week. I'm crying!
So much 💦💦💦🚀🚀🚀 I feel like part of a family with you motherfuckers holding these shares. Literally my first trade ever 😂

Strikes up to 55 were available at open.
Mooning AH
BUY MORE GME
There's puts closed at .08 a contract. Lmao
4. You still need to buy a house?

5. You have next to your stick portfolio other cash available?
When GME is fully bought, it’s then mexicain standoff between holders until one sell triggering a collapse?
victory isnt guaranteed, dont be afraid to claim profits commensurate to the risk youve undertaken.
So I am not sure the tax rules of other countries ; in the USA dividends are taxable.

Other countries have different rules so I have not clue about how the taxes work in Switzerland

Oh. My. God. GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
But be aware that if a stock really plummets ur trailing stop loss may trigger but the price isnt guarnteed, your broker will fill it at the best available price. That could be lower then the price u set. Just depends on the buy and sell bids.
Can't believe I missed this 🙄
Holding BB till 69.
It honestly depends on the price, I would like for all of us to hold so the shorters get f\*cked as they will hold till the end possibly.
Look again now... afterburners just fired
U2
there are many GME threads
What happens if you do nothing and the contract reaches maturity date?
Just take a look as to why we are all saying “don’t sell” your GME. 

Nobody here needs the money soooo badly RIGHT now that you can’t wait a few more days to make a ton more.  

GME TO TRIPLE DIGITS!
I’ve only got 6 QQQJ June contracts cause damn those premiums move slow
Not enough AH volume
Lorie fo sure
I’m not too greedy, I just want GME to reach 50 and I’m good to go 🤗

You can buy either, after the merger you will get the same value in stock amount in tlry

Looks like Biden’s stimulus package provides $40 billion to clean energy.

“​With a $35 billion investment insuccessful state, local, tribal, and non-profit small business financing programs,Congress can generate as much as $175 billion in low-interest loans and venturecapital to help entrepreneurs -- including those in the clean energy sector -“

Exactly it’s too expensive so he can’t push renewable in this bill if he wants bipartisan support
If you head that way, just make sure you act like $2.50/month is a big deal. Otherwise they'll spot you.
Gotta wait for 2nd bill..
why BB though... :D i mean i fomoed in already with 600 € but if its serious i can fomo in much more\^\^
Dear lord, why am I such a pussy? Why did I only buy 10K worth of GME positions at close? Why did I not buy more 43 calls expiring tomorrow (only bought 5 and they're already ITM)? Oh well GME to the moon 🚀 🚀 🚀
GME teasing after hours. Will my 55c 1/15 print?
Sure they are. All are geared to provide income streams. Comparable, but not the same. If you look at most income funds, they are comprised of all 3. And many people buy bonds for diversification.
1/15 43c. Please save my portfolio
My head says it was good decision making pulling out of 1/15 GME at the high point but my heart says wow this rally makes me wish I didn't. Oh well still have shares and april calls
Damn I dumped my shares too early lol. Sold at around 8.8 to 9

Still have a handful of leaps tho
$VALE to moon in Feb. Cashin in my BB calls and buyin up those VALE tomorrow!!🚀🚀🚀🚀
I bought 200 shares and a call about a week ago let’s do this
It dropped into the 40's at one point and users here were commenting that he needs to pull out, he's going to lose his life savings, GME is going bankrupt.

He responded with sarcastic gifs

Look at it now, I swear he's a time traveller.
They're too embarrassed to admit it
The way of the autist.
If you invested 20 years ago you woulda lost most of your gains by now.  Its not a hold forever stock

Dear Oracle. What's your PT on PLTR.
🥺
This will be over a year at least. Possibly 3 or more
Just check the boxes and click the buttons.  Nothing to it.
Yeah, first big win in a while. Initial investment of 6k, pulled out 19k so far, with 30k still on the table. I want to hold but I've been down this road too many times at this point and know that parabolic gains usually lead to huge drops, hence my interest in hedging some of that risk. 

I might pick up some puts for next week too, but I think that if your thesis plays out then 0-day puts will hedge me better with less capital.
Idk if Apple is selling that stuff since I do have a Apple Watch but thought that was weird on my personal email.
that’s still not manipulation, that’s just a large ass sell order
yep... I just keep buying and selling.. for the stuff to always keep mooning. Was in since $6. In and out :( guh lol
How much volume in GME ah?
What does 44k sell wall mean?
Yo can I have some I need to fix my teeth
Cramer keeps trying to coax an offering from GME. Which side are you on, bro?! “There’s always a bull market somewhere, my job is to find it for you!”. We found it! Stay away!
Without limit order it can charge me more than the stock is worth??

It says my cost was $3.13 cad but the stock never has bit that price
I’m going allllllll in tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀🚀 not missing this shit
You son of a bitch, you sons of bitches really broke wall street. SEC is probably finding a way on how to break us up.
Just buy April calls. Ez.
500 more bucks to GME!!!
lets gooo NOK 🚀🚀🚀
12,000 shares of BB, I told you motherfuckers 😂
from shares? grzz
Yes.  

No clue which way.  Should have bought straddles.
people that own shares of gme write higher contracts to sell for premium tendies
Webbull
Hold until you're on the moon, and then hold a while longer!
We got like professional shills here pumping BB because they missed GME lmfao
BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
What ticker
It did not fill. Got moved up. Spoof alert
Guys and gals, I think we may have defeated Melvin. We are now over $43 AH. We could very well open tomorrow near 50
Lol
😏
Shorts maybe?

You could buy 32 shares of GME with that.
Also it has like three 5% days in a row. Today was 7.5%
I think you mean $69,420
Just buy $BB and *IMAGINE* 💕
A fraction of a share , which app you using that isn't robinhood?
actually lol'd when i refreshed and saw the GME AH price. moon mission, lets go
Considering the current economic situation - covid measures still being in place, FED printing money like crazy... I think that you can chill for at least one or 2 more years. When the printing stops, interest rates go up and reality sinks in, then it might be a good idea to sell.
Guys I have breaking news.

I just bit into a Lindt truffle and it had no filling.

Bear market confirmed.
I became a millionaire last year, but since it didn’t sneak up on me overnight it maybe wasn’t as exciting as one might’ve expect. Who am I kidding it’s the bees kneez
And GME giveth some more
What’s the current ATH?
The millionaire next door types aren't sitting with bmw 7 series in the drive, that's for sure

Theta for this option is like .039 where do you get off at spreading this misinformation?
GME ATH AH...no idea where this is gonna go tomorrow...
Don’t speak of such things
Boomer machines.
Why is it going to Rocket at open?
Theyre doing it. Almost at 43...
GME is teaching all paper handed cucks a lesson
Dude are you kidding me? Have I ever betrayed your trust?
I guess it was cool that The order to  sell 30 of them before close didn’t go through lol
Nope!
We already got the $600 last week.
Is this r stocks or wsb cause all these idiots sound autistic. There's nothing wrong with losing money. It happens. The people who shout "bull market, I dk fundamentals, etc but I made money" are not investors. They're gambling and unfortunately now is the time that gambling pays big, especially if you blindly buy calls and bet upwards. Now is not the time for investors, wait until the next correction (20-30%) and consider investing if other factors suggest it's time as well. Most of these idiots will be wiped out when a rug pull happens like in March and wsb goes on suicide watch because two red days wiped out 5 months of s&p gains.
500*
Or just FOMO from accounts trading in extended hours.
Dip hard next week, that's your entry
I wasn't even born at that time and now I'm flying to the moon.🚀🌝
Weed stocks. TLRY up 23.57%; APHA up 21.10% on surprise earnings beat (and also the first time in eons the stock hasn’t nosedived after ER), both are up currently AH. Major gains across the cannabis sector.
i bought gme 5 years ago and im finally 50% up. Thanks guys, was worth the wait
My boy used it. Was cool to have so much radio for hip hop to switch through and sounds fire.
I wish I could see the Ocugen chart, wonder how many bag holders are sitting there with me
Fitbit shareholders in shambles. Their money just vanished. 🪄
Fuck Melvin
Shit I hope we all make it man
The total of the new calls is 92k again
FB and BABA are literally too cheap rn 

If you have 10k just throw it in these leaps
55c 1/15's sold for .59 right before close. Is it better to sell at open or set a limit at something higher (or lower)? Bought at .35 earlier in the day to catch a spike but phone died for a few hours away from a charger and I missed the $2+ window.
ONLY bags GME folks gonna be holdin is a birkin 

Yktv
Why?
FOMO... cause we got the squeeeezee on our side. We then drop the bag onto Hedge Funds
Fuckin cramer
FYI $REAL has popped ~50% since this comment bro
DIX out for Harambe
You think the earnings are gonna be positive? I mean I'm probably gonna sell before anyways but will the price recover in time? The AMD options premiums are relatively cheap rn. I paperhanded my last AMD option though (1/22 92C) and ran off with a $25 profit.
Hit 55 and you can get a sick hotel
he sold them
As a caddy in high school I got to golf for free on Mondays when the club was closed. One of the best private golf courses in the country, and I never would have had the chance otherwise.
Uhhhh. I buy green and sell red. Am I doing it wrong?
why would he ever exercise them if he could just sell the calls and buy the stock and keep the option premium?
He'll probably say ACES just out of old man habit, and we'll all be ironically fucked 

Like... "That's just ACES!"
You missed GME didn’t you?
Thoughts on WOOF and PLUG tomorrow?
Don’t get distracted autists, BB is our next moon mission 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀=>🌓
Most of these companies are r&d clean energy. If you really want to save the world just keep pumping ICLN and Plug like the rest of us idiots.
I bought at .23 so if it hits $3 I’d make $3900 out of $69 and immediately turn that $3900 into CCIV calls
*when you have .07 tesla stonks*
And there you have it folks. Jesus himself aka the one true king of WSB has spoken
Yeah that's the secret once you are awarded the contract and they're using your software makes it really hard to change the future without a complete rework
Oops, my mistake
Not like some of you whales, but life changing. Student loans gone...
If overthinking was a post
Very nice.
This isn't correct. You can exercise options on margin and sell instantly. You might have to call your broker to handle that transaction but you don't need the cash to exercise if you don't use a shit broker. 

I have exercised 500k+ in Tesla calls overnight before
gratz!
BB conference better be electric tomorrow
Let’s gooooooo
Queen of WSB in the making  🚀🚀🚀
Smoking that fucking Melvin pack
Friendly reminder for tomorrow. Dont be a paper-handed bitch

My full-time job is just a side hustle at this point. I just made enough to pay rent while sleeping in this morning. Showed up to work 2 hours late and clocked in 8 an 8 hour shift before leaving early.
Are we supposed to hold gme for tmro? New to this lol
I think the most important not that how much or he could just put in an index. He learned in the process, researched, watch YouTube that my friend more value than your $100 which is a bonus. Keep educating yourself
Epic.
the original question is literally about retired people
43.00
Long Live BB
Will it dip? Absolutely, at market open when all the Melvin boomers (and paper hands panic) so they can cover their puts for a bit cheaper. But once they start covering it will skyrocket like how Tesla would jump up in the final hours of trading
hold through the weekend 🚀🚀🚀
I’ll see you at ~29$ at open lol
This has to be one of the more cringeworthy attempts at a mental flex I've seen on here...
yeah but they need to be available. im trying to research his question right now. I think SEC decides but i need to confirm.
GME is going to start an insurrection here when it comes time to sell
this is the way
Seriously though I think it was an all cash offer for like $7.35 a share.. so you’ll probably get that per share
the stonk market
I‘m in with view hundred stocks / Entry at 16,23$ so well in the Green ☘️ But my Question is can someone give me advice for a save call option on GME what I can add tomorrow? I‘m not so into Option trading but this stock would be a great first timer... so I’m greatfull for advice 🙏
Wait blackberry still exists
ARKG Calls gonna print heavily tomorrow.
I am rock hard right now
Anyone else glued to this thread due to GME 🚀 craziness?
It’s about to blow up. You haven’t missed it
That GME yolo deserves every penny. Diamond handed through the worst pandemic in modern history, didn't sell yesterday and held on till the very last minute. 

LEGEND
Blackberry? More like BlackBURYmydickinallthesegains!! 

I UPGRADE $BB WITH A $300 PT
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Almost all ETFs I looked at lept AH. Don’t know why but that’s ok with me
Lol fomoed into gme at 42.9$ and bought 2 50c 1/15 those might actually print ey?
But then no gas for the lambos :(
If GME gaps up another 20% tomorrow morning, I think the shorts will start to get very scared and we will start to see the squeeze really kick in.
Where are you watching?
Accidentally gave 2 gold, am i retarded enough for this sub yet?
I’ve been sitting a little below 10g’s for a few days now. Every day I think “Today’s the day!” But it hasn’t happened yet. Maybe tomorrow
Savage - might try your style tomorrow
In for 2000 shares. I was expecting things to pop today with the stimulus announcement, now I just feel retardrd.
HYSR be looking juicy. Put 15k in and I’m up 61% 🥰
I still have a couple 42c's expiring next week though
GME $43.00 post market
And I you, my little dust ball.
I think you could get an estimate on [optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://optionsprofitcalculator.com) by putting in the AH share price but it won't be 100% accurate
to the FUCKING moon baby
Hyberbolic Tan is a stock?
Even if you’re scared to buy options, you have no excuse for not buying gme shares while in the midst of a short squeeze. Yeah I’m taking to you
I sold 60 to cover day trade margin Bought back in, forgive me father for I have sinned
Uranium, steel, weed, solar, wind, military will all benefit imo
Someone turn this into a movie. Most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Why? Not in the US?
Too bad he sold 2/3 of his position in 2020 during the run up
Please never post that horrible video again. 

I'm cool with BB tho!!
 Codexis CDXS

Call 3/19 @ 26.00

They invent new enzymes through directed evolution (2018 Chemistry Nobel Prize). Pharma companies pay them royalties to use their platform, and when they invent a new enzyme (takes about three days to do a billion years of evolution) they get to share patent rights. A really remarkable business model with high profile pharma companies (Merck, Novartis, etc...) licensing their tech. Don't be fooled by their website, environmentalism is not the point here, just a small fringe benefit.

Fuck the DD though. Basically you can get rich by buying a stock that proves evolution exists. So next time your shitty uncle gets you upset saying evolution isn't real, dry your tears with sweet sweet tendies.

All of my holdings are in the stock and I have calls expiring in March so obviously I'm just a dumb fucking shill trying to pump my own shit.
Long weed
Yes
Please see wiggz if I am wrong about this!
What’s the PT on BB?
We should lock our subreddit
Not too late. Squeeze just getting started on both. It will take a while for shorts to fully cover
It just started today you didn’t miss anything I’m getting in tomorrow!
What about Xiaomi, made a 13% loss today?
im actually so surprised you morons pulled this off fuck melvin hes a fuckin nerd
That first question was a freebie. Further questions contribute to my stocks. (You can easily Google the answer to your question about net gains and taxes for 2021.)
Negative subscriber growth is going to be real and it’s going to crush this stock.  They might need to start charging a fee for use of their left wing echo chamber.
I at least generally know what I'm doing most of the time but I have no Idea when I should get out of this position.

Will you pleas GOD tell us when you think it's time to exit and give us a heads up?
Anyone else riding CIIG?  +11% today. Merging Q1
GME, BBBY, and BB are all mooning lmaooo, it feels like 2003 out here.
We don’t talk about that lol
What % gain do u close out at

TYFYS
makes sense. BB 25 EOM
Next week $VALE looking nice
Did so in December for BABA. Working out pretty well so far.
What is their product exactly?
#FCKMLVN💩
Amen brother, sold immediately this morning an transfered to bb an gme. Thank god
Yes, hold and watch the ticker!
“The autists who broke Wall Street”
Trying to spook folks into selling probably. 

We. Aint. Fucking. Selling.
GME share dilution might be off the table now that Mr. Chewy is on the ship. Why would he dilute himself
If it reaches 100 lmao I’m going to bust the largest nut 😂💦💦💦
Dude how the fuck are you down on ICLN ? Did you buy for the first time last week or something because the week chart is the only one that’s red
Bout to?
Ah, nice!  That's unusual, and I hope it's well-managed.  In that situation, I wouldn't count it towards FI until I got closer and knew that I'd be able to collect.
Fun hobbies that produce cash at your own leisure is always the way to go for OPs idea imo.
Retailers always find a way to profit, less stores, probably a shift onto their online sales
 $BB Gang!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
What makes you think the new administration will continue down this path?
If you go back to the trade options page, to the left of the dates you should see a tab that says "Discover"


I recommend clicking that and reading through the Robinhood info they provide on that page and then watching a few Youtube videos.


I've read countless reddit posts/comments about options trading but what really helped me was seeing others do it via a video and then making some low risk ones myself.
keep holding it to at least 100
Fr. We just gettin starting tho
Actually, if I find some old notes from when I learned from this or something it might be fun to do a couple case studies for new folks.

Like here is where that stock was first mentioned, here is the catalyst, here is when it was actually upvoted at all, here's the hype, here's the news, here the most people own it and continue to as the price goes in the gutter...
GME hitting 50 tomorrow ong
Yessir
Weedstocks to look at: WMD, TLRY, CURA, APHA!!
I feel like the outcast kid at the party sitting in a corner alone, drinking my PLTR, while every kid is busting it to the GME beats and having fun.
when does the next president speak?
You bought $40 calls after the stock doubled in two days? It looks like it’s doing good post market but that doesn’t mean shit. Assuming it doesn’t dip tomorrow, I’d sell them ASAP before they expire worthless
How can someone own the broker money? You buy the call and pay beforehand right? Worst case its all gone, right?
anyone got a link to the interview?
Sure did, choo choo!!
Portfolio diversity: 100% 😂😂😂
GME making moves. Remember DON'T SELL. HOLD.
Discloser: 3769 shares at $32.6. Would have bought more but I literally can't (company's trading window is closed for a few more weeks and that's where most of my money is).
What yall think about FIVRR?
👊
Make GMGI the next GME
same as yesterday around 200k
How much am I gonna make from my $10.5 feb 5 BB calls tomorrow? 1000% 😂?
Thanks, I see it now. I think I last checked yesterday and 40 was the max strike. It does look that OI on the higher strike calls (above 40) is basically nonexistent.
Whooo!

Who do we attack next!
Should we seriously still be buying at $42?
Holy shit BB was the play of the day?

Also, can’t wait to get my hands on the Nintendo wii you guys!
hahah thanks. the dream is 2 mil in a 2.5% aristocrat portofoilo. easy life after that.
Why isn't the story ever "We fucked up and missed this great investment."?
How the fuck are shorts not completely out of GME yet. Talk about fucking 💎 🤚
Burrrrrrrnnnnnn
NKLA
$1400 stimmy declared. We are all going to be riiiich. Buy all the calls 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Fucking robin hoods deposit limit screwed me. I would've dumped so much more into bb and gme today
It worked 💯
Its a very good time
Yeah if you are intending to sell the shares, you can also consider “sell to close” the option itself. If you are in the money, meaning you are set to make a profit, the value of the option will increase in value.

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/sell-open-buy-close-buy-open-sell-close-mean/
DONT SELL GME!! KEEP BUYING SHARES AND CALLS AND WE WILL SEE 50 TOMORROW
Don't fucking pay taxes then dumbass. Just sleep for a whole year smh
good luck... to both of us

&#x200B;

i may join you long if it plays out and pukes tomorrow.
GET READY TO SUCK MY COCK MELVIN
People who’re getting forced to
GME AFTER HOURS XXX 🚀🚀🚀🚀💦💦💦🍆🍆
Thanks for your input! Truly appreciated
Definitely
Why
Not a chance. There was a stupid amount of short the last 2 days. Very little unwinding.
That's great, I'll look further into them, appreciate the detailed info. 👍

Thanks!
Yeah but DFV took Burry's position after it was public knowledge.
I finally understand what you meant the whole time.  Thanks for the effort, appreciated.  

Them Feb 55c are looking real cheap right now. Yum.

I was looking just now, I’m short a 19 put expiring tomorrow, 😂
Dad!! The DNA results are in.
GME 420 BB 69
correct every 3 months then blast off again?
hey that's my grandfather's name please respec
I got burned today, going to ponder over how to next proceed.

It's a learning experience though, hopefully I'll do better next time.
It's been a bull run for a bit. Hard times are ahead at some point; I just can't see it at the moment, especially with Dems in the WH and House. Country about to take on even more debt but that's a longterm issue. 

Before you get some misconceptions though. Retirement isn't necessarily financial independence. But it's a big enough cushion were you can stand up at work, tell your boss to fuck off, then walk out. 

It's also the ability to work doing something you enjoy without doing it solely for the paycheck.
Would love to see this too
Honestly, I think I'll take profits and put em into BB and APHA
The whole, ‘I had it hard so others should too,’ attitude sucks. If I can stop a fellow investor from falling into a loss because I already learned the lesson, why wouldn’t I help unless I was just generally bitter?
I’m with you
Paper handed bitches deserve it. 45 open tomorrow
They seem risk averse, yet never cut a good profit when they can. I don't really understand their thinking and it seems like a lot of them don't into stonks either.
No shame, that theta on a 1dte is horrific
7pm est
🌈🐻 in shambles
This is all I can afford for... Now! Once it's moon I will be able to join future gains!
Mods aint great here. Most were for silly things. Talked about a magic mushroom pharma stock on the OTCs by name. Talked about president's economic plans b4 election (never said who to vote for) and experts opinions on the plans. Posted a picture someone made of mango and putin kissing. And then talked abput drama from another sub +prob the only thing I think that might deserve a ban)
Yes
Looking good on GME and BB after hours
I like your energy
600 + 1400 = 2000
BB 🚀🚀🚀
Post market lol
WSB made it onto wallstreet journal we did it guys
There is going to be at least one red or flat day for GME. Their last ER says they filed for the option to sell $100MM worth of shares at some point and they will want their bonuses.
idk not sure if we should be on board with personal harassment

GME would be stupid not to raise some cash right now.
I think moon tomorrow sell off Monday but what do I know
Thanks brosef
Who is on the CBBT🚀 with me?
it could, but it would be bullish. It would drive the Bankrupt Thesis to 0
Got some zoom Lottos just in case Biden talks about lockdowns
>anyone was counting on this in the later years

No; we don't include it in any projections so it'll ideally serve as that buffer for us as well.
PLUG pleas fly again to 74
Anyone want to pump HUYA with me?
Value, FB/CRM pick one
for all the EV hype and other meme stonk gains that were missed for GME shareholders and call holders, GME is now compensating all of us for the wait we had
BB still worth? someone tell me stat so i can get in lmao
GME to infinity then?
Vote to keep this shit, we need some BDE around here 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 

Get fucked Melvin!
APHA 🚀🚀🚀
Bought 1400 gme shares today and dumped them after hours for a 21% gain lol
Lol @ WSB shitting out viral meme stocks on a daily basis that defy logic and befuddle analysts. Thanks JPow 😎🍸
I think it’s kinda part of the definition of a short squeeze that it crashes after, just gotta enjoy it while it lasts
GME u get your ass back to 43 so u can open at $55 for papa tomorrow

Lol ur just an autist. These aren’t shorts covering these are people buying in afterhours if you weren’t retarded you’d understand that’s bullish
smart move tbh
Yes 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I’d buy if my puts ever got assigned, but I’m not complaining. A gain is a gain.
Havent listened yet... but I can’t fucking wait . Lol
When I've tried this in the past, I end up forgoing 60% gains to avoid 20% losses.
The Bond movie was supposed to come out in the Spring of last year, then was moved to November, then was moved to April 2021 and now looks to be moving to November 2021. Movie theaters may get through this, but business in gradual decline imo.  If things don't get better by the Spring and Fast and the Furious and everything else has to get moved *again*, then the theater companies are going to have to face some major problems.
I was extra retarded and bought 38C on the dip just before market close.  In retrospect, a terrible decision, but it might pay off
Bought calls expiring right after earning for the sole purpose of selling on the run up. Same with MSFT and WMT
🤝
YOLO 500 more into GME?
Hmm. I did actually go there last week for the first time in over a year to buy a controller.

Ended up walking out cause 2 retard husband and wife from backwoods Arkansas couldn't remember their phone number and were taking 20 minutes, all while shit talking the last guy that had tried to help them.

I dont have that kind of patience
because its easier to buy shares when they cover
this is sick and all but I keep thinking about how jpow literally shut down the idea of raising interest rates anytime soon earlier today

then he said who gives a fuck about inflation

lmao printers go brrrr
Its definitely going to 50$ tomorrow because I sold fds for a little theta action 🤡
Has the GME squeeze squozen?
Same here, I know east transfers. But the fees and software is ruining me. 2k+ down the drain in just a couple months guh.
this is the greatest play in the history of plays
Sure but I am new also so this will be good.  

$9 is the strike price which means I am buying the right to buy those shares at $9 should the option expire ITM (In The Money).  

2/12 is the expiration date of the contract which means we want to be ITM at that time and either sell before then or exercise (purchase) the shares.
BB at open tmr ? or too late
buy high sell low, you’re doing fine
I'll take one from the company in the movie 'Moon'
Can this be done using a Questrade trading account?
http://imgur.com/a/wYOuqR8

Are these calls gonna print tmrw
So you decide to go all in on a meme stock in option....
My company cancelled raises this year (I got one because I’m that good). Then we had our annual end of the year “luncheon” and they keep going on and on about how great we’re doing this year despite the pandemic.

Absolute cunts. They’re just using COVID as an excuse not to pay us.
Cant go tits up. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Thats when I entered, I remember it popped back up to 8 or so briefly between all the halts, I added more through May/June once it resumed for 10002 shares at 2.71 avg,. Im holding long, def a big yolo position for me.
15$ minimum wage? How is McDonald’s suppose to keep my breakfast burritos cheap?
Total agree on GRWG. See why it’s going to 💥 https://link.medium.com/uUKwDWW92cb
I get what you mean.

Some amazing long term stocks to get in right now.
And you wouldn't have to do anything..
But day trading and seeing them gains straight away.

And theres some huge gains to be made sometimes very quickly
probably what I will be doing now.....just bought 100 at 10.52 after hours, already down
Where is the tard that said he’d tattoo his ass if GME opened at 50$?!

Ban for one year if GME reaches 150$
GME is a beast
vale bros, we reached 19
7est i think
Got it boss
Jumped in $300 BB 10$ C 3/19 and $600 worth of 1/29 PLTR 25C. So far 1/2.
PRCH way underpriced IMO. Porch. Com

Great name and has actual revenue. Market cap only 1 billion. 

This was a SPAC

up 70 percent already. Could easily go double again.
$BB if you’ve already rode GME
I'm all in! 

Uh, how big of a pack should I grab and do you recommend going cans or bottles?
We jackoff in the moon tomorrow. Then on to Jupiter to reclaim our girlfriends
Caught implies we did something wrong. SEC needs to go after all those naked short sellers.
International*
Gme or bb?
Looks like those are shares he sold short. 47k. If on margin, he could owe
A 40yo was 20 in 2000. A boomer was 20 in 1970. There's a huge tech difference in that 30 years, I don't think the two generations can be combined.
Ban
He’s also the Dude that shut RH tf down with their exploitable loophole last year
They aren't being saved. They are switching their entire company to be a software (to include cybersecurity company) which drastically changes their valuation. Also, they're partnered with Amazon now too.
I opened up a $10 1/22 call 6 hours ago thinking I would miss the boat and it's up 200% already
And where tlry ends up
i yolo’d 10 contracts of 3/19 $15c today because of the hype. love u boys
too late to get in?
If they have something big planned and  no cash to fund it, they will have to sell shares. And since the stock has fucking tripled it'd be pretty dumb for them not to

I'm doing him a favor
Why am I in this shitty fucking IPOE. Fuck you chamath
if you think about, it's kinda insane how GME hasn't had an offering yet... it's almost like they don't want to raise cash and expand lmao. Then again, it might be vested interest as RC has like 20% of GME and is on the board
TSLA pleas fly again tomorrow
I just went in @9. May dump in another 100 shares to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
bruh like 90% of the shorts are not covered rn
Instructions unclear, yoloed my whole account into TANH
My god. Got in with about 40 shares today. Y’all think long calls are still viable at this point 😂? No way I’m shorting this with the iv what it is.
What happened
It won’t let me share the link from rh prob Bc they generally charge. If you have a rh account it’s an article listed under gme
They both gonna go parabolic tomorrow
Priced in
how high do you think it will go?
Don’t say that then it’ll drop down to 20
...?
$MT im thinking 6/18 $28c
Yes and you’d have to **try** to have not gotten lucky this past year, that’s the point lol
He shouldn’t be investing wow
Not saying it won’t boom but it’s not very scalable.
what calls to buy tomorrow - BB calls??
I mean who can fucking argue with results
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
GME giveth and GME takes :( hopefully it giveth more
Somebody has an order to sell 44k shares at 43. So at least 44k+1 shares need to be purchased at 43 for it to go higher. It’s often done in an effort to keep the price down (or up with a buy wall)
Just followed you. Congrats by the way. Now kiss me.
There are a million of these stories, you just have to move on.  I have a hundred of them myself.
Both
I gotta sleep on my back otherwise this GME 🚀🚀 is gonna get in the way
I work in the automotive sensor market = directly with multiple large OEMS.

I see nothing unique OR valuable Blackerry/AWS is offering.

OEM's have already begun heavily investing in these type of sensor information interfaces.

That being said, I just purchased 200 shares.
It’s being pinned to 380. Maximum pain. Lots of contracts expire tomorrow
OMG, I did not realize until now that making funds go under was on my bucketlist. GME!
You put the buy order on the 5th in the screenshot? It probably went through at the time but for whatever reason didn't show up til 7th- sorry, not familiar with the platform you're using.

On the 5th;
[](https://i.imgur.com/uYev4kE.png)
The classic of sell low and buy high. Oof
honestly might be 50 at pre-market opening tomorrow
Both wtf
The shorts covering after hours for when it pumps the next day, thats when they sell and you see the dips then midday they rinse and repeat.
Thanks! this is awesome and I made a move in part based on this this week.  Could we get constant posts on this? There's so much to keep track of and the vast majority of us are not full time traders.  But if we all did like 1 hour of DD a week like this together we'd crush it
How do I invest right now. Won't I have to wait to transfer from my bank to an account. Will it be too late
...scrolling lyrics would help. 

but if this is conformation bias, I approve.
Nope! Just a little pre-squeeze goin on right now...
GME join the cause
If this news is released tomorrow but we buy the stocks now in after hours, is this insider trading?
I start shorting after short squeezes. It's like buying after a crash.
I know we only have eyes for GME right now (and rightfully so) but ARKG SPCE and TLRY are looking pretty nice in after hours, too
The KING is gonna literally be able to afford a kingdom after this. Complete with a castle, drawbridge, and a pillory for all the Melvin shorts
They already make pretty good money honestly.
Buying
You're not arguing in good faith.

I'm trying to help describe what an exponential opportunity curve looks like.
One day I hope my wife's boyfriend gives her a child

Devaluing USD cucks Europe specifically Germany they have to devalue their currency too or no exports
Lmao try $50
Porque no los dos?
Amazon is a safe hold. I wouldn’t be worried. If you do want to sell, wait for a catalyst (earnings) and dump it then
I am retardo nice to meet you guys.
Yep, unfortunately
Hasn’t even started. This is the looong squeeze
GMGI BABY
Not cool
Wish I just followed my own advice on YOLO all on jan 15C 2021 Calls... hope that retard I told  like 3 months ago to get them is swimming in trendies.
http://imgur.com/a/wYOuqR8
Holy shit, this is gold. Buying more PLTR at open. Thanks for the DD.
I don't think even GameStop will offer Plotkin more than tree fiddy for his prolapsed anus.
So why are we excited for BBBY? BB and GME are gold, but it seems like the ship has already sailed for that one.
I missed the GME moon so hard. I paper handed like a bitch last Friday and I deserve every bit of shame. I won't even delete my old posts so I can remind myself of what being a paper handed bitch gets me (or rather doesn't get). So to make up for it, I'm going full retard and YOLO-ing hard into BB and I ain't touching it until January of next year. All other income shall go into NIO until their CEO "disappears".
Aye the last one bought me the parts for a sick ar pistol!
Thanks! Yeah, I will definitely look into cryptocurrencies and related fin-tech and get a (small) exposure to those assets.
Yes
we should lock up the sub. better have more quality than quantity. some people literally dont know what calls are but buy them blindly.
Who is “we”?
it's ARKK
I feel you bro, my money is frozen in PLTR right now. Just gotta be patient though
Jesus fuck. How long did you hold?
In all honesty, what percentage of your portfolio do you hold as shares?? I’m trying to find a good balance where I can maintain some good positions but also try to make money with stupid options plays that will probably lose money.
you must be a true autist to believe that, that's the end of the $BB rocket. HOMIE WE DIDN'T TAKE OFF YET LMAO

When you don’t have enough cash to take advantage of a huge dip in the market, is it a good strategy to sell some of your boring ETFs, like SPY or VOO, to buy individual stocks on sale?
You have way too many ETFs and mutual funds. Focus! Tesla is also a great [stock!](https://youtu.be/ChPjR5tM5lU)

GME still too low imo
As amazing as that sounds, we’re gonna need a fleet of whales for that to happen. Too many noob ejaculates wouldn’t be able to hold out for the grand prize.
This is exactly what will happen
30% - not planning to let go entirely short-term
GMGI going to $7 tmmr
What the fuck is a $PLTR. Doesn't look stonks to me.
I'd reduce AMZN by a lot, maybe to 10% of your portfolio. Maybe put the remaining 20% into QQQ or ARKK? 

If you only recently got into TSLA I'd reduce that as well - if you're sitting on massive gains that it's not as bad.
You’re one of them! Stay away.
When you don’t have enough cash to take advantage of a huge dip in the market, is it a good strategy to sell some of your boring ETFs, like SPY or VOO, to buy individual stocks on sale?
For those of us coming from the front page, can somebody do an ELI5 with a timeline of how we got to this point? Did they need to have $780k sitting around to pull off this large of a return or did some of that price paid come from the earlier options profits? As presented it looks like the ROI is 6x over a year or two, which is phenomenal, but not unheard of. Hell, I have peloton stock that is up that much over a shorter time frame. Granted nowhere near that amount.
Well thanks to my fellow retards here, I hopped on the gme wave yesterday and doubled my portfolio, and will now do the same with my recently acquired 1/22 11c’s on bb
I use etrade
Nah , it just take a brake for a while

Joe Buyden bout to become Nicholas Maduro. 


LETS EAT 🍽
RC is not going to let shares get diluted right now
When you look into it it helps that Michael Burry did that research first and bought 3% of Gamestop.

I mean I can research stuff too if I have a hint that someone who is way better at investing than me is already headed that way.

Just made google alerts for Michael Burry and Scion Asset Management.
Profits don't disappear, you just pay more of a premium. instead of 100-5, you take home 100-9.

The only problem is if you paper hands out after it trades sideways for a week, or if it goes down.
This! Maybe the boys at Melvin are paying him. But seriously, GME already paid off some debt early and still has plenty of cash on hand. On top of that, they had a killer holiday sales report. Why offer now?
By the time this is over the 99 bubble gonna look like an anthill next to Everest . Nasdaq 20k EOY
Here’s where it gets worse lol

Bag holding so many TSLA 1/15 calls I’m just hoping to break even or sell for smaller loss I’m down 62% / 20k on my total positions

I’ve got 850s, 860s, 900s, 950s, and 1000s lol 🥴
Make sure nobody trips over you
What does this mean for Melvin?
You're still retarded boyo.

hopefully so man, I'm in CLF, MT, VALE, thinking about picking up X on this "dip"
I have 1/15 35c, 2/05 20c and 2/19 40c on GME. What would be the best move for me at this point? Pretty new to the option games, just trying to play my part in the WSB GME takeover
This is the way.
TALENT!!!!
Uhhhhhhh......... are we entering a correction?
Im gonna do whatever DFV does.
i got them for gains on infrastructure annoucement from biden when he comes in. I will roll out for more if i get a good pop after that. i got a plan. can't go tits up.
There's not much available on the ask side, this might keep going up.
Maybe they like watching the squeeze too
GMGI*
Lol stop trying to be a gainz goblin
Good to know, I'll take take a look. Thanks!
Oh 15 minutes can’t come quick enough
So the idea is once we’re past there it’s smooth sailing to the next wall?
$1.9T stimmy? Gtfo Buyden. I was expecting $3T. Buyden got weak hands

You retarded
BB just got started today. I'd rather be at the beginning of the run than the end.
It’s back to 19 ah
doubt it but pray, I'm not on one of these autist weekly kicks but I have leaps
Starting to regret writing 1/12 CCs at 50
$MSOS, $AAPL, and the spicy play of $GME
Came to be part of history, staying till we are the history
Dude I swear I’m so much better at making money day trading FDs than I am buying and holding leaps. I think that means I’m retarded.
Just donated my entire 2 weeks pay to BB so looks like it’s ramen noodles for dinner till the end of the months boys
Do you have a strategy for timing the top or just wing it?
Bought 100 shares, sold a covered call at 45 for tomorrow when it was 30 and bought more shares with the upfront cost but I’m afraid it’s gonna cover lol
Can’t be. We will have back to back green days for this much money to get priced in.
Tough to say.  Do we even know how BB is pumping besides wsb ?
in few days/weeks there will be other retards like yourself saying: “Bought stock for the very first time this week and now put 200 on GME @68. Don’t know why I’m listening to you idiots but I’m on the train now”
Dude - I vaguely remember you from threads on which we discussed selling/buying KODK puts. Totally agree with you on implied vs realized vol on those options. On this trade I decided to take a position with you and buy some puts despite being very bullish long term on GME.
100% shares
I dont know if thai Stockholm is available om robinhood, på Fusion FUEL (HTOO) is a good play. Its widely known between Norwegians, and if we use the same multipels as NEL has, we see a 2200% upside in this one.
50+
A GME Sierra with the long bed so I can stack all the bags of money up when I cash out.
What if the SEC banned this subreddit. do they have the power?
DO IT. TOMORROW WE FEAST ON MELVIN
what even is GME
u/freehouse_throwaway thank you
Arks running after hours ?
Wow looks like [this guy](https://images.app.goo.gl/wsaqiQErZy8YHXR28) didn’t do his job
Melvin dead
melvins gonna have to suck the money out of our cocks after this
Yesterday up 6% AH, we opened +30% today

Today up 7% AH, we opened +69% tomorrow
Okay, but how can I buy those from Germany?
Pent up demand. Same thing will happen when people can fly outside the country again.
Retard checking in here. Just bought 58 shares. To the moon boys TO THE MOON! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🥲
Yeah you could’ve easily just gotta wrecked on a 0dte immediately at open
I don’t think they will - but I wouldn’t put it past them
why would you avoid oil, gas and finance? You wouldn't touch oil but you did airlines and cruises? what fuels both? plus they make dividends unlike beat up airline and cruise stocks.
True
Sold yesterday like a true retard
Today was flat look at open to close
My account is up 90% since october

Don’t worry, we got 💎🙌
Most definitely will. I’m buying stock shares myself, covering a lot of Yolo Contracts for you all here 💎🤝
lmao so childish
Damn that would crash the market lol
It may not in the coming weeks. But watch mid February- early March. Up up and away
lol to 1M
Think AAPL's gonna be more of a share play then?

Or do you actually have 165 call contracts and with it a 6ft penis
Yeah, Im not touching that one
Can the new meme be 1.8million Autists putting that stimmy into PLTR
I bet on an acca once and made an approx 50x return. It really is that easy. Of course, it’s also easy to lose. I guess the point here is that it luck means nothing.
Because if GameStop didn't exist, people wouldn't be able to find Xbox games?
Look at the fuckin beta built soy boy
Ok.
Company trading window? You means Wendy's drive thru?
We all know Buyden is turning the printer back on, guess the market just needs to hear it tonight.  Anyway, SPY $390 tomorrow 🥴
not me sitting here thinking GME was gonna dip after yesterday.... jesus christ how is it $42
Gonna make it by the end of the day tmrw if this keeps up
A meme, a myth, a legend
Doubt it
I thought GME was too late yesterday. Bought two call contracts today anyway. Up $500 at close and with this AH gap up, its gonna be $1000 tomorrow. 

If you can buy AH, you should do it. BB is still cheap.. might as well go in
Cathie working overtime
You can borrow from 401K? How?
Gme hasn't even started
4am I think
That's the way!
 🙏  🙏  🙏
I really hope so... went in to catch some quick momentum and sell, then got sucked punched
GME either going to the moon or crashing into hell tomorrow there's no middle ground
😄😄😄
Buy some shares with the gains
Better add BB in there you stupid nut
Yes🚀🚀🚀
We're not even close to the moon yet :)
Yeah the volume is pretty low and they cant do this quicker than at the very least two weeks which keeps premiums high. It is definitely a possible hedge tbh.
You guys see GME AH?
30% medium risk shares

20% high risk shares

50% options

This is what I do in my fun portfolio
I would hope that Cohen on the board shows that GME has shareholders interests in mind. Can you imagine the shunning if they had an offering.
No one can predict the future for you. Look back at the reasons why you invested in the first place and critique your research techniques. Learn from your past experiences and apply those lessons to future investments.
only risk about 10% of your portfolio with options. i mean if you are filthy rich and have high risk tolerance, then go for 70% lmao
Haha, I have positions in BBBY, GME, and BB.  What a weird few months it's been.
That’s way too bold. I rerolled my $265 September calls at a loss and added extra capital to get a call that was closer ITM

Unless baba hits $280 by February or close to it, ure probably gonna be in the red since the call will pretty much lose the rest of its intrinsic value just trying to get ITM in the last month

This isn’t even taking into account that if u ride the call to expiration, ure banking on baba being even higher than $280 just to break even on ur initial investment
Im holding about 80-85% shares and gambling the rest.. To be fair, most of those shares are Tesla
MJ 20c up 50% that expire in April.  I know weed stocks can be volatile but it was stupid.
Currently 2/12 $134C, 20 shares too.

Tomorrow I'll be settled and plan to sell a 1/22 put, one or two strikes ITM. If I'm not assigned I'll keep the premium and get myself to 100 shares. After earnings I'll sell a call and see if I can keep the income going.
Pltr isn't doing much
for everyone who doubted GME i hope you find a way to pay rent this month
The hidden scary time
RKT's contribution to my 2020 portfolio was integral to lowering my taxable gains lol
high short interest, share buybacks
Besides steal data? ;)
BREAKING: PETA bringing animal cruelty charges against Jerome Powell for causing bear extinction
Has GME hit 100?
Holy fuck how long can you keep this going?
Well it better hurry the fuck up. My 3/19 $100 need to start printing again.
Fb hit and bounced off the low it hit in September. People are insane to think fb should be same value it was in may. It’s growing 30% year over year.
im sure you're not either bitch
Whats your price target
Fuck yes. 2/19 16$ c
Lmao reddit let’s you block your own user name? Thinking about doing it

Stim talks going so so
Cost of labor =\= 100% of a businesses expenses.
All aboard
Really?? Lol well then what are you doing here?!
I sat on their bag for years, I'm not going back unless they get their shit together.  They lag on PR and their stock is fodder for P&D.  Hopefully, the new CEO will get them on the right path.  They're locked in on their Hydrofarm stocks until June and they've been shedding real estate trying to drum up operating capital.  Gonna be a bumpy road.
The difference between 100 shares and a contract at that price was around $200. For 20% more you could’ve owned the underlying asset
As long as you don't get margin called, you will make money. It's just a question of when.
The premiums are pretty nutty. What about selling covered calls to hedge? Obviously that's a risk of getting assigned if it rips higher.
Had to pick up some UVXY $11C for next week because you never know what could happen between now and then. Brutal selloff after tonight’s speech, some bullshit over the weekend, inauguration problems, whatever. It’s so low it’s on the verge of r/s so might as well hedge what’s left of my account lol
Riot
Jus buy some GME
Make JPow the secretary of treasury, not Yelen. JPow would fucking print money out of thin shit for us
Gme 2022 puts are gonna be looking spicy
More shares means more buying opportunities which means bigger moon missions. Buy it all
You can try anyway....
Lol everyone most importantly futuristier looking 
But does it work?
Do you have a link about the agreement? I've been looking for Sundial merger/purchase news for like 2 weeks with Sundial on my watchlist
BB tomorrow baby! 10c 1/15 bought at close.
HOLY FUCKNUCKLES! GME SUDDENLY DECIDED TO MOVE IT'S ASS AGAIN
Gay bears ruined New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day for me. Imma make sure they eat shit for this whole year. 🌧 🌈 🐻

Just stay in. Think back, how much would what you owned would be worth right now? If you had kept your resolve and held through you’d already be making bank. I let a slight inconvenience prevent me from adding 8k more when it dipped to 16 a share. (I originally bought at $18 a few months ago) I bought over 150 more shares between 32-37 bringing my average per share up but I’ve also made even more on rides and it hasn’t dropped significantly.

 Individual investors who recently piled into [GameStop](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GME) Corp. [GME **27.10%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GME?mod=chiclets)are taking a victory lap this week after shares of the struggling company surged more than 90% in the last two days, putting the stock on pace for its best weekly performance on record.

For weeks, members of Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets forum have been touting GameStop, encouraging others to scoop up shares of the videogame retailer and begin making bullish bets. Several posts on the forum had noted that short sellers’ bearish GameStop bets had been at elevated levels.

 On Reddit on Thursday, WallStreetBets users were celebrating GameStop’s gains. Many posted screenshots of big wins from bullish options bets. Several talked about how they would spend their profits. One user posted that the experience demonstrates that the WallStreetBets forum “runs the market.”
Vale heading to 20 dollar town tomorrow.

Never doubt Vale.
Yeah just got 2k in there
Hope GME doesn’t bleed all these gains. Come on just one more +20% day so we can all make it.
What is a realistic price target for GME? Are we talking like $50 or we talking like $100?
Bullish on Biden’s 1.9” package
Go 50% in ARKG leaps and don't by too many FDs.
We're not even squeezing yet. I think the true GME squeeze begins at $50 when the hedges have no choice but to capitulate or be destroyed. Right now, this is just intro to ass-raping... and Prof. Cohen hasn't even brought out the syllabus yet.
I bought 100 shares yesterday and 3 × 1/21/22 15C yesterday and as it started lifting, I picked up another 100 shares this morning and 3 × 2/26/21 15C for S&Gs. 

If this lifts off as much as it looks like it will, I'll have hit two major gainers this week (was holding GME for like 6 weeks.....almost sold l
It last week.)
Uhhh up almost 5% today? Holding April calls
2.5mil shares? Won’t even notice it.
42+ 🤑
I stopped (short-term) options when after two years, I had an overall big loss in options and a big gain in stocks. Mathematically with options, the odds are stacked against you unless you get lucky or you're selling premium.
If the stock goes up after u buy
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Yeah most of them expiring in a week at a way low strike. You need a drop tomorrow or you’re pretty fucked
Oh what a badass. I have 1/22 $125 calls and I'm not sweating it.


Ok maybe a little.
It means buy the dips.... America isn’t taking big Chinese company’s off the market

Jump!!!
You can do this in the app, it's in one of the account settings I believe.
I saw $BB going up today and I didn't even think to come to /r/wallstreetbets to see why.  Wish I didn't have to work and could trade full time every day.  Need to come here more often.  I was thinking of buying $BB last week so I will join you all tomorrow.

so say gme squeeze did it happen in the next few months, when is a good entry to exit? $100? $200?
Put it all in aggressive options to make 500x in a few months.
I hate this dude he is often on tv and full of shit.

What determines how fast referals complete pending process, my recent referals where almost instant and i was able to claim them within minutes of a referal being completed, i have 4 pending referals that has taken about 4 days, is this normal?
you carry over losses.
currently looking at model 3 listings but seeing how things are going AH i might be looking at model s listings tomorrow
They could only punish Reddit until they banned it.

I got $200 in a week and just invested in index funds lol
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 LET ME SEE THE TENDIES 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Do mods of wsb ever post positions or talk stonks?
Congrats!
Does anyone actually know what’s moving BB today?  Short squeeze?  Rumors?  Why all the volume somethings up
Yep they will print.  BB will be over 10 for sure tomorrow and maybe higher.

Buy more future dates calls tomorrow
i'll join you on this journey
You guys in BB are wild. I got in for maybe 5 minutes and got back out with my dinner paid for. Godspeed, gentlemen.
It’s so funny how retarded they are at Stocktwits. Every other post is someone saying to average up their puts or to short it. Like we know better in here to bet against Gme lmaooo
But they haven't raised capital so it doesn't mean anything
Im in jan 29 9.5s at .21, i may try to grab some later dated ones tomorrow if premiums arent fucked
Holy fuck dad can’t wait for you to give me a ps5
Tomorrow
You’re 
Gonna
Be
Loaded
I think the 25-28c has better R/R. It's a 50% retracement from the highs and is OTM enough to help avoid IV crush that will come with closer ATM strikes. Gotta be careful when IV is fuckin 300%.
You're right of course. Unfortunatley this is one of those Challenger models..
I guarantee reddit will once they go public
So could take longer for someone to buy them?
Depends, if they sell above Share price or below. But generally someone has to be bullish on them if they are buying Bought Deals or Private Placements.
Thoughts on;

* AVTR
* BA
* CRIS
* MRNA
* NIO
* NVAX
* PLTR
* SABR
* TSLA

Been holding on to these for near a year now, holding long term. Looking at some ETFs and maybe a few SPACs, but not too sure about the latter.

Take my upvote
That wasn’t bad. Pretty dope. Do GME next! 🚀🚀🚀
That's what I thought would happen with TSLA. Hasn't happened yet.
I never knew wtf TLRY was until today. I bought, and within an hour I was up 70%
Same here, brother. New GME. Wish I bought more
BB will run for sure. So is GME. Tomorrow is the actual sqeeeeeeze.

true just we're in a massive bull market and id rather make slow and steady profit then try and get rich quick. Im also a freshman in college so i have a while for it to grow before i actually need to use any of that money. My main goal is to make enough from stocks to invest in luxury real estate since its a much more stable market compared to commercial/low end real estate unless you're a house flipper
Do futures even matter anymore ??
Everytime I try to time the market and be extra clever I just do exactly the opposite from what I should have done. Do you have any tips?

GME
Bro I feel you. Yesterday saw it moon, waited and then bought at 37. Stop loss laced at 34 hit so quickly and that was it. Watched it all unfold ever since. Thought about buying but every time I think “oh no”.

Well fuck me. Should have just bought and held.

You will regret that move buddy. I sold some shares yesterday (my portfolio was 100% GME), and I can't live with myself today. Waiting patiently for a dip to go all in again
lol on what grounds could they do that
Up 6.87% in after-hours so far...
Did you hold?
"Struggling." Lmao

CNBC’s ticker is faster than Robbinghoop’s, it’s off by 20 seconds or so from a broadcast that has its own delay. I’ll have to look at ToS’s delay vs CNBC. sometimes they pump a stock and I see the effect they have.

Thoughts on GOEV
I wouldn’t be surprised to see BB go to $15 by early next week
Dilution isn't a snap decision thing.  They certainly can dilute their shares, but that's going to take a board meeting and those just don't materialize out of thin air unless there is an emergency.  I also don't think Cohen is going to let them just shit out a bunch of shares as soon as the price spiked.  He wants the shorts to bleed too.  Once all the shorts have been margin called or closed their positions, then I would hope they would do a share offering as that would be a great way to raise capital for their new direction and continued growth.
BB & GME FREE FUCKING MONEY.

THESE ROCKETS ARE MASSIVE 🚨🚨🚨

So why is BB going up? I don’t want to buy high sell low again
I don’t have webull (China owned pos) but I remember hearing a YouTube saying 4am PM.
Yes if stock go up after you sell a put, you get the premium. But if the stock continues to go down, the person who buy the put can exercise it which means you will have to give them 100 stocks for each contract you sold them. Covering simply mean you buy the 100 stocks at the strike price. So if you sell a put at strike price $10, and it continues to go down, the person can exercise the put and force you to buy their 100 stocks at $10 even though you could have buy them at a lower market price.
OK BOOMER! THATS THE WAY!

ONE OF US! ONE OF US!

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
This isn’t exactly a hedge it’s a covering imo. Otherwise they would naturally let the price action happen but it looks like they pump it to strike price and the exercise
> Of course the numbers are higher for every other car company because there aren’t that many Tesla’s on the road!!

thats why ratios and percentages exist. Tesla has built over 1 million cars, around 198,000 kona Ev's have been built. Tesla has not had 14 spontaneous fires in the last 2 years, even if you include the ones caused by high speed collisions.

what made you think i was not considering "percentage ratios" in my comparison to the kona EV?

I view it somewhere between investments and the lotto. It's calculated gambling, with less risk as consequence. With how fast money plops out, it's worth the risk imo and is my current default. I am already broke, a hundred dollars here and there from my paychecks for some fast potential profit is fine by me, either I am still broke afterwards or I am less broke.

Oh sorry I misunderstood. The chart in the post only shows profit as the balance, not the actual account. My bad.

Sell so you can get more GME.
It’s all about perspective. There’s a janitor out there making minimum wage ($7.25/hr) that slaved away for 8 hours and grossed $58 for the day.

Saw that on Dow Jones. They even quoted one of us autist.
It's always so much worse when your stock hits +10% at 11AM and then drifts down to close at +5%, than if it had opened at 0% and closed at +3%
You need to get your eyes off of it. I bought apple, went red, I sold, eventually gained like a motherfucker. I lost money because I worry too much. I didn’t make a profit because I worry too much. Meanwhile the people that held get to listen to the news about how great it’s doing and I just sit with nothing.
It’s amazing that I’m gonna somehow lose money with these 43c tomorrow.
So, this is probably a very dumb question. However, how do you know hedge a bet like this? 

I don’t believe it’s all luck..

You're wrong. Don't use that total return website, I've seen how it compares to the actual results you get when you do your DD and actually plot it all out in Excel. It doesn't just miss spinoffs, it somehow gets the dividend reinvestment math wrong. 

Jan 14, 2001 was a Sunday and the 15th was MLK Day. So we'd use the price as of Jan 16, 2001. The closing price was $40.91. The closing price today was $50.31, and remember it's just starting to climb out from a once in a lifetime oil crash. It paid a lot of dividends over those years. It's a great company to own.
This is the top because Supreme kids are buying GME instead of hypebeast shit.

Who remembers that GME dip after that shitty earnings call...oh the nostalgia...and I almost sold.
yeah they'll hedge the 200 shares, but youll get margin liquidated (at a profit, but a lesser profit) on larger positions pretty quick if its melting down.

Biden’s administration seems pretty adamant about the US being the leader of the new EV rising and clean energy leader. I don’t know if these companies will get barred from the market but I’m very skeptical of the accessibility of these products coming into the US. I’m not certain of anything ofc.
I hired a bullshit website designer on there that didn't know what he was doing, still got my money so calls i guess
Can’t decide if I stay all in BB or if I ride on the GME train definitely both will 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I also am. Infinity squeeze happening soon.

I am not throwin' away my calls  

&#x200B;

I am not throwin' away my calls  

&#x200B;

Hey yo, I make my bets on wall street  

&#x200B;

'Cept I don't make any money  

&#x200B;

But I'm not throwin' away my calls

&#x200B;

\\---

&#x200B;

I gotta bag full of Palantir shares  

&#x200B;

I probably shouldn't brag, but dag, my tendies don't even care  

&#x200B;

The problem is I got a lot of brains but no hair  

&#x200B;

I'm starting to pull em out, with every doubt  

&#x200B;

It's unfair

&#x200B;

  

\\---

&#x200B;

But I'm a diamond in my hands, soon you'll see the plan  

&#x200B;

Passin' tendy land, my power of grip, you will understand  

&#x200B;

Only just a mediocre robinhood trader  

&#x200B;

But the power of reddit is it makes the dummies braver  

&#x200B;

Every burden, every disadvantage  

&#x200B;

That I try to manage, I don't have the funds to brandish  

&#x200B;

Soon I'll walk these streets famished  

&#x200B;

The plan is to fan this buck into a brick  

&#x200B;

But damn, it's getting light, so let me say this real quick:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\\---

  

Just know that P-L-T-R  I-S  C-O-M-I-N-G for thee  

&#x200B;

So listen to my words real thoughtfully  

&#x200B;

Though, shitty Citi shittin' on us so awfully  

&#x200B;

Essentially, they short it and gawk at me  

&#x200B;

But soon Magikarp turns around and what'll we see? 

 

A sea of green that you've never ever dared believe  

&#x200B;

So much we could open up our own dispensary  

&#x200B;

"Start entering", Karp says in parentheses,  

&#x200B;

"Don't be shocked when your history book mentions me  

&#x200B;

I will lay down my life if it spikes the stock  

&#x200B;

So drop the block, you'll see the ascendancy"

Ask anybody why we diamond hand, and make demands

&#x200B;

Where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went?

&#x200B;

Is that a guarantee for us of future tendies?  

&#x200B;

Or will the red be bled forever and ever and ever with no discrepancy?

&#x200B;

  

I know the action in the street is excitin'  

&#x200B;

Between the GME calls and the SPCE crew bitin' but  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Are we subreddit that can lead the nation?

Also mods how many Hamilton posts do I have to do before I get some flair? Just curious if I should buy calls or puts on me ever getting a hamilton-wsb mashup flair and how much effort it will require so I can promptly give up the dream.
Jumped on my first ever option with this. Picked up 1 $12.50 call for 1/29 a couple hours ago.  Now I have to figure out what the fuck I'm supposed to do with a damn call.
Thanks for the reply :)

I FOMO'd too. Were in the same boat my friend
ok who the fuck is /u/deepfuckingvalue
0 for me. Started in December with 600 bugs and sticked to Kostolany "If you have no money, you HAVE to speculate" now at 2.4k and buying calls min 2-3 mons out, and debit spreads. I would rather buy debit spreads than the stock itself.
Nice DD, we should get together and talk yolios and EDs soon.
it’s like Kobe Bryant in WSB using NBA terms

85% shares 15% options
Let Melvin be a lesson to you 🐻
hey guys, i understand that concentration in portfolio is important for high return, but try to diversify your portfolio a bit by having 50% GME and 50% BB.
Then he also has to tell Uncle Sam i.e. the IRS. Anyway with the strength of the SFR I don't think he could afford even a basic SwissPost account...
It's disappointing to qualify for it, tbh.
So do I just like toss in my life savings or
I sold it before the massive run up, long term capitals gain had kicked in and I wanted off Elon's wild ride after the drop down to 180.
WSB DD
I could be a dick and tell you the opportunity you missed, but I won't. this sub has already pointed it out. My advice: invest in something that gives you a dividend or an etf. seriously google good safe etf, or etf for a specific sector you like and buy it. Don't touch it for a while and I guarantee it'll  do great
1. I'm planning on buying sth affordable in Italy, Germany is too cold and expensive, that would cost me a 100k
2. Brother (or sister), I have no other cash, earn that money next to my studies

Thanks for the help!
Keep us posted

As I posted  earlier exit TSLA  get onboarding GME.  Ride the momo.
I'll be more pissed when the price of bread does the same.
I ALSO SEE CALLS for $15 -> BB 15C 1/15 Let's GOOOOOOOOOOO
Comment saved for when I'm not dumb with my money and actually understand investing. Thanks for the heads up.
I sure hope not, I have a couple August calls way otm, hoping it gets dragged along the ev train

Yessir 💰
I have calls 1/22, so earlier the better 🚀🚀🚀
This. I also have a few SPY leaps bought ATM in the boring account.
How are you feeling ahead of tomorrow?
Gme has been doing very well pre market almost everyday. Maybe my memory is incorrect but I can't recall a rally so bullish after hours in recent memory. I think its very possible that our run up has not ended and that if pre market tomorrow, if we boost up even more that Friday will be a really strong day going into the long weekend.
Just want wealth for everyone

They couldn’t even do enough research to know where “runs the market” started at.
Omg my apha calls going wild
Oh how inflation is gonna suck
See this is kind of where I’m at. I like your answer haha
famous last words
I think $24-$25 is pretty fair. It would be amazing to see it climb back to ATH of $186.93, but I think that would have to invoke divine intervention to even get a chance at going that high.
I have 54 behind you
Cause WSB sent it to the MOON!!!!
Fixed #3. Also added a new method for resetting prices. Instead of the price being reset as soon as you move the option, it will stay and can only be reset if you click the option and click the new reset button, or click the overall reset button at the top (which also pulls the latest prices)
Baby “potential” gains in the daily thread please.
What platform you using to buy shares/ options?
Everyone hates CenturyLink as a product though. They own the rights to the Seahawks and Sounders stadium (Lumen Field) which is a good sign at least, lot of advertising and brand awareness. 

The dividend return is pretty enticing, will wait and see, seems to fluctuate a bit and could drop again to 8-9 range again for a nice price point
There's no flex here. It's education about the term "net worth."
ARKG flying AH
Cathie fucking wood is the reason why.
BB short squeeze?
Me after playing GME for two days: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTZETtLCZZ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTZETtLCZZ0)
I see no reason why wsb can't pump BB to $20 in short time.
are you talking about MSRT or MSTR (microstrategy)
This needs to be more visible.
It was 43+
*PLTR INTENSIFIES*
yup
Buy some fubo at open. Look at how it came back all day and forming a cup and handle
Yeah 40 year olds are the bridge one foot in old world and one foot in zoomer world.
I sold $25 1/15 Calls against my 10,000 shares of GME and I'm sad... I scored them at 16 bucks.

Oh well, the premium was sweet and the capital gains earned is nice.  

But GOD DAMN 16 to 40+ would have been a little better
as of now, the model 3 is the better car. more fun to drive than the S, but that can change when the refresh happens for the S. i wish Elon would make it official so TSLA can moon already.
This isn’t an angry upvote. But there is some irony in you making a dad joke making fun of boomer grandpa.
So on a scale of 1 to 10 how fuked are my ICLN calls
No homo I just want to say that I’m really fucking proud of all you guys.

Anyone know Fidelity’s cutoff for selling a mutual fund? I ask cause I sold a mutual fund at like 3:15 and am wondering if I’ll have that money to invest tomorrow.
GME 69 tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Just did it, 500 more into GME FUCK IT
That’s the rub that I have been grappling with lately.

When is somebody TOO close to the industry to be trusted, vs when is someone too distant from the industry to effectively fill the role?
its not moving much AH tho
0.0%
I think worst case, I'm down 35k tomorrow. Best case I'm up 300k. It will be interesting.
Ok I read $BB enough times, imma buy 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
it's going to hit $100, don't sell like puss when hits 50 and retraces to 42 ok? deal?
It may actually show up on the chart with AH low volume, probably would get lose in the chart during trading hours eh
because WSB has assumed direct control
if GME hits $1,000 by end of next week i will buy a monkey and train it to ride a dog
He sold them. 2.6 million cash out.
The 1/15 gains you mean?
icln pleas fly again
What do you mean? WSB owned like 10% of shares at one point. is that not a high enough amount to change the market movement of a stock?
Congratulations and go fuck yourself(term of endearment around here).. maybe.

What are your yearly expenses? If you're spending $100k annually, then retiring on what you've got saved up may be difficult. If you spend $35k, then ya you will probably be fine. Make sure to factor in things like health care that work has probably been subsidizing considerably for you. The super-general rule is to have saved 25x your expenses and not withdraw more than 4% annually.

As u/bananahut8 pointed out, make sure you're retiring TO something and I think you will be set. A lot of people fall into that trap and it's something that worries me when the time comes. I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up.

Small town midwest vibe is the best, isn't it? Not sure what you hunt, but hope you got a freezer full of venison this year!
Hey guys, what are your civil war stock picks?
This. I'm not worried about a crash, but a correction is imminent. When? Who knows, so long as vaccines are rolling out, stimmy cash keeps people afloat, and interest rates stay low I don't see any real reason for people to pull money from the market entirely. Moving cash from high flyers to recovery plays? Yes.
I have a sell at $100 to take out my initial investment, then some at $250, then some at $495.  Letting the other half ride.

It's looking nice all year long. Just keep taking gains and rolling it out.
It won’t be in the Bill anyway

Exactly, they are just much more cost effective than their competitors. Hence why they’re getting government contracts. This company has so much growth potential. I’m interested to see how they grow and what their stock price will be end of 2021. I’m holding for the long term and will keep building my position. 26 January is a key date and the lockup period, primed and ready to moon my friend.

>and gain 2

no you have a 3000 tax deductible in 2020.  So you will owe taxes on 3000 dollars for year 2. 

year 1: lose 20 k end of year i have a 3k tax deductible.  now my loss is 17 k 

year 2: make 20 k and i dont pay taxes on the first 17k. on the last 3 k i pay tax because that loss was deducted in the previous year
Bro i’m never fucking leaving again
i dunno but just remember, nobody got hurt selling early to take a prrofit.

I can invest $500 right now. BB or GME, and should it be shares or calls. Lot of new information for me today.
🐝gang buzzin again
The 1/15 one should be sold though, right?
Bought ARKG at 100, rode it down to 93 and then back up to 100 and got off the ride.  Little salty that it couldn't wait for me to get out of GME before it started going ham again.

Disclaimer: I have a small position in Gevo.

I bought in once I read their earnings call and saw that they paid off their long term debt, signed a new deal with Koch and are opening their Net Zero carbon plant soon. Unlike Fuel Cell, which even its CEO projects won’t be profitable for years, GEVO is finally in profit after years of struggling.

I see them as a great buy in the $6-8 range.
lol the AH volume made up half the volume today... hahahah
I’d regret it more if it sells off tomorrow than if it shoots up another 20%+
So this plan is just the foreplay to the climate change infrastructure one coming in a couple weeks. More time to load up
We all might be able to kick our wife’s boyfriends out finally!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
If anything it’s probably better for retail. It’s a lot harder for Mom and Pop shops to foot that $15/hr minimum wage, which may mean the end of a lot of small businesses given that on top of the covid losses they’ve had over the last year
Large projected market share of software in automobiles in QNX. Potential massive EV share of that market.

Evolving from the old smartphone company we first knew of.
Oil stocks have been hot the last 2 months and I expect that to continue. They’re still undervalued and as you said inflation will only increase their price. Right now I think refining stocks are a good play but I would wait until after Q4 earnings. Currently they’re going to be bleeding quite a bit of money as demand for refined products is still low but oil prices have increased. Once demand increases post lockdown I think those stocks will see a significant gain. Personally I think VLO and MPC are both good investments going forward. Even with the big run the last two months FANG is my favorite in terms of oil exploration companies.
Gains unites us all. If Biden wants to unite the country, pump the market. No one cares if you are left or right when you both ride the GME rocket to space.

Lol a million dollars won’t impact a multi billion dollar company bruh
GME, that is all.
Permanent mod and king of this sub now
You know it
Why the hate on TLSS? This is and always has been a long hold in my eyes, or at least a few months.

For sure, you are getting off-topic.
Shorts. 68-71m shares short with a float of 67m shares. Yep, shorts are getting crushed.
Well $50 is likely tomorrow. I think realistic might $100 for a brief moment 🤏
Said that since yesterday and should have gone all in.
He was one of us all along
can you teach me or create a course?
Shit I may exercise these GME calls
How many did you buy? Looks like 3c 2023 only have a volume of 3, I don't know if anyone would sell to fill the orders at the low price
Thanks man will get on that on payday
That close was tough for the $40's that is hilarious.
yes! I'm a huge wuss but GME still made me 4k this week.
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ks4s3s/bb_king_the_blast_from_the_past_with_the/) is what started it [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo4ed/looking_for_the_next_rocket_look_no_further_than/)

But basically, electric vehicle software is the center of it all.
To anyone with GME. Set your stops at $100 and uninstall Robinhood. Your order will go through, but you won't be able to look at it and sell with paper hands.
Sounds like a plan. I’ll try to sell at opening before the selloff happens
Get a lawyer, seriously. The SEC will be contacting you and you may as well get ahead of it. not suggesting you did anything wrong, but just arm yourself.
ICLN is GaPInG uP AH!!
I’m currently planning on closing my positions one week ahead of expiration. Is this a generally safe time frame or is it dependent on a case by case basis?
Good job son...I shouldn't have gone out to buy milk...
Buy it today. Worst case you lose $300 and you have a hundred years to make that up. Grandma will give you that for your birthday. Or you'll make it back in a week with a part time job.   
Best case you make $1-$3k.
You're right to point out PFE's large market cap being part of the equation. COVID contract w/ Operation Warp Speed is $1.95 billion. Compare that to last quarter, when they generated more than $12 billion in revenue, or annualized to nearly $50 billion. 

Granted, that's only the first contract I found, and I only researched it for the sake of this post, so that's only a few seconds of DD, but it still paints a clear picture why its stock price moved so little in comparison to MRNA, whose quarterly revenue is ~$150 million, with an M.
Why now if it's going to $60 soon? No cash raise while short interest is above 50%
Build your back up. I plan on buying on red days.
I like this one, ty
Maybe because CRISPR is gapping 🤷‍♂️
Got my whole portfolio in this meme
I bought 15c at 11/19. The fair value of the stock is like $18 and internet connectivity is going to be a major part of the stimulus plan.

This is a good play. But there are like 20 other good plays I'm split between.

This is a free 10 bagger.
It shows me the ratio is still 32? Where you get 19

It’s to keep us in line to the overlords. Boomer bullshit
Not selling before its at $35 😤
We don’t have mods moron it’s a lawless fuckfest here

I honestly don't understand boomers fucking 10% a year. My boring account is already up 10% ytd and we're not even through January
Fuck I truly am retarded. I was referring to MassRoots. MSRT, which you clearly do not own. Doh.
The articles aren’t mentioning it. I’m guessing that’ll have to come from congress.
I'm going to say a prayer for you. Get paid, brother.
Teaching options at the DOD? Long LMT, BA 🚀
I don't think the premiums are unreasonable given the setup and the recently expressed volatility. No free lunches in stocks, except buying calls on this last summer.

Etf best bet. Go with accumulation as it’s less hassle.
Ain’t it a bitch :) also add the premium received to the strike, so 9 +whatever is what you’ll have made... idk if that helps
This.
are you being sarcastic?
I feel like I missed the train with GME but bought some today anyway just to feel included
No! We’re seriously getting TOO much attention now. And he’s going to talk about how GME should do an offering, I swear. This man hates us.
I am. Are you familiar with the concept of "net worth?"
Looking forward to $50 tomorrow
Scan for short squeezes, find a good entry, buy calls, then wait for the pop.
I got some VXX to hold for next week.
Reminder, cramer a few weeks thought BB a phone company and compared them with Apple who he said he likes better. Dude's an out of touch boomer.

Cramer I know you read this sub. There are a bunch of people on wsb who play the market better than your cnbc "experts"

I bet you dont even have a poster of Su Bae on your wall
which positions? or shares
Noice
The next GME
It's going to store, presence in life style of being fundamental to your childhood.

It can't be undersold.

They also don't want big box to have leverage power of distribution over them.
yeah except gamestop's market cap is only 2 billion, and 200 million dollars worth of shares not being sold definitely has an effect. its not this bullshit narrative that wsb is responsible for all of gme's movement that people on here parrot, but its definitely not nothing either. 

also, jeff bezos could literally buy gamestop 70 times over and still have plenty of billions left
Wasn't the Google purchase in talks forever.  What were they thinking?
Nobody gaf about these children’s gains, shoulda been in GME
Sensible, I like it
Does he have the cash to exercise?

YES IT WILL CONTINUE MOONING 

NO ITS NOT TOO LATE

50+ TOMORROW 

NEXT WEEK 80+

I am getting AMDicked rn
Ahh my man. So ATH = All time high. Thx. Too retarded
Does Etrade not update your account balance AH? I feel like there must be a way to see this and I am just missing it but the more layers I peel away from the Etrade platform...the more stupid little issues like this I uncover...
Also, good job, OP. You made it.
How many shares of BB should I buy?
just keep your politics to a minimum folks. the only politics here is money making. 

Also if you don't like taxes come on up to canada where you can trade FDs in a tax free account.
TSLA stock hears you. TSLA stock don't care.
But also. Yeah. Definitely want to hear it lol.
This is r/wsb but I can’t wish you good luck. I’m holding through a drop anyways I got April expiring and shares
Well 24 isn't too far otm. 1 gpod earnings and we can blow past that
If you look up like 10 tickers you remember, I think you'll be able to guess. The behavior is not at all inconsistent.
Thanks for the DD bro
40 minutes til biden pumps icln for me right?
Alright, I have to know. Bought in a 2/26 $50C. Did I fudge myself on it or was that a good move????

If we're blowing up in the news than this platform is about to gain a whole  lotta new degenerates... with maybe $25 to their name... looking for the next meme.... oh wait, PLTR is $24.87 rn 🚀 🚀
There’s a group of people on here that are boosting thier investments on reddit recently. P&D sorta stuff please beware !!
It’s never worth the $20 you are saving. I do this too and remember to talk myself out of it.
Agree ICLN can't go tits up under Buyden. I actually got and rolled them to Jan 2022 so I don't have to worry about them for a long time. ICLN is an ETF.
Having trouble with women?  Pay for things with your Robinhood card and casually tell them that you're long GME.  Real long.   You'll have a full black book in no time.
Inflation fallacy...look it up. Puts on retail stores/restaurants will be a mistake
Can't put kids in cages (unless you're ICE) but you sure can put a dog in a cage. Dogs cheaper than kids
probably about 10x on most jan/15 calls that have strike in the mid-low 20s range.
yea i saw it spike 7% ah but still, palms sweaty rn
Join the GME fight with your fellow warriors
Ahh wouldn't have sold the GME just yet. I think there is a little bit more to gain there. Anyways, I believe more in BB as a company right now so it's a good move and they flew about the same height today. Good on you!
Hells yes 🙌
So 2k stimmy talk tonight.
I'm worried by all the suspicions people have, however, if this is a pnd, we've not seen the p yet. Still a chance to grab something  first thing in the morning then bail.

Selling PLTR for GME 😂. Then selling covered calls to buy OTM Calls.
it isn't heavily shorted
...Except that Coke and Pepsi don’t have our tax money and are dependent in the service industry that’s closed down, but go off retard
But like who’s money are we taking lol
Thank you. Wanted to know lyrics.
hope my one gme 35c i bought for 6.10 gets enough profit to offset the 20 SPY 385s i bought 😂😂😂
Samesies. 

Double kudos, comment OP
No course. Chat with me if you have questions.
Whats that?
Are my ARKG 1/15 124c safe?? 💀
Prob continue to feel sick until you load up on berries mate. Calls and stonks.. it's for your health..

More tomorrow, we will see $80

Yea. I sold my 30c 1/15 in 2 batches today and bought more shares. Sure I may miss out on tendies tomorrow but I feel more secure with shares and my head isn’t on a swivel checking it every 5 mins
Those after hours $BB numbers we soaring tomorrow
ya it really is
Yoloing my entire paycheck into BB tomorrow
There was a short window of amazing opportunity for about 20-30 minutes between 10:00-10:30am when the stock dropped/flattened and IV dropped. 50c 1/15 were in the 0.50 range at that point. I got in at open unfortunately but if it keeps going it will still pay off pretty big.

At this point you're probably better off just buying shares if you want to hop on the rocket since the premiums are outrageous and will stay outrageous until the squeeze is done probably.
Lyrics are in the comments below. Scrolling lyrics would have taken me even longer and we all know how short attention spans run around here
Keep putting in the work. You are gaining experience with your trades. Limit your risk and learn from your mistakes.   


As of today, SPY is +15.69% for the trailing year. If you're +10% and you're just learning, you're doing alright.
Autistic market levels never before seen.
I'd be a little more skeptical of a younger company, but we inherited this pension system from a MUCH older company (1800s: think Merck, Abbott, Pfizer). That said, I'm aware things can go south (GE comes to mind...).

I'm leaning toward including it and considering it a bond as was suggested above, but keeping in mind its not risk free.
I concur. I was in a lot on Intel leaps because of January effect, but even with new leadership I have little confidence in their ability to gain market share going forward. I don’t even consider it a distressed asset at 45, let alone what it’s at now. May go up, but AMD has a lot of pent up momentum to go into.
Get fucked
My God bro I'm asking myself the same question.  I don't know.  My gut tells me not really but at $10 the market might eat this motherfucker up.  And for that reason alone I'd take the risk.
Would it be a WSB if it hadn’t?
but what if GME goes to $420.69?!
30 GME
Well, Dow Jones quoted someone here saying “we running the market” lol.
Still worth jumping on this at market open tomorrow or too late once again?
I'm trying out selling puts - thats why it shows as a negative I think. My thought is free premiums on top of calls as long as the stock closes above $36 tomorrow - no idea who is buying these puts I'm selling.
I feel for you brother.
gay
it’s okay you’re in good company here
A 13D was filed with the SEC today for a 5% stake of SPCE...

Stop losses are dumb.

They are the only trade you can make to guarantee you sell your shares when the market is down.

Just be patient and wait the downturn out.  Do not sell.
Buy high sell low
Clearly I'm retarded. I'll actually read more than the title for later
Yes

I really don't understand why people gamble on anything but stocks. As long as you are a bull, you have like 80% chance of winning. Every time.
Why?
on GME? oh shit if true.

If that by some miracle becomes true, I should have enough to retire.  God that would be nice.
Haha nice, hope you're making some money on GME!
Look to my coming, at first light, on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East...
If you only have options then no
Why did I chose to buy FCEL 😭 everyone’s eating except us
Good luck man.
Ummmm lol
Where all the “iTs ThE NeXt BlOcKbUsTeR” pussies at now??? Hahahha fucking losers
That would be wild as shit if all of us autists exercised our 1/15 calls instead of sell to close.  Talk about a fucking moon shot.

Well I bought $25 calls on Wednesday and they are up 7,000%. Imagine only buying 5...lol
Sold some of my GME calls to rotate into TSLA around lunch time. Bad decision.
Ah, so I should hold these till time expires then buy more shares?
you realize, in order to make money, let’s take ICLN for example, the underlying will have to pass 33 early to make money tomorrow
If you don’t fomo like a retard I don’t think you belong here

After hours order book for GME is hilarious. Nobody selling and a mountain of bids
Can’t tell if GME graph is more erect than my dick or if it’s the other way around. The graph is definitely longer though
Might be people exercising calls on people who never thought they'd get caught writing stuff $20/100% otm
Ya but in-between 2001 and now it hit $100+ multiple times.  So you did lose most of your gains if you kept holding.  Youd be up 150% if you sold at 100$ but instead you’re only up 25%.  The dividends sure will boost your gain but not by 125%.
🤫🤫🤫
Price hits 15$ before 2/5 and he gets $

Does anyone know what major I should do? I want to focus in portfolio management and equities. Also a financial analyst too so I can make retarded price targets and pump my own bags. I want to be like Mommy Cathie, Bill SPACman and Chamath. 

I looked at what Cathie did when she was young and she did Finance and Economics, seems pretty intuitive but I was looking for opinions.

I found Business Admin: Investments to be interesting. What should I take to get a CFA also?
All I know about options is, buy calls of you think it goes up, and puts if you think it goes down. So far it’s worked out
sounds perfect to me. Another dip opportunity!
Famous last words 😂
In college I had a job in the computer science's IT department that amounted to being "on call" for any IT issues professors had in their classrooms. I actually got a small office in the top story of the computer science building. I could count on my fingers the number of times I actually had to do anything.

Paid minimum wage, but I was paid to basically have a quiet office I could use to study, do homework, etc. Had that job for two years. Second best gig ever in my working career.
Shares
I'm seeing OI of basically 0 at all of the strikes above 40. Not sure how many were opened today but it has to be almost irrelevant compared to everything below 40
Troll GME shorts on various message boards
What is happening next week to make it 80+, i'm a noob.
No mention of climate in nyt alert... worriesome
200 shares currently at 8.90 and I bought 30 contracts for $9 1/22. I was sweating going forward 1/15 in case Biden fucked up.
Yep. Bought them for $3 around open. Gonna get fucked unless we go up to 60 lol
Lol I was just in the shower thinking this shit hits the 60’s this year
This is the way.
I’m new to trading, why does my Fidelity account show GME at $39.91 while my RH account shows it at $42.60?
Hahahhahaha it sounds like you have tsla calls with shorty expiry and so OTM
Congrats man
Don't FD into EFTs 😢
Np bro I explained that poorly
ICLN is such a disappointment
That feeling when your FD hits.... It's better than sex.
BOXL finally broke above the $20 band today (up 23%) and is going to keep going. $5.15 price target.
TSLA less volatile than MSFT change my mind
pls dont use the words "big" and "red" so close to each other. Scary stuff
This is really great news for stocks!  Buy buy buy!
Congrats, that’s awesome. Unfortunately being 22, didn’t have as much to risk as I would like. Still was able to make more than an average 22 year old should have, happy with it.
Pleaseeeeeeeee I need this 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I think so, I'm picking up more tomorrow.
yes daddy joe. Gimme that green 🍆
I agree, my best gains seem to be overnight and into the morning. I enjoy selling in pre-market, instead of waiting for the 9:30 chaos.
Basically is 2b in new funds so double stimmy whammy
He had over 1 million cash available. You don’t need to exercise all your contracts, do you? He had 1000, could he exercise 500? But either way, I think he might hold the money to exercise is $12 April calls
Loaded up with CCL and DAL calls. Covid numbers are only going to look better from here and once people really start to see the light at the end of the tunnel travel is going to 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Giving wallstreetbets a chance today joined in on the bb & gme train 🚀🚀🚀🚀
will PLUG go back up?
No I know that. I’m holding shares but it isn’t updating with the AH price
Can someone who knows about options message me? Wondering if you can still make gains afterhours or if theres a max profit you can make on a call.
Why have shares? Do leaps instead???
Gme 420.69 funding secured

Reminder: fuck melvin
Just curious here...do you have some method that you go by where you say "yep, now's the time to buy this penny stock"? The financials and the earnings are so bad for so many of them...I just can't figure out how people finally pull the trigger on these penny stocks.
GME to 95 eow
Prob low. I’m just glad I would finally qualify for the damn check since I’m a college dependent.
Well, I guess we'll let the company do the talking on 1/28/21.
Will FCEL go back up tonight? Maybe?
Theta gonna bang me. Bought near open today
Most true thing I’ve ever read
Buy more gme, problem solve
also have ENPH calls, they can't stop going up.
Take us to tendie town.....on Juptier
Tell me they expire tomorrow?
You should buy GME instead
If y'all aint in CCIV you're going to miss out
GME 🚀🚀🚀 what else you need to know to spend your money on?
$1.9 T stimulus plan... LOL rip Bears. Markets going to fucking double every year, everyone gets $100k
1.4k but yeah 2k total
Y’all missed GME huh?
Ok, fellow defend I got 1k to burn. What's the play? Shares or calls?
my calls went into the thousands of percentages from morning until that afternoon.
Lol fuck I sold this morning
I bet 1000 GME shares that you didn't listen to the earnings call
you're right. I remember that shit. LL was like a 300 mill market cap which is actually pretty easy to manipulate if you can convince wsb to get in on it. It was like as soon as that post hit wsb the stock ran like 15-20%. its the reason that the sub bans tickers that are under a bill
What time should i sell my GME 1/15 calls tomorrow? Is any time after noon pushing it??
Me. There’s a divergence between EUR/USD and dollar index
Why
They give us theirs tendies and we are now their wives boyfriends

That's awesome!! My trades were awful and I lost bunches. I started doing some investigating into things that have long term potential and started buying fractional shares of various solar power and renewable energy. Last week I made $200 in one day. Keep it up, it's a great feeling!!!
Excuse me, Mr. Melvin, I have a Mrs Margin on the line, she says she’d like to know when she can expect her shares. What would you like me to tell her?

I'm not trying to be a 🌈🐻, for real, I love 🚀 as much as the next guy. But Black Berry is not the 🚀 you wanna be on..

I used to own a Blaack Berry Bold 9700 or whatever rit was back in a day. Had to make 2 911 emerhency phonecalls in life or death situations then. Both times someone died. In one of those situations the victim could have been saved if they could have gotten there seconds sooner. But.. Both times the emergency call dropped. Fucking dropped! Just like their 🚀. Through the investigations they found that the call dropping was 100% the devices fault. I found out then that they were notorious for dropped calls and very quickly bought a differant brand phone.
Probably the news it sold over 90 patents to Huawei

2 2/19 $9 calls for $336 lets gooo
I didnt. I bitched out when it dropped and took a $1000 loss...but im up $1,800 today and life moves on 😏
So I believe my broker (Fidelity) will exercise contracts at 4:15 PM EST if they are ITM (https://www.fidelity.com/options-trading/options-auto-exercise-rules)

I plan on using cash to fund the transaction, rather than margin, so technically it should follow cash account rules, rather than margin account rules. I have not actually tried this with Fidelity, but with E-Trade, my 0-day contracts which are ITM get auto-liquidated at 3:50PM if I do not have the cash to support exercise.

In this case I'd be perfectly fine with liquidating at 3:50PM (heck I'd probably exit the majority of the position before that anyway).
TLRY to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀
MAC Feb calls still playing
was paperhanded with my $[BB.TO](https://BB.TO) february 10.50 calls. Sold them at 12 pm when it hit 10.50, was happy with a 90% gain but damn if only i held on to it
Fuck an iPhone, give me that blackberry
If I made 7 million on the stock market I wouldn’t even look at stocks anymore, but I can see why people get hooked
Why the downvotes? I'm loving options.
That’s what I’m wondering
I’m so glad to be apart of this GME squeeze, did my part before close and bought shares and held on to my 17x 1/15 $40 C. Godspeed bois
I have all 2022 and 2023 calls on AMZN, AAPL, CRM, AMD and my account has only gone down the last three weeks. Feel like a clown watching every small cap meme stock blow up 🤡
There’s never a “right” or “perfect” time to have kids. I see this asked occasionally but the reality is that the older you get (especially as you eclipse the 30 mark), the harder it gets to conceive. 

Sure you may shave a few years off your early retirement plans but is that worth the stress of potentially running into physical problems? As an example and not to get too explicit, some women only have one or two days a month to actually be able to conceive and you have to time your business then. 

Main point here is just have them when you’re emotionally set to. Another thing to think about too is the longer you wait, the shorter time in life you’ll be able to spend with them and you don’t want to be like approaching 60 when they’re barely starting college.
Diabolical
I bought @ 20 in December around Christmas, held for as long as I could, but after seeing my bois NIO and Tesla rocket, I couldn't take it anymore. I should have never doubted r/wallstreetbets.
Stop. Go read.

How many GME bears are out there. Don't be afraid to raise your hand
Looking for the same thing. He just need to mention "clean energy" in his speech and I can sleep well tonight.
yes, I think this thing is going to 100s.. Just didn't know it would move so fast haha... been bag holding MVIS :(
GME
Hello, fellow old fart!
Do it and ride this shit to 100+
dealerships can make bank though! Especially if it's in a big money city
Impatience
no room for fomo get back on the rocket
GME is absolutely terrifying right now.  Money is getting made hand over fist, and I'm in it up to my tits, but god damn does it feel like it might end any minute.  BB might be the better play since it just started its pump.
Yeah, if you are under 25k it is def thr way to go. Fuck a day trade. It is your money
Buying a thousand blackberry shares... again
How did your technical analysis know about Taco Bell?  Amazing.
What about the countless local landlords paying a mortgage with rent? The moratorium I can see ending and it will still be on the landlord to evict. At that point they still have to make the financial investment of eviction but also haven’t been receiving payment the last year with a mortgage payment still coming up. And I’m sure there will be punishment for defaulting on a mortgage for which you received relief.
Locked up while you're employed but you should be able to roll the TSP to an IRA after you retire and withdraw any roth contributions without penalty.

BB Options suggestion?
Sorry for coming in to a questions thread on a stock subreddit asking about a stock. But whatever makes you feel like your dick is bigger i guess
Yeah that’s a good point. I don’t have any shares right now so probably a good idea anyway. I’ll wait to see what price it opens at
This was my first investment, I was a bit nervous lol! Wish I went in more, but you can’t get mad at your “un-lived” self.

Not yet, maybe when it goes triple digits.
A friend text me an article that Disney is canceling annual passes and I said “sounds bearish”. They think I’m 🌈 now.
Good god - open the market already . Can’t wait 😂
Everything is going to be audited moving forward, they have bumped out all those involved and are under heavy scrutiny, its not going to happen again.
I likey the shares. My option plays are far more conservative now that I fucked myself repeatedly with bad calls
Yup I sold off TLSS today with a lesson learned, always take profits and don't be greedy.
$10k in calls & $10k in shares. Make me rich tmrw GME 🚀🚀🚀
My limit to sell is at $15,000, I guess it doesn't show up on the order book
😳
Partly true. If we do start selling off, puts will get very expensive. It's better to stay out if you're late to the party, because if the dip gets bought, you're puts will basically get IV crushed in an instant.
Melvin's mom loves bull cock
Are we going to correct/deflate this bubble around the 20th, or just keep pumping till it pops?
Fidelity wont update that after hours (at least for most retail accounts? Maybe it does for bigger ones)
ICLN shares sold, GME shares bought baby 🚀🚀🚀
I think sell the news coz no clean energy in this bill
Fidelity doesn't update price after hours. Look at current bid ask it should be in line with Robinhood
The kid believes he's rich so he is
Mods y’all will ban anybody from the SEC who posts on here, right?

 The second package is expected to be centered on job creation and infrastructure, including hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on clean energy projects like electric vehicle charging stations, along with health care and education spending, Mr. Biden’s team and leading congressional Democrats have indicated.

That's from the NYT Article
After hours you retard
banks and financials, energy stocks (not green energy), and let's not forget BABA who just took a beating and should be coming back strong in the months to come.   
personally I have ENB BNS and POW
I have 3 lol, idk they got filled
Think higher. Unless GME issues a shelf offering, the shorts are fucked, they literally have to offer everyone the price they want.
Give it time. It usually moves slow
I'm interested in volunteering at the humane society or animal shelters taking care of kittens/cats.

Yes,  don’t paper hand this bitch. Run it till the end. I already missed out on my calls earlier this week when I saw red. 1/15 42c @2.15. Feels nice watching strike price hit after hours lol
If you’re questioning buying GME shares at this price:

1. You gay. 

2. You don’t believe in the squeeze.
Most PMs come from Nescacs and Ivies and study liberal arts. Also a lot of ex engineers. Just do CFA or MBA in your late 20s, early 30s

FB settlement?
There's nothing to congratulate him for. We're not in a kindergarten where you can draw any doodle and get a smiley face sticker. He underperformed the market by double digit %%.

And it's not even about stock picks, it's about his mindset. He's saying that he is focused on the latest 30% gain in 3 months like he got it all figured out and it's gonna be 10% per month from now on. Which means that he did not learn the most important lesson.

Thinks that making money is peaking. 19-years-old confirmed.

Wrong subreddit, you have to at least pretend like youre not just gambling here
We aren't an unstoppable force but the mere fact that wsb owned 10% of shares is definitely enough to effect the share price at least a little bit. 10% supply of any asset held by one entity that suddenly decides they are not selling is not nothing, lol.
yes we mooned \~20% and AH was almost 10%
I agree but I guarantee that reddit will fill up with angry people who think IPO's are get rich quick schemes.  Think about how Uber went.  People will loose what they can't afford.

Afaik green energy is part of infra and that’s a separate thing
A guy posts over on thetagang for the most profitable daily option plays each day.  Yesterday it was buying GME 1/15 c 40s at open and getting 4,200% gains if you sold at 1130 am.
Exercise them, both have amazing upside left
Sell the 20c and 35c. Hold those 40c and let run. You’ll be playing with house money on those 40c after you lock in profits. Remember, always play with house money only.
Only fucking regret is I did not buy more. I trust you fuckers more than anything which is dangerous.
Man such an awesome feeling to sleep  peacefully tonight 😀. Congrats

It's a compounding machine. When the price sinks, you sink your dividends into it. When the price is high, you buy other stocks. I know it isn't for everyone but this is the kind of stock that can anchor your portfolio, churning out quarterly dividends that you can invest in whatever other sector you like. XOM could have been had for a 10% dividend yield earlier this year.

When selling a CC or CSP, is there any benefit to analyzing the breakeven price?

I was under the impression that the seller will not be assigned until the breakeven price is hit.

Is the strike price the only thing worth considering? What happens if for example I'm selling a put at strike $18 with b/e $20 due to $2.00 premium and the stock is at $19 at expiry? 

It hasn't happened to me yet, but I want to be ready for when it inevitably does. TIA

Balls deep in 2023 calls. I'm determined to have LUMN make me a millionaire. That being said, I don't think it will go above 20 this year unless they can sell the old Centurylink and continue with the Level 3 business model with a better balance sheet. 

Their 450k miles of fibre is a rock solid asset, so I think this is a very safe play for the moment (at the current valuation). But it's a longer term play, this won't rocket to the moon right away.
Not sure, just trying to ask a question lol
That's assuming every WSB member gets a stimulus check, many of us will not I am sure.
Damn dude if you lost money in the last 8 months you're not playing the game right. It's been a crazy bull market. Hopefully you've changed your fundamentals and aren't just on a lucky streak the last two months.

I’m happy it did print, it got a bit concerning that it was there day after day free falling. But nothing free falls forever, even NKLA (never invest in that company even if my bot says so, it’s on the database). At one point I was going to add it but removed it straight away because I had noticed (it did go up 20% straight after but it’s a really trash company).
thats it im buying BB
Holy fuck GME makes me cum harder than fat ass hoes
Same. I was looking at it on Wednesday at $23 thinking it’s too late. Boy was I wrong.
All you have to say is "I bought GME at $5." and their panties just fly off.
Because they were a penny stock lol. Now they're a solid 9 dollars so I'm pretty sure it should be ok
Indeed!

You sure? The virus was already in US and EU in November 2019. And perhaps as early as March 2019.

Blood donations from Red Cross in the U.S. show that coronavirus was in the U.S. at least in early December 2019

https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1785/6012472

Just because China identified it first doesn’t mean that the virus started in China. And don’t forget that the US media was gloating that democratic nations are better than authoritarian nations in controlling pandemics!
There’s a difference between catching the knife, I think, and buying an asset you believe in, with cash you’re sensibly managing, every time the asset drops another ten percent. I’m not a big investor but I snapped up my first $1500 of crypto this way during the dip.
Yup and now it's been running. Gonna be fun tomorrow. Seems like retail shorts have been climbing in and it's just going to keep cascading the squeeze
> Romance novel lady wearing a sweatshirt w/ a cat on it. Checks out like, 30 romance novels every 3 days.

I was once in the local library while my elementary aged kids were puttering around in the children's section. I was blindly milling around and found myself a few stacks over and there were romance novels, a whole bookshelf, top to bottom, of them. I picked one out and flipped through it. I swear, they were pornography without pictures. They weren't vulgar, per se, but they were very graphic and detailed in the description of what was happening.

Yeah the IV is truly unlike anything I've ever seen. I'm all in on shares, not looking to buy calls at this point. Was just curious because if GME ends tomorrow positive, it seems like it could create another wave of buying going into next week.

Yuck not surprised to see the Fertittas on there they are scum especially Tillman
Ok just FOMOed back into GME for 1.5k shares AH.  LFG 🎢✈🚀
Great example! That's my hope for some of my growth dividend picks I like to call them. Glad to see others thinking this way too.
I’m thinking BB too. I missed it. I was playing gme and riot. Forgot about Bb.
ICLN is going up AH just to dump in the morning
Fair answer. I do actually have LEAPS on GE, as well as one on ZYNGA which I might actually end up regretting if it doesn’t resume it’s previous movement.

My philosophy on trading is buy stocks you believe in. Bought my first stock at 16 with the money I made from cleaning shit. Done Ok, been retiring for the last 12 years.
Nah, they’re embarrassed that what happened with Tesla is happening again with GME. Short squeeze
Honestly, if you’re the type of investor worried about losing money and have trouble holding that mentally, look into stable etf investments
That’s so true
yes, then  i'll cross breed that with a cat-hippo hybrid to create a monippodogcat
What kind of a name is Melvin anyway
New to options trading here.  Would this be a good idea?

Buy a call on BB with a strike price of $8.50, a premium of $0.80, and expiration of 1/15 (tomorrow)?  Break even is $9.30 and current stock price is $9.10.  If the stock goes up 10% I double my money.  Do I have that right?
If we get to 569 like that one DD said I'll be making one 😂
all becky stocks about to moon
I'm assuming because of the low cap
Lmao I know nothing about BB but bought a few $10 calls at the end of day today on a retard whim. After hours looking pretty sweet.
This is not a pump and dump because no one plans to sell
This is what the beginning of a "fire purchase short ass covering margin call" looks like.
honestly tho
GME popping off in AH. Hit a new high.

This has pump and dump written all over it correct?
If that’s true, then nasdaq 40k
Ill be willing to sell Melvin my GME shares, all 16 of em, if he posts a video here of himself fucking an actual pig a la black mirror.
beautiful. it it expires over $40 the squeeze will be even more insane. 90k calls waiting to turn into 9,000,000 million shares.

That's just one strike, if we hit 45 there will be another 100k calls/10 mil shares.

at 55 we tack on another 70k calls.

So if we hit 55, that's 26 million shares that are going to have to be coughed up ~18 million taking into account there's already been delta hedging.

I'm not selling. You're not selling. So where are the shares coming from? Shorts are fucked.

Tomorrow is our lunch time, do not worry
Okay thank you. I promise I'm not trying to be difficult haha, just trying to get a handle on all of this. I appreciate your help here.

So if I'm understanding what I read, selling to close would mean selling my already purchased call for the premium, plus or minus any fluctuation that occurred while I held it, I would take whatever amount that was and close my contract with that person. Whereas, selling to open would suggest that I already have 100 stocks and am writing a contract to sell to a trader?

Final question. Can I exercise my contract at any point or do I have to wait x amount of time?
Seems there is a huge $43 sell wall on GME. Every time it touches 43 it drops.

I will not be surprised if after this GME shit, there will be a bill introduced to prevent regular people from options trading "to protect us"
Because simp has money. Simp simps for daddy maplekaisers approval. Daddy maple has award or some hentai shit I dont actually know
with that much money, I'm just living off low risk interest
GME: I am the Tesla now
That’s my entire portfolio
Right on. Good luck!
Shares are stupid unless you have some good dividend stocks
Quadruple digits
too late for BB?
What your missing is that American airline sucks and is arguable one of the worst airlines. Your better off paying the higher premium for LUV or DAL.
BB calls looking like they have 10-bagger potential
I borrowed a friends car one day that was almost all touch based, driving down the highway and suddenly windshield fogged up. Not the freaking time I need to learn how to find the window defrost setting on a touch screen. 

With tactile controls I can hop in any car and find that know/switch at a glance even in cars I’ve never driven.
Look at the details. Fidelity shows the "last" price as the last price during market hours. To see what it's trading at after hours, look at the bid and ask prices.
Dealing with bs all day. Too late for bb and like,. 50c GME April?
No hate. Just being dramatic

yeah true actually. and im a fan too. ARKG is like 40% of my portfolio.
Me too lost 50% portfolio in 3 months BUT THEN GME GANG SHOWED UP AND IM UP 50% INSTEAD 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
RKT is dogshit, cut the bag
I think it's 7.15 est
IDK, do you like money?

Buy medium, sell high i guess
Fuck yeah, dude. Congrats, that's huge!
Nobody is gonna short anything ever again after this slaughter. WSB just became the biggest MM to watch out for
Both
Damn, idk how retarded you guys are here but I’m in. You austists pumped everything with BB in it even BBY, BBBY, BBD,BBL,BBIO. I fucken love you guys.
Been flying since Jan 1
Of course they don't. 2/19
😂😂😂😂 oh look another hyper! MJ will never be a big bet, look to Canada and how it went there. Total bust.
You could buy up to 55 when I bought my last set of FD c 40's at close today.
Blew my capture card money on more GME stocks
Respect 👊🏻
GME is undervalued as a tech company. $65 PT
of course. Unless you hate money.
Well yeah, its just absurd that the stocks I sell calls on sprocket upwards

I wish it was at least the opposite scenario, where I could get my shares called away for profit with GOEV and retain my shares for BB.....

Shit just sucks playing "safe" strategies this whole week while watching GME gang from the sidelines, and then even my safe plays get blown out when the stocks decide to randomly meme upwards
Please be possible
Biden, I love what you’re doing with the ARK funds, but ima also need you to *specifically* pump TDOC if you really my boy
Hmmm might be poor timing
Thank you~
im in BB for 100 shares. sorry guys, here comes the crash
If I could clone myself.
Nobody tell him.
Thinking of selling some of my ICLN shares to go about 3:2 with QCLN, any thoughts? 

I feel like the money may move more in an ETF with investments like TSLA but it's pricier and I wonder if it won't have has much room to grow in the future...
Yes but I want to do it as early as possible. A young autists  needs his tendies
Earnings still a ways out, I’m holding some March Vales but everything else is June and out.
The BB presentation will be tomorrow during trading hours. Can we trigger a stock halt?

YES! already up to 43 after market
I mean it’s more just an example of the shear numbers we have amassed and out very legitimate effect on the market. I would bet the avg WSBer has more that $1400 in the market. 

We control billions in market dollars.
understandable, I'll prob stick with math though cuz it's really good for job security and sticking out as an applicant, plus if you want to make huge money and become a quant you'll want the math business combo
So many $GME posts to upvote. Congrats to the real 1s the 💎🙌 believers and everyone who contributed  by scooping the dip today be it 1 or 100 shares.
RKT.. biggest shit stain on WSB... Bears and Bulls lost on that shit
If you have had GME since <$20 and you sell you are a MORON.  You know, I know, this isn't even close to over yet, hold strong.
i have regrets selling 40C calls at the low point right before close.
some jan 15 30 calls were trading at 600x on the first squeeze day. so yah you are right actually. just imagine. 600x on your measly $1000 would get you a decent apartment.
Stonks performance will be hampered by Joe Biden’s anti business policies. Facts. Stimmy only good thing.
Can you read?

It's not value. It's a broader group than cocaine.

I wouldn't have thought it was possible to fail to answer such a simple question so spectacularly and so many times, but here we are.

Would you like to try again? Perhaps fourth time is lucky?
This is way more fun than sports betting. $GME $BB
Gloat easily
Love you GME gang. We’ll always have this moment.
Yes
So lets say BB opens tomorrow at $15, you can exercise it before the exp. date and pocket the difference of $6 per contract? I use e\*trade and I have no idea what I'm looking at when I go to the options section.
I'm fucking loading up tomorrow morning.
How come both oil and clean energy are going up? It should be inverse
Lol - yep, 100% aware of the way it works.  On a typical Thursday I wouldn’t play like this but with a stimulus speech later things are either going to the moon or to the core of the earth.  🤷🏻‍♂️
🔥🔥🔥❤️
Birds are not very altruistic
Because grabbing a penny stock after it already mooned never goes poorly
It will only ever will live in the mind. There is literally no benefit that a decentralized currency would bring to the world; especially one with a fixed amount of currency, massively slow transactions and incredibly high transaction costs and energy consumption.  It will never replace the world’s reserve currency because a reserve currency relies on much more than the existence of physical currency. It would also eliminate monetary policy which is a necessary lever to pull or a tool in the toolkit to manage economies.  It would only exist in some revolutionary change to the way we, humans, govern globally.
How’s that going for you?
Legalized gambling you can do while on the toilet
This seems dodge, S3 & a bunch of other posters have provided strong evidence that short interest has INCREASED (inc Ortex predicting a big rise). How are you getting information that they got out half their positions already, essentially invalidating all of these???

You post links to the other stuff but just a pic (could be edited) of Melvin caps positions. Please give source. (sorry if i'm being a douche and it's legit!)
Shut up. All are welcome on this 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I wrote about this very thing yesterday.

&#x200B;

TL:DR:  This sub has a lot more power than you think.
or genius at TA and forecasting
Hahahaha
Very, very, very, very, very little.
The biggest gain today and yesterday happened around noon.  If it dips at open like it did today, I’d hold till noon.
No we are not talking about ports or any other kind of options are warrants or anything else. We are talking about the actual stock why is that so hard to understand
Exactly!!!! The greatest crime to humanity is when we moved away from 90% tax rates.
!RemindMe 74 days to buy ARKX
I'm selling CSPs right now

This bad boy is going to be a wild bucking bronco over the next few months.   I'm not interested in bag holding at $40 when I could get assigned at 15 or 20 and collect sweet ass IV premiums either way.
Oh fuck yeah insider info, thanks. I will trade on this
Who heres tryna YOLO naked brand nkd
Maybe hedge some of your positions and reserve cash for when a correction hits but I definitely don't plan on selling my entire portfolio on positions. on a long enough timeline stonks only go up 🚀
What exactly does MOASS stand for
I see "Pump" and "Money" in the same sentence, next to each other none the less, and I know we're about to moon.
No, it’s what the free market is about
$70 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Boomers got accustomed to the lousy 7% ish per year the market returned in the 2000s, so they're running high on that 10% per year.

They would hit the 13% the S&P has been getting, but you have to subtract 1% of principal to their mutual funds and a couple % more for resolutely holding onto garbage from the 1980s/1990s like KO.
no
There was a 100k sell wall at 40 and I believe 45k at 41
Biden printing another two trillion!!
What are books?
Oh shit fo sho man

My only regret is that I didn’t buy more
Yea. Look up the Volkswagen squeeze

Just gonna run GME until I can afford a tank.  All set then.
Added one more GME share🤡🔥🚀
Next week the MM's are holding high amounts of theta. Be careful out there. If they get theta-squeezed time could start accelerating.
Are you long on this stock? Catalysts could be BNGO level.
This makes no sense. If you have a beta of 2 and the stock is fair valued, then it will move up at twice the ‘speed’ of the market and move down at twice the ‘speed’ of the market. How is that high risk low return? It’s balanced. In this case, beta has nothing to do with it and you are simply saying that is something is undervalued it is a better proposition that something that is fairly valued.
But this one said PUMP MONEY. grandaddy joey is gonna PUMP MONEY😩👀🚀👀😩🚀👀🤷‍♂️🚀
and you hold through the ups and downs

and when you make your gains lend me some for my rent 😂😂
I cannot believe, I paper handed 8 dollar Strike  options I brought Wednesday at close. I got them for 4 dollars and they closed today at 100... AND I SOLD THEM FOR 20!!! With tomorrow rise they probably were 30 baggers. FUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKK WHYYYYY
>marijuana ETFs

any go-to places for research in marijuana? particular stocks/etfs? Thanks
I made an easy 100 bucks off GME today. Bought like 20 shares at open and sold right before the dip. Shoulda held
TSM is going to have another 50-100% year
I got a 9/17 $12c on BB.
I got a confession to make. I’m glad I found this thread 2 years ago. Seems like I personally know you all due to the stupid calls we make 🤡. I love you all & may you all have a great 2021 full of tendies. To my bears pls just become bulls.
TLRY 🔥🔥🔥🚀🚀🚀🚀
It is entirely possible I can make 300k, and you can get similar % returns on your call position. My thesis is not incompatible with a feb/march/april melt-up.
Zacks is 100% a garbage analyst group.
Bought GME 1/15 $46c mostly as a joke.  

They’ll be ITM by premarket.  

What the fuck?
Please GME open at 50 tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I was scrolling through my old GME calls I bought and sold. When GME was down to 13 in December I bought 5 $18c 1/22 and sold them a week later for the smallest gain. They would’ve been worth over 10k if I didn’t have paper hands.
I think you should look at the banking sector if you are looking at it from the long term.  It had a run in recent days from the bottom, but they are undervalued.  I think Alphabet is a good long term bet once the advertising dollars start flowing more after COVID.  Could move more compared to its peers.
mo’ ass
Balls deep in cannabis.
LOL Fast Money saying you need more time on options than 1 day
BB
Eh, I did this correctly right? I bought shares at $35.52. Current share price is $43. I set Stop Loss Sell on Robinhood for $36; so if I wake up tomorrow and the stock plummets to $10 (for example), I would’ve still made a couple pennies because it sold at $36 with this. But if I wake up and it’s at $50 then I still have all my shares. Correct?
Any other sub dollar tickers you think are runners and worth buying now?
I won 500 from a $1.25 slot at the actual casino last weekend. 500 bagger

I agree. But remain hopeful they won’t go too overboard. Mostly cause I want my money from the squeeze of course!

I didn’t see any offering in December. I saw they announced a shelf offering but it doesn’t look like they actually did it - only that they were considering it if needed.

I bought $13 1/15c today thinking today was 1/13. The were $.05 each. Please BB, I need a miracle to save my $25
For some random reason I decided to close the short leg of my 1/22 25/30 debit spreads 2 days ago when GME was at $20. Only cost $0.23 per contract 🤣🤣. Now I just wish I had more than 5. 🚀🚀🚀

Nah we winners tomorrow buddy 🚀🚀

Wish I could tell you, but no timeline here. There's lots of DD on VALE that shed light on all the different metals. Steel is in shortage right now... that's VALE. Iron is heavily needed by China... that's VALE. Nickel is needed so hard as we're at the dawning on the age of the electric vehicle... that's VALE. Everything about this just screams get on it and hold until it doesn't.
I’m saying 100k is a lot going off of a 10/10 or 7/7 and I don’t believe 100k is 7%  for you. 
It’s a massive degenerate gamble call it what you want, saying it’s not is a lie and you know it.
Bee bee eye too
$SENS is looking like a good buy.

Hold over the long weekend and sell mid-next week.

Don't miss this one, guys! That volume is climbing.

If you sell ICLN for GME, you were never a believer in the first place and hoped on simply cause of this sub. Not that you won’t make money on GME of course.

Everything you said is wrong, but other than that, great post.
If you are looking at that now I doubt that will be the price at open since BB is up 13% in after hours trading

Did you sell the top? You should have scalped a quick day trade. It was pretty obvious when it went over 40 that it would come back down. I'm out of day trades till tomorrow so rip me but it was fun to watch
I'm jealous of smart people in WSB those expecting GME short squeeze and take massive gains.

I was not smart enough to understand that really happen, that's why I'm poor I guess.

thank you for your service

How was ICLN at $50 in 2008 and never recovered until now?
It's honestly painful too read all these entitled, rude and "bragging" comments. No one cares if you've made $1000 in a month, you're on the internet so you basically don't matter and what you say is not true xD

Instead of being dickheads be constructive, give tips, be happy for OP. Everyone learns at different speeds and ways. Hell I can't be bothered to read books or listen to annoying peoples pods learning the stock market.   
I watch a few, very few YouTube channels and then learn by doing and hanging on this reddit and checking out companies that interest me.
In reference to your past comment tho, they wouldn't have to cover puts because this shit is sky high now. What are you saying they would need to cover in regards to puts if the price is up
Pls BB don't.. Don't that much. I wanna fly with yoou
Insane and news was out last week and lot of chatter over the weekend

Huh, look at that, a week earlier.

Look, DFV has supposedly made 5 million bucks or whatever, which is far more than I ever made, so awesome for him. I wish I'd had the brains a year and a half ago to be tracking Burry, but I'll try to learn now rather than never.
It's okay I bought some on open and they were up 35% a few minutes later then I sold them for -5% a few minutes after that lmao. Just buy stock
What’s the MOST shorted stock??!!
It sounds like you are both responsible adults, so I'm sure you will figure it out. If having children is important to you, you should plan accordingly but not let financials completely dictate when you start.


Especially if you both plan to have more than 1 child, timing is very important (ie. Don't have them too late in the game). Of course there are lots of pros to starting a family later (more financial, emotional, and psychological stability) but unfortunately biologically it could be an issue. Not everyone gets pregnant right away, although hopefully that won't be an issue for you and your SO.


I have friends that ideally wanted 3 children, but due to poor planning in regards to timing, will ultimately not get to their ideal number of children.


Just a different perspective. Children will definitely set your FIRE date back and likely inflate your FIRE number. However, if children are important to you, it shouldn't hinge entirely on your financials. 


Good luck :)!

I understand that take. For me personally I work for my family’s business. It’s very successful and I have a path ahead of me in terms of growth. However I absolutely dread it. I never felt the freedom of discovering my own path and have decimated my 20’s from working 55 hours a week.

True. You could even help it if you convert that 300k into calls and shares at EOD tomorrow. I will never short a meme stock personally, that’s too risky for me

Wise words right there, indeed. I kinda want to ride my 20c one thouch, it’s such a beauty. At what point does it stop making sense in terms of it being “too much ITM” already? Still discovering all of these options
This is the way.
I should've embraced the tism when i had the chance
Growth stocks this year might not be as explosive as last year. Just my 2C though, if you have leaps then you are fine. The theta decay is low enough

Dont forget meat alternatives. BYND boomed today. My $140 1/15 calls went up 1000% lmfao.
GME is gonna easily break through 50 tomorrow 

I'm biased having bought in at 19 but GME and BB seem like the tickets to the moon if you ask me and my portfolio that doubled in the last 2 days
you guys can sleep?
Well you’re definitely in the right place, being this retarded

Byedon better not go light on the stimulus/infrastructure. To hell with budget deficits, that ship sailed the last 4 years. Its Keynes or bust baby, open the check book!
Yeah cause that works! Retard
Would it be better to buy shares first thing in the morning or now?
Mother of all serious shrimp

I never worked in a coffee shop, but the food service jobs I had always had a nasty, gross part to them. Things like, "Your turn to clean up the bathroom, and looks like the toilet is clogged again." A lot of wiping down tables, sweeping up the floor, cleaning the stuff behind the counter, cleaning up customer puke one time.

And that's to say nothing about the other fun stuff like having to come in early to open, or stay late to close. Or having to deal with customers.
Better add BB shit is mooning AH & tomorrow.
You haven’t missed GME yet.

GME is the fountain of youth but with money. Why would you not be in?
Depends on the setup but from 5 to 30
There’s rumors on the details of this stimulus going around on the articles
$15 was the minimum wage ask in 2010 it should be $20 now.
Assuming there is some to buy..
It is not too late
I listed them in here but BANT is about .009 and a lot of people think it will go over $1, with it's DOD contracts.  It was a$3 stock at some point.
Also TSNP should move higher next week
Never be sad about what could have been. That's for when you actually lose money. Then you can feel shit.
congrats...keep it up
Frankfurt school gonna go bankrupt
"Hey guis should I buy stonk that just went up 100%? Y/N?"
It’s win win
Up another 6.7% AH... I'm hoping for $50 by next week
 bought shares for VDRM and OZSC yesterday. 

Wasn't a good day for me.
You're making history bro. I wish I had jumped on the gme train earlier but my dumb ass chose NIO instead
GME stock soars while cucks over at /r/dividends trying to figure out if they get dividend from fractional shares.
Now kiss me!
Sounds brutha, hopefully the squeeze happens soon so I can cash out and get in on this golden ticket 🎫
I'm pretty good at trading. It's not a huge position for me.

Burry is invested in $LUMN. The next GME fool.  Don’t miss out!!  3/19 $12.5c still cheap!!
Itll either stay flat or drop
If you combined this with stock borrow cost i think it would be quite effective, I would imagine you see spikes in borrow costs for most short squeezes.
Who is in on this ACB squeeze? Price target?
Honestly think I’m going to move my 93 shares of PLTR at open tomorrow into some BB for the culture
Wait for open and play it from there, but I know I’m gonna buy.
Pretty sure people expected Obama to do a lot more for the green energy than he ended up getting done.

We have taken so much in profits my entire account could burn tomorrow and I'd be up 5x.
So is it now time to jump in for long term?
WSB ETF hahaha
I would DCA that 20K in increments of 4K monthly or something like that. Spread that risk out a bit more in the near term, you never know what can happen in a bull market propped up by stimulus
See you in tendie town brother
It's just getting started
I agree with you 100% in that AA sucks, but I think people easily pick lower cost+ convenience with flights rather than service quality. It's about getting from A to B as fast and cheaply as possible at the end of the day
Hop on GME train, guaranteed money
All u gotta do is wait until earnings
Yup..

You can look at previous comments in this and the posts prior and see what people say. 

It’s not really up to me about how long it turns over (you can look at previous posts and most of it just kept saying FDX, and BYND, and that just rocketed after free falling.  

There was another company with a L in its name (I know it’s not helpful but there’s a lot of tickers I go through so it’s kind of hard to keep track. Same applies as above.
in order to buy an option u need a seller. why would anyone sell u a $0 option when the only movement possible on it is up?
Hey everyone,

I recently tried individual stock picking, and I am thinking that probably isn't for me. I think instead I want to DCA into VTSAX and then choose just a couple of different ETFs to get more specific exposure. I know the ARK ones are super popular right now, and I heard a lot of people talking about QQQ or ICLN. I am thinking of trying to have money there for 5+ years, hopefully even longer. What would be some of your recommendations?

TIA
Yeah I think there's a good chance this rides into next week before any sort of correction. Think the only question is how high it goes tomorrow before profit taking halts the ride.
Look at the 10 year chart for IWM lol. This is going to end in tears
Sorry to ask but I don’t have options broker. Would you recommend stocks of psth currently? Any idea on possible after merger values?
That’s 70% of my portfolio. I was thinking I should make a leap to stocks and then made this dumb decision :p
Is Melvin also shorting GME in addition to owning those puts? i.e. they doubled down on their short position with this stock?

This explanation only holds weight if they also shorted the stock.
Its not as exhausting as losing
Little, but it fucked me all day long
It’s already getting close to 11 rn, wouldn’t be surprised if it hits 15 tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Alright folks. I threw 30k into GME shares this morning. Put 100% of my wife's IRA into GME shares. Holding 2000 shares all together now. Unfortunately, because of COVID, I don't think I can evict my wife's boyfriend yet.
Just after we got married in our mid-20s, I sat my beautiful wife and I down (she was reluctant) to map out some 10 year projections - life, work, family, wealth and so on. Not so it was set in stone - just so we had some plan to work towards, and adjust if better options came along.

That one sheet of paper got filed, we moved overseas for a couple of years (which had been one of the plan options!), and I found it about 7 years later when we moved back 'home' to start a family. The specific form of how we would grow wealth had changed - we were more property-savvy in our 20s, and also underestimated how fast those values would grow - but the results were incredible.

We were both earning more than we had hoped. And despite largely putting our finances on hold for 2 years while travelling, our Net Worth was almost exactly what we had forecast it to be at that time. (We ended up smashing the 10 year goal out of the park, because we were far cleverer in our 30s.)

That exercise, and then seeing how it paid off IRL, was really important for us. As you say, it gave us the real world proof that our optimistic planning could create tangible results. And that made us more confident to aim higher!

Thanks for sharing.
Clean energy has been down or flat all week tho besides PlUg
You can’t do that. Hitler isn’t a part of us anymore
Yikes I did not see that 3 pm sell off
Not too late! My word of advice is wait 15 or 20 minutes after market opens to decide if it’s a good time to enter. 

Also shares are taxed less if you hold for a year! More money in the long run.
You didn't buy to close that position when the squozening began?  I had 25 strike covered calls of my shares too for 1/15.  I closed them shits yesterday morning the minute it broke through 24 and started looking mean and angry upwards.  Took my little 10k beating on that and made 100k on the shares I kept.
There are moments when i'm happy that i'm not an American taxpayer.

Thanks, guys! We'll just skim off them tendies... sorry about that.
I think what he means is they'll have the hardware to then transfer over, not just interchange software at will. They have some upgrades on their hardware in the pipework I believe.

Me? I'd just buy a REIT.

That said, I don't really see a reason to hold REITs over equities. There is a small amount of REITs in VTSAX.
I’m in 12C , but IV going to be high af tomorrow
Hey if it makes you feel better I sold 16 DDD calls yesterday for a $500+ loss at 0.15ea. They closed at 3.00 today missed out on $4800 overnight :/
Azul has been my highest gaining airline.  Wish I would have had more to invest on it at the time, but got in at $9 per share, it’s up to $22.  I also bought some Delta and United, which are both up around 70%.
I'm thinking of buying 29/1 $11.5C BB tomorrow morning. Counting on big settlement news.
Should I sell TNXP now (after hours) or tomorrow. I’m up like 4.5% but I don’t wanna risk dipping tomorrow and losing money. Any suggestions?
How do I buy tickets for the opening performance???
WSB should have it's own ETF hahaha
Looks like Tlry is starting to move too.
It’s mooning AH
I can feel it in my bones
Everything put PLTR. fml
Thanks for this info, send like I'm in on GM for the long hold.
LONG LIVE $BB!  


I'm maximizing my profits!
Right, and QCLN has a lower market cap actually. I think it's more psychological to me that it'll feel like it's not growing as much? I admit that my concerns aren't practical...

It's not even gonna be targeted by congress
Hey can you explain exactly how to do this with $50 BAC calls?
“How I invest my money”
It just came out a couple months ago and I’m half way through it. It’s a collection of what money pros do with their own personal money and investments. It’s not bad and basic in terms of what they talk about and funds. [how I invest my money](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2020/11/13/how-i-invest-my-money/)
It's past 40 post market brother. Fuck tendieland, we are going to tendie planet
Steel, GME, and ICLN all up after hours. I can only get so erect
I lost 1k on testla today when I was up 1k at some point that’s the way it goes
Anything for the cause
stonks
Where do you get these infos?
Have you factored in the risk that no dividend is paid, and that the equity tanks 50% in value, so your yield falls off a cliff...? If you are getting paid 9% above risk free rate then you are getting paid because you are taking risk.
People used to hate watching other people play because most other people were shit at the game so it wasn't entertaining. You see these streamers that are ridiculously good at games, and that's entertainment for many.
The first season was so innocent.

That was the best decision I ever made. Made back all my profits from PLTR 40c 12/4 day now it’s green pastures. Welcome aboard comrade *taps head shaping helmet*
They sold like 90 patents to Huawei, they are moving into a more software driven company and cyber security w/ integration for MS, IBM, VMWare. Not to mention licensing out their tech
As soon as their stocks go up they’ll just dilute it again and screw us

You’re right!

I'm down over 50000 on that one alone, yes I know i'm an idiot
hopefully model s/x refresh and model 2 will be a catalyst to moon to $1000
Bought 10 to help the cause and hold the line!
So as someone on the verge of homelessness, is BB saving me tomorrow?
How many shares of bb tomorrow?
Haven’t looked, probably not my cup of tea, just saying be careful with penny stocks at ATH, many end up back as penny stocks rather quickly

Yo- it doesn’t matter if you bought a fractional share or 10,000 shares of GME. 

Us Autistic Degens are holding together.  It’s beautiful. 

You can take our 🌈🐻 but you’ll NEVER take our virginity!!!
to the guy who suggested the BB stock bumped every b stock,  bby, bbby, ect , AI is trading and making money to be skynet
What time is biden speaking
That won’t be the premium when the market opens.
How much now?
GME made us millionaires, but PLTR will make us billionaires.
Jesus christ dude....

Same though
maybe 55 but still tendies
9 billion being dumped on cybersecurity and IT with PLTR already holding gov. contracts  is this the catalyst that sends them straight to tendy town.
Don't forget about hexo
Here. June calls. 30+ by then
GME opened up around 6-8 dollars above close today. So 48-50 isn’t that far off.
Everyone in here holding shares lately? This is not the wall street bets I grew up on. GAY
That's a lot of work to get the same inevitable 2-3% raise as everyone else and maybe 1% more if you're really really good.
44 is like the last gap up based on prior levels. Once it breaks that, there's no technical basis for resistance, it's just going to fucking run till we destroy the entire global financial system
What does IOT mean?  
I read that as, " THAT IS SOME **Iye Of the Tiger** level of tech and it will be huge."  
I know it's wrong but it feels right so, I'm going with my retarded interpretation.
When do you guys decide to buy leaps instead of shares? I usually use options for short term plays & buy shares for a long term hold
VALE, I never doubted you (well maybe a little). 52 week highs after hours on good volume. Let’s hope Joe announces massive infrastructure spending tonight and steel gang can live large tomorrow. MT looking good too.
good times
No puny, soft, squishy little 💎s here, these are pure DFV hands - hardest fucking substance known to man.
That was truly beautiful. Enjoy your flair.
Well then. Finance with some sort of software/comp engineering minor would pair well with the future of fin tech. Just make sure you YOLO that $1600 instead of buying things like food.
Thanks fam
How long are you holding for?

Long hold. Affirm will be disruptive.
Looking good so far:

BB to hit $100
I'm guessing that Vanguard is using the term risk in the sense of classical financial theory, specifically the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).  In this model the risk of an asset is roughly equivalent to the volatility of its price, and you can see from looking at the historical time series of S&P 500 prices that it often experiences very dramatic swings over short periods of time.

The question is: does this definition of risk matter to you as an investor?  The answer is yes.  If your time horizon is short, then it matters because a high volatility stock could lose you lots of money that you need.  Risk, in this case, is bad.

If your time horizon is long, then you care about this notion of risk because you want to take more of it!  According to the CAPM, higher risk assets generate greater returns over the long run - for instance, we predict that bond returns will be lower than stock returns on average _because they are less volatile_.  High long-term returns are the reward you get for tolerating more volatility.

So that means you should put all your money in Bitcoin because that's one of the most volatile assets out there, right?  No, not necessarily: not all volatile assets have positive expected returns.  For a single stock or currency there are too many stupid random things that could happen that would kill your returns - Tesla is great, but what if Elon Musk gets hit by a bus?  The only way to protect yourself from that kind of risk is diversification: own hundreds or thousands of volatile stocks, and then it's nearly impossible that all of them will get unlucky.

So that's how you can reconcile the lingo.  Vanguard says that the S&P 500 is risky because it's volatile, and /r/investing says that the S&P 500 is safe because it's sufficiently diversified that we can reasonably expect to be compensated over the long run for tolerating its volatility.
Futures gonna be fun to watch tonight with Buyden’s speech.
TLRY, AAL, GME & NKLA TO THE FUCKING MOON 🚀🚀🚀

Wife says she doesn't use that much any more either so maybe the growth just isn't there.
My options always star ship
Man I’d go yolo it and then it would tank. I should’ve gotten in a couple days ago for the fresh tendies. Imma stick with BB.
I've got 2 4/16 18c VALE calls. What's happening in Feb? I'm a paper hand bitch with anything not gme.
Guys my wife is in for 5k at an average of something like $58 a share from too many years back. She might be an original autist
Good. IRA is the sideline.
Get out?  The rocket is still fueling you rainbow bear. $30 minimum.  If we can get bankrupt GME to $30+ we can sure as hell get BB that is about to explode into car AI to $30+.
Sadly yes. No sight of ICLN in stimmy tonight probably.
I have 230€ in my spending account and 84k€ in GME shares
what do I buy at open? GME calls for the weekend? BB calls? I need some more free money guys
Going to diamond hands the shit out of these BB 9.5c 1/22s

"I've made 2$ this Month!"
Hey, just going to throw an idea out there: for slow-moving, steady dividend payers, selling covered calls is a way to generate a little extra money.  

I'm doing that with AT&T right now.  I sell out-of-the-money call contracts that are higher than my average buy-in price.  It's a no risk strategy that can add a few percent in yield.
Ticker: RTRD
$1000 emergency fund then work on your debt. Investing is pointless when you’ll just eventually use that to pay back all the interest occurred while waiting for your investment to get bigger
This is why you hold the line. GME GANG RISE UP
As long as we don't sell shares for the bears to cover their shorts. They need millions of shares to cover their shorts 

They are royally fucked. Don't sell
Steel. Infrastructure will be the only thing biden can don't I bring us together. Watch.
lol imagine being dumb enough to short anything in this market. Looking at Melvin Capital. Let alone loosing \~15% from inflation and the short squeeze.
Hold GME over the long weekend or exit tomorrow EOD?
Pelican room is buying up SPCE
Both, and since ur new buy shares
I just saw a Lucid commercial... CCIV to the moon? Never seen a Tesla commercial, just saying.
Good luck getting that premium on that call on a day where the stock will never even get close to $8.50. Buy calls farther out.
Then he makes the mic that Obama dropped after is last speech fly from the ground into his hand and gives a middle finger to Isaac
Somewhere in between. Can definitely see it getting there but with how popular it's  been and people treating it as if it's not an ETF IDK 100% Last year it would have been an easy call.
Bro that’s why it hurts 😭😭. I never pick winners so the first time I had a real powerful position, I choke :(
Congress = Bicameral

House + Senate = Congress

I've been trying to figure out what I will do in 10 or so years when I hopefully retire early.  10 years is plenty of time for me to slowly find an interesting open source project to get involved in.  Whether I try to monetize that in retirement or just continue to be involved as a hobby would depend on how much effort I really want to put into it.

I guess it is time to start looking through open source projects to find an interesting one.
thx do you think it can impact the market if its positive
nah we need ppl to hold to 100+
appreciate it and great username
Us 40 year olds are Gen X dumb ass.

Oh APHA the piece of shit is finally doing it.  I was on and off that train already over a month ago when it was weed stock time after the election.  It just sat there looking stupid.  Now it wants to go wild.  I see how it is.
I just want you all to know I bought a BB $10c for 12/4 on December 1st. 

It expired worthless. Ahead of the curve 😎
GI-K JUST HIT 17.00 AH, moon tomorrow 🚀
By that Logic Half my portfolio is full of better companies than Apple. Arconic is up 270% since i bought them in may. Guess they are the superior company.
I'm positively retarded, so please explain where I've got this wrong:

Melvin Capital borrowed 5 million shares, and sold them, but have the obligation to return those shares at the end of the contract term. Right? That's how they make money, they expect the price to go down, so they can buy back the stocks at a lower price than they sold them for at the start of the contract. Right?
It does make sense. Yes, the stock moves at "twice the speed" of the market as you said. The point is that when it reaches it's fair value you no longer expect it to continue to do so. It's reached the value you placed on it, there's no fundamental reasons to believe it will continue to increase. That's where the high risk low reward comes in. It only takes place when the stock reaches it's fair value, because at that point it shouldn't, in theory, continue to go up with a bull market because it's at its fair value, but in a bear market it will still have it's high beta loss at "twice the speed" of the market. Making it high risk and low reward

Seriously Joe, just say something like “We will be expanding Telehealth programs to help finish the fight against COVID and provide our citizens who may be scared to leave the home in these dark times, adequate levels of health care. These programs have proven to be popular, with both doctors and patients, and they should be utilized to their fullest extent.”
How is this shit up past 40 when even 5 years ago it wasn't near that?
RemindMe! 1 year how’s the progress?
He announced a stimulus package. So that should help
ok, maybe it was old news or false. i read about it a while ago.
This would be the case if they were out of the money. If they're in the money, usually the broker will autoexercise (providing the trade is profitable), bankroll the whole transaction and put the left over profit into your account.
I’m sorry to hear buddy, having held winners hurts way more then FOMO
7:15 est
good to know.  Thanks!
How high will BBBY go?
Range day? Selling a 0dte straddle.

You won’t have to wait that long it’s hitting 50 tomorrow for sure
They will hold until they get fucking margin called then they will deposit more money then get margin called again then finally give up. Steve Eisman literally lost like a billion shorting Tesla and Ackman also lost like a billion shorting Herbalife. They just don't know when to fucking quit

What does corsair innovate? I made some tendies on them after sir_jack moved in, but don’t know anything about them. Their website looked like pretty ordinary, although badass, gaming equipment. 

Are they inventing new things or changing the way people game somehow?
What is your FIRE number?
Hope you liked today's dip 😛
55c 1/15's sold for .59 right before close. Is it better to sell at open or set a limit at something higher (or lower)? Bought at .35 earlier in the day to catch a spike but phone died for a few hours away from a charger and I missed the $2+ window (was an idiot and didn't set a limit).
Correct.  I can sell it at anytime provide there are buyers but yes, I would essentially profit off the diff.

I’m predicting a quick dip at open and then 🚀 again after people panic sold their shit.
Post an update!

As long as he mentions the other kind of green as well...

My APHA tendies could get a little more crispy.
ARKG up 5% on the day even with one of its biggest holdings (TDOC) taking a hit.
yes just like $TSLA
I couldn't really see anything about clean energy in the bill. Did I miss something?
Definitely ! I don't know what I would like to do but a hundred percent I am going to "work" for fun. I am probably 20-30 years away from retirement.  I won't ever not "work" a small part time gig or volunteer thing. in my experience  everyone who has full blown retired and haven't had something to do aren't active and they just lose it / are unhealthy and pretty unhappy. I think people need a job personally, this is just my two cents.
Fuck them, no evidence that increasing the minimum wage causes jobs to drop significantly.

Only if you feel tilting MSFT is worth it. Personally, I love MSFT due to my profession, but what do I know, I’m just a random dude on the internet.

If I recall, Vanguard’s white paper recommends 20%-40% with lower bonds yielding best benefit for decreasing volatility: https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGGEB.pdf

Since you’re already with the admiral shares, VXUS/VTIAX gives good developed and developing exposure.

Whole thing is an age old debate, but for me it comes to betting on the world over the U.S. alone.

Well they have holdings worth 20B in total, even if they have to cover every single share in existance of GME at 40$ that would only be a 12.5% hit.
1/2 GME shares the other half BABA June 235 calls.  Until the wheels fall off.

I came in with low expectations and left blown away. Not bad, not bad at all. Upvote for you fellow Chad.
fml...I saw some bullshit news that TLRY would be merged with APHA at 10 price point. So, I sold my 10/40 spreads that I abought about $1 each. Could have been 10 bagger now
If you had 19k would you put it all on $BB? I just downloaded RH and want money.
You're the entire volume of that call 😂

I'ma put in some orders for LEAPs tmr too, hopefully someone will sell them to me
George would post loss porn every week on here until one day he does... THE OPPOSITE.

What's the ticker? I'm not seeing origanigram on anything
Yeah I get that psychological element. Good luck homie

on gme? If you time it right, you might be able to average down and hope for a run way past what you need. it's a 3 day weekend. Shorts have to start covering sometime and hopefully they start tomorrow.
I was stupid to buy ICLN instead of GME or BB and now Biden is cucking us by not including clean energy in his plan, great.
Please, for the sake of your PP, don't buy calls now. Shares should be good but the ride will go up AND down so keep your arms and legs safe from any danger. But the IV is brutal for a reason. If you think the squeeze will happen then buy shares. If you have time (months/years) buy shares. Calls can easily reduce your PP by one or two digits.
I hope to be you one day
There's definitely going to be a painful restructuring. I live next to NYC and small businesses have been decimated. It'll come back eventually with new businesses and new owners. But until then the small business sector is going to be in really bad shape.

I keep seeing this expectation and I’m not sure why. Is it basically just because of the democratic senate? I got 50 shares this week but thinking about more.

your fine lol
Dropping my (Han)cock on this
You should buy shares. 

A call is where you’re buying the rights to 100 shares and basically you’re gambling on the possibility it will go up to a certain amount by a certain date. Rocket potential upside and catastrophic potential downside (if it doesn’t reach what you predicted it would, you lose 100% of it, and it goes down quickly if you guess wrong). Also, once the rocket has initiated liftoff, you e pretty much missed the possibility of making a profit on calls. 

TLDR: buy shares until you’re ready to go full R.
Yah i'm trying to figure out what's driving the movement, I just hope it holds until monday
They are a security company now

Youre not wrong, but I made my fair share on gme already and cashed out (600% gain or so)
Why is VIX up
This is the way
Anyone know what to make of POWW (Ammo)? They’ve had a string of promising catalysts the last few days, jumped up to an all time high and have now come back down.  Keep holding on or dump it now and cut losses?
That’s gonna land way in the money. Did you pick them up cheap?
my call is from december 23rd! i bought a 25c @ 1.85 and saw it drop to .20 last week. After all that red IDGAF if I settle at 22.00 or 16.00.
oh gotcha
Disneyland announced today they are cancelling everyone's annual pass. Could be the bad news that caused a dip
Bought some calls about two hours before close, not disappointed, already up👍🏻
Zima? Or Zomething Different?
I always back away from betting on you guys but I decided after missing GME to buy 350 shares of BB...Let’s gooooooooool 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yea keep dreaming. Retail investor made it through so many bubble pops throughout history.
Why isn't this in the news everywhere yet?
Congrats! This is an exciting step.

If you can, before leaving your company I’d rollover your IRA into your company 401k to take advantage of the IRS rule of “55”. It allows you to withdraw from your current company’s 401k, after separating, after you turn 55. The key is it needs to be in that company’s 401k when you leave. Otherwise you’ll need to wait till 59.5 to withdraw from your IRA without penalty. Unless of course you’re planning on performing a 72t to pull the money out beforehand.
So generalizations are ok if it's backed up by personal experience. Cool!
GME
Any of my 30+ bros remember the GTA San Andreas release

Pretty sure my mom drove me there at 11pm to stand in line to get that shit at midnight

Ended up in line next to my weed dealer too, mom had no idea 😎

GME to the fuckin moon 🚀🚀🚀
Positive on Nikola? Tf?
ARCT been shitting the bed too
GME is the way
Yeah, that one looks familiar
I don’t stay long in any stock but do keep a a a few if it grows further in the future.
So, the 11.40 is the price got the contract at. So lets say he has 1 contract w strike of 11.40 100 x 11.40 == 1140.

Current price is 40ish. So the 100 is now x 40. 100 x 40 = 3000. Multiplied by the number of contracts he had. Thus, the insanity. Essentially he placed a bet in April that the price would be at least 11.40. Its 40. He bet 70k on that. Now hes a multi millionaire. Balls of steel.
Yah pretty week price action considering the stimulus package he’s already announced 😕
Damnnn, whats your price target?
Pump money, could be talking about hookers, they need tendies too
IM JUST FEARFUL AFTER NIO AND PLTR, HELP ME. SAVE ME FROM THIS HELL
BB, BBBY, or more GME calls with these 1/15 profits?
Yes. Yes it does. Having a rough day over it if I only I held one more day lmao it’s ok though someone’s comment like this helped me earlier. Their is always another play and another chance
wait, so calls on RC?
The shares are what squeezed the short
MELVIN WILL REGRET THIS
shouldve held my gme calls smh, still profited though and switched to shares
it gassed, so it's going to brake and dip according to e-40
GME is Not dipping.  The math just isn’t there.  This is not a normal rally/hype.  It was a momentum thing.  It’s now becoming a squeeze within the next week.  


This doubling in under 48hrs has made all shorts unprofitable.  It doesn’t matter where they entered.  


Short seller’s peak profit happens if a stock goes to $0.  No one expects GME to be at $0 even in the next few years.  But assuming it could a month from now, let’s do the maths. 


Most shorts got in around $15 or less.  That means the most they can make is $15, **IF** GME goes to $0 (it won’t). 


Now any time you borrow anything, you have to pay interest on it, this includes shares.  The current interest rate is 45% (or higher).  The interest is on the price of the current shares, not the price they bought in at.  


This means on a share price of $40, they are paying nearly $0.60 a day to short it.  Doesn’t sound too expensive right? Until you realize that in less than 25 days, they will have paid more in interest than they could ever gain, even if GME went to $0 in February. 


Keep in mind, once a short seller realizes it is literally impossible to make money, they just need to time their exit.  Since this is a stampede of short sellers, the best time to exit is right away.  They literally can’t wait 3 weeks, or else they might as well paid $12 more a share (from the interest they’re going to accrue).  


Keep in mind, this is all voluntary covering.  There are also tons of accounts out there that will now have to cover due to margin calls and such.  


Keep in mind that 71 million shares are shorted.  That’s more than are technically available.  


Keep in mind that 20% of shares are locked up by Cohen & such, who cannot sell for a few more months.  So that leaves even less shares for the shorts.  


Once most of the shorts cover (within 3 weeks), the price won’t drop overnight.  They have to buy more shares than available and anyone left holding shorts will still be buying.  And by that time, a new base & support level should have been established.
Never will I doubt his next move(s).
That bitch is printing hard rn, people will wish they got in tomorrow lol

You're thinking of Citron having a high return with 20% of capital. Melvin has 7B (its on wiki), but I think you do raise a good point!
I haven’t shopped at GameStop in years because of their terrible trade in value for games, but now they’re making up for it

Do you have to be approved by Robinhood in order to be able to trade options? The broker I use just denied me...
GME sells Fun Co pops whose ticker’s market cap is too small to mention but my 2/19 $7.50c on this little figurine maker have been running hot.
I've only 53 and rest in BB gain is gain all the way, build that and 🚀🚀🚀🚀 all the way!!
Same here... up 1% today
I have options too.  What happens to those?
You know what I meant 🤡
LUMN looking like it could be a play.
Also tempted to FOMO into BB tomorrow
Yea! I've been hearing about it lately. I might be trying it out. Personally, going to stick with webull for at least a couple months to give it a shot.
I’m NOT looking forward to the 3 day weekend
Are you smiling?
You retards have gotten me addicting. GME 🚀🚀🚀LESSGO
This is me right now after this bowl
29 SPY $285c 1/15
so, I'm sitting here all happy about the fitbit deal because I bought cheap calls a few months ago, but then I realized.. "wait, I don't have that kind of luck".. those shit are going to just evaporate, right?  now does that shit work?
Every stock with high short interest is squeezing. I’m pissed they’re all going up and I can’t jump in all of them.
yeeee bebe. slow and steady but still bleeds my calls dry! just enough for the tease
Don't matter. It's coming and today ICLN was red so tomorrow it'll rebound. 2 red days would make no sense at this time.
0dte calls intra-day movements are crazy, and with GME we only go to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
more pltr calls I guess
GM?

Don’t fall for p & ds. That company you mentioned has changed its name twice in two years and has had 3 CEOs in four years. It also has a shifting business model since it can’t seem to figure out how to make money.

Naw but my bad. I just thought you were shitting on him for no reason.
Mostly because of the Robinhood outages and I'm doing more options so that's always nerve racking.
Why are people so hard, is everyone here a typical hedge fund manager who thinks only they can trade stock!? Seriously the bois at wallstreetbets are 100x nicer than ppl in this thread. This thread surprised and disappointed me.
Yeah, I like to think I would chuck most of it into a Vanguard boomer fund as a set and forget - but I’m not sure I could help myself
This is probably the first time **in history** that retail traders are bending over hedge funds. 

All you have to do to make tendies is buy GME shares, and hold until after Melvin's puts expire. 

It's that easy. Get paid.
When you want a long term hold but your broke af and can’t afford more than a handful of shares but have just enough to buy 1 contract
Gme has a trend of surging then dumping right after open. I'd give it an hour after markets open before committing to any large positions

Been holding 1000 shares of APHA since early December which is pretty much the same thing at this point.
“But this week he saw CNBC’s Jim Cramer talking about GameStop. He decided to purchase roughly 80 shares of the company for slightly more than $20 apiece at the opening bell Wednesday”
They have the same stock symbol as I do. I bought them last week too.
I’m dealing with this now and it is incredibly annoying. My last paycheck of the year saw a “bump” of $7500 from the cost of movers and all that, and then the estimated additional taxes withheld of 1300 or so. Between this, working in two states for exactly 50% of the year each, some cap gains, and bank account churning I might genuinely hire a tax person this year instead of using software.
Yes
You guys. At some point we have to think about another sub Reddit to throw under the bus if the SEC comes for our GME pump.
What the fuck does this mean? Looks like the calendar I track for days I jerk off.
Yeah I gotta learn the greeks too! I said fuck it and bought 10c for 1/22z. Hoping the news and WSB pumping it makes it go to 12 tomorrow
Nothing reacted to that announcement...
I want to let GME gang know that I have about 1k in calls tomorrow that I'm letting ride all day. Either getting rich or letting them expire worthless. No selling my dudes. FINISH HIM.
Paydays tomorrow boys, gonna reload 😎
Who said that
They dropped the deets already yeah

Beautiful champ. I’m tired of this up in AH then instantly down when the market opens shit with extra volatility

If there's one thing you can set your clock to, it's GME gapping up after hours and then getting beat back down after open.  Even with the squozening happening, some things never change.  I bought 30 more 1/15 c 40's at 3:58 today knowing that I get more free money at 9:30 tomorrow.
I’d noticed the same.

Those calls, which he’s been holding for fucking ever, were out of the money at the beginning of the week and he was still holding them. He still has a thousand 4/16 calls. This motherfucker knows more about risk than you and I put together... it’s either that or his brain literally does not recognize the very concept of risk. 

I’m kind of offended on his behalf that you are doubting any decision he makes at this point. This man is CLEARY infallible.

MJ is the ETF which IMO has room to grow, i'm just worried about it's rate of growth because it's an ETF. 

ACB just had a really good day and has room to grow. Same for HEXO. 

CNTTQ is my underdog, I wouldn't rely too heavy on them but who knows.
I dont know how much Elon k9is paying you guys to post this every month, but you could make more. ask for more next time.
Been in for about 2 weeks and I can see OPTI hitting $1 100%. The 2B contract gives the company 100M in profit. At a modest PE ratio of 15, OPTI should be trading at nearly a dollar. And of course most companies these days trade far above that ratio. Just being modest and conservative. This is without taking into account other factors such as buy back and other revenue they make. 

$2 could be possible if they allocate their 100M properly. I would be too happy if this hit $2-3. Currently have about $5000/17% of my portfolio in it. OPTI to the moon
Why you leaving $1,135.49 in the trash can?
Bought it at the dip, but fomo is one hell of a drug.
Just lie on all the questions but yes you have to be approved
How does inflation play into that?
>So if I'm understanding what I read, selling to close would mean selling my already purchased call for the premium, plus or minus any fluctuation that occurred while I held it, I would take whatever amount that was and close my contract with that person.

Yes, you’re now done with the contract and it’s been sold off to someone else who may exercise.

>Whereas, selling to open would suggest that I already have 100 stocks and am writing a contract to sell to a trader?
You can sell a call or sell or a put. Selling a call means someone has the right to force you to sell to them at the strike price. Selling a put means someone has the right to force you to purchase the shares from them at the strike price. 

>Final question. Can I exercise my contract at any point or do I have to wait x amount of time?

FUCK ALL BEARS. GME HAS THE RETARD STRENGTH
We never ever will. Too retarded.
Sounds like you don't have the proper psychology and mental appetite for trading. Either buy for long term hold or dont buy a stock at all if you are worried about short term moves.
Best answer, thanks fellow retard!

So does the second part of what I say come into play then?   Did selling and missing out on big upside taint your view of the company or people who are still invested?   I mean I have been there.   There is nothing wrong with locking in gains and hindsight is always 20/20 but it is hard to not be irritated when you make a play and then the stock runs up another 500%.    So are you sure that what you believe about the company. and what is occurring now. is rational and not just you being pissed that you missed the ride?
Gonna bleed out like it always does
That WSJ article from 20 minutes ago is awesome hahahaha wow ...GME
Something about a pump & dump
Not necessarily, energy in general could just go up. We're gonna need a ton of energy if Biden announces big infrastructure plans tonight

Might be a bit of a stretch to say the market has never been an indicator of the economy? Back when the main companies were the main employers, there was probably a better correlation. In a world of global and often remote labor, with the differences tech brings, and a market upheld with massive amounts of liquidity from the Fed, the world is a bit different now.

>Because back then a recall would have tanked their company. They put profits in front of people, plain and simple

Tesla did not consider the issues life threatening and a recall probably would have killed the whole company if they did. but Tesla did not start showing a profit till Q2 of 2019 so i dont know what you mean by "they put profits in front of people" when they have been struggling for most of their history to grow and satisfy investors.

but you are giving other companies to much credit. other companies like ford wait years before the issue recalls on thing like electronic rearview mirrors and engine fire risk until to many people complain.

i fail to see how not recalling failing MC1's is as "reckless and dangerous" as some of the recalls other companies have had but companies like GM are experienced when they have to recall 840,000 cars over seatbelt issues.
sure

I'm still trying to figure out that myself. I've made money on VALE and ICLN and APHA leaps and lost money on BABA and CRM leaps. When I spend $2k on a leap it goes down. When I spend $150 to $500 it goes up.
Is this a SPAC? If so, go check out the SPACs sub for info on how to trade these.


I got stuck with STIC because I didn't understand them. You could be holding this stuff for a while or pay way too much.
My god how horrifying
Yeah mb not aware of the proper terms. I think I get it. You're saying they're actually minimizing the squeeze by trading premiums on the calls for price increases to minimize their short position before it explodes. Aren't they still fucked tho on the price difference since they've been shorting since it was like $10 or something? But yeah I see how that's definitely better than a full on squeeze where they'd be out a few bil as opposed to maybe less than one bil now. I guess the move now is to monitor call volumes and see if they're actually doing that? Would one way to counter that is if we retards or the market moves to then buying calls as well?

yes, get in here. If we get the 55$ call in the money 24h after release, there's almost no way it doesn't trigger the squeeze to be squozen.
The problem with T is, that it either declines or goes sideways, it literally doesn't go up like most other stocks do, even if the market is bullish and the dividend is part of the reason for it because it's so high that it obstructs the way to debt reduction.

If OP is right and this hits $100-$300 by 1/22, I make like $4k-$20k depending on when I sell if this calculator is right, correct? Or does this profit calculator change each day depending on movement? 

Seems weird to me that it would shift after you already bought, this is simply a scale of what the price is at what date.

Answering this question is exactly why I use the weekends to create rules for myself for the coming week. 

I always reset my big-picture assessment of my portfolio based on my activity for the week and any price changes, and decide if it's where I want it. 

If a holding has grown too large and needs to be trimmed (Bio Nano), or if my outlook has changed and no longer warrants having as much allocation as I have given it (BABA), or if I've decided that further downward movement means it's time to cut losses, I mark it as one of the holdings that needs to be trimmed. If I find a stock on sale, I only allow myself to fund it through sales I've marked ahead of time, outside of the madness of the trading day. 

This is how I keep my portfolio in line with my risk tolerance. It's also how I avoid panic selling if I happen to notice a stock is down 6 or 7 percent in a day.
Should I go bb tomorrow?

Looking for help picking ETFs to diversify holdings in global online retail.

I researched a few ETFs:

ONLN - top 5 holdings - Amazon, Wayfair, chewy, etsy, ebay. Expense Ratio - 0.58%. Best at dividends as well.

https://etfdb.com/etf/ONLN/#holdings

FDNI - top 5 holdings - Meituan, Tencent, Shopify, Alibaba, Naspers. Expense Ratio - 0.65%

https://etfdb.com/etf/FDNI/#holdings

EBIZ - top 5 holdings - Etsy, Pinduodo, MercadoLibre, expedia, JD.com. Expense Ratio - 0.50%

IBUY - top 5 holdings - Revolve, Qurate, SFIX REAL TRIP - This one seems to do its own thing. Expense Ratio - 0.65%

BUYZ - top 5 holdings - Sea Ltd Singapore, Fiverr, Shopify, MercadoLibre, Amazon, Square. Expense ratio - 0.50%

I was thinking of 50% ONLN and 50% FDNI. Appreciate any counterpoints and advice.

Perfect. I’m loading up.
I have admittedly been wrong about Gamestop up to this point.  (The stock, not the company)  There was a 100% intraday move on Wednesday.  Most places have a 2 day window to cover a margin call, which explains the froth moves to the upside today and into tomorrow.  Heading in to a 3 day weekend, it just seems like a perfect storm set up to the downside.
What's the game plan. They have 6 days to cover, do we hold until Tuesday? I would be fine with 75$?
My stimmy check is going straight into more BB
Oh yeah, I got like 23 shares
I already have $1,800 in calls that's wort $3,450 now but yes I'm increasing my position. Best part? The pltr shares are worth $7,000 right now and it was from snow puts. Basically earning money on money.

They're like a security company now or something. And signed an automotive deal with a China company to build the self driving software for the car? Something like that. I remember people talking about it back in February but haven't heard anything else about BB till today.
Lol Cramer having an aneurism
I imagine landlords without the liquid funds to cover the mortgages on their rental properties could just take advantage of the mortgage forbearance and tack it onto the end of their loan like any other home owner. The property turnover costs you’re talking about is just a risk you take when you are a landlord. There is no guaranteed 100% occupancy on your properties. But I don’t think there will be enough broke landlords suddenly defaulting on their loans to trigger a market crash.

I knew the dems would end up winning the senate because of the unrest in the country as well as Biden winning the state, so there was a real possibility. I went with tilray because weed stocks got huge boosts from just mentioning wanting to decriminalize weed and even Biden winning the presidency, and tilray felt like the best cannabis stock to go with. I also wanted my money back really fucking bad so I said fuck it losing 10k more was worth risking it to get my money back and more

It’s an interesting but tricky situation though. Redistributing wealth typically increases M1 money supply which leads to inflation. 

For the us 99%ers who gives a shit if food costs 2% more, but for the government that’s 30 trillion in debt inflation and interest can lead to a death spiral. Not a great easy solution for easing things back to normal, this obviously isn’t sustainable but the decades of growth at all costs is gonna be tough to unwind

Just saw your post above.  I'm curious if you have any explanation for the current price of \~$39.  What do you think is the justification for it exceeding the high's of 3-4yrs ago?
They delist?
are you selling or holding before or after the conference?

My only regret is not closing all of my other positions for GME today
GME is the next tesla
These are my two:

\-Ocado Group PLC

\-LoopUp Group (this I guarantee will go from 80 to 160 by the fortnight.)
From what I've gathered (not very experienced but I've been holding GME since 18ish) big mutual funds that were shorting have to cover their shares which means all those empty short shares are going to be added into the market. And it's just a vicious circle from there for them, but for us 🚀🚀🚀🚀
@real_zlparker

Thanks if you do end up following!
uh Jim Cramer talking about Gamestop
I had Fitbit call options that expire on 5/21, but now I can't do anything with them because of the Google acquisition.  What happens now?

Fit $8c 5/21 was worth $0.06 when the acquisition went through.  Google bought Fitbit for 2.1B, Fitbit had 244,870,000 shares, so the price that Google bought Fitbit for was $8.58 per share?  Does that do anything for me?
And constantly there are misconceptions that wealth =/= cash, the stock market is doing very well so people with stocks (usually rich) are also doing well if you don’t like it buy stocks
Only stupid if they don't print.
I put 20K more in BB this morning.  Would have been more but fucking Robinhood has a hold on some of my money for who knows why.
Bought the shit out of that SPY dip today, hoping for fireworks tonight!!!
I fucking love this sub
Theoretically that days to cover number is highly innacurate as long as over 100% is shorted

Anyone who has just a few shares don’t be discouraged.  This is where it starts. There will always be opportunities in the future.  Keep moving forward and one day you will be able to buy thousands of shares at a time.  

AND HOLD THE FUCKIN LINE! No selling!

Same, been heavy on weed and solar and it’s been great but missed on GME completely.
Ya. That one felt odd to me. Sold 500 shares for around a 12% profit, sold the remaining 200 shares at 5% profit balcause it felt strange.
I want a GME + BB parlay
Cramer talking about the GME short squeeze lmao
It’s in the second plan. He’s going to talk about it tonight
Wait until GME releases an EV and becomes the next trillion dollar company. Don’t underestimate brick n mortar stores 🥶
Too many words. Needs more 🚀🚀🚀Approval date?
There aren't options available for the ticker you're looking at beyond March 19 or there's a UI bug. You can definitely buy further out than March 19 on Fidelity.
that would be nice

RIP. Covered would be that you have 100 shares for each call you sell. That reduces your risk from infinity to whatever you paid for the shares.
Selling naked calls is risky to say the least.
The Biden stimny thing today doesn’t mean shit til it’s approved by Congress right?
They actual weren't that far out the money. He could have just exercised for delivery of the shares, and to boot, tax harvested.
Ah, so which sub

Even if Biden fails to mention anything about clean energy, shouldn’t the stimmy announcement alone be enough to Hulk dick this market tomorrow?

Been in your shoes, I put $1000 into a robinhood account and I didn’t know what I was doing. I bought an Apple call right before earnings came out and it tanked, lost $250. I then made some better trades got some money off SPCE shares and MGNI shares and calls. Ended up pretty close to $1000 after a month and now all my money is in index ETFS and I’ve made $100 in the last week. Make good plays.
true, but they are going to try and find a way to punish us
>$500 a week

>chump change to some

That's $500 than you had the previous week, dude!
A once in a lifetime pop.

Unless they throw a bluff (they could buy calls and let them expire worthless) we should be buying calls below their highest calls. They might have to keep this up for 7 days though maybe if my math is right

Back in December I read some random comments about BB transforming themselves over the years to be more software oriented rather than hardware by trying to specialize in cybersecurity (huge growth industry this decade). Bought Jan 2023 calls right then and there. Now there's news of them getting partnerships with AWS and EV industry? That shit is dynamite baby.
I did but I wish I did more only 5bills worth

Thanks, I'd like to think so too. I only need it to get to 270.
It’s the ratio of shares sold short intraday

Means there is less shorting happening but they still ARE shorting 

no way of knowing if they closed before eod though

If the price target is $4-5 short term and if its currently significantly lower then you have your answer. It doesn't matter if its 1.7 or 2.05, the target is much higher therefore the only question that should remain is, why haven't you bought it yet?

I guess if your premise is this is some sort of pump and dump play, this makes sense. I don't think you're going to see swings down to the 20's though, today hit the 34 floor and repeatedly bounced. I think fair non manipulated value of the company is 90, and most companies trade at higher than their value so I'm in it for 90-300 long term.

Pretty different. Stripe is mainly a payments processor that allows e-commerce sites to accept payments, versus Plaid currently is just a way to link your bank account to apps like Robinhood, Venmo, etc.

Of course, things could change, and Plaid may try to enter payments processing, but right now it doesn't.

Taken from the article:

> → Plaid is NOT a payment processor

> While their marketing might not make this super clear, Plaid actually doesn’t process or facilitate payments (outside of the UK, at least). They take care of connecting to your bank accounts, as well as basic read-only data (account balances, etc.), but they don’t actually move money around themselves - they typically rely on a third party provider like Stripe or Wells Fargo to do that.

Nah. You made bank off pump and dumps. And now trying to take credit for the GME play that's been being preached on here by a million others as well. Last I seen, you were pumping some shit stonk. Tanked literally the next day after it went up 11 or 12%. Days later I seen you bragging about how rich you were. You stole money from a bunch of wsb retards such as myself. Good for you bro.

Anyways, I don't care if you're a genius at picking meme stocks. You are cringy as fuck. What kind of sociopath makes memes about himself and upvotes anything he does with his 100 accounts. Hurry the fuck up and downvote me more lol. Not all of us care about internet fame
This is the way
I think they are hoping we get scared it will dip and sell during the day, creating the dip. Then they cover slowly until it hits that same barrier. Then they cover more AH and pre-market and hope people take profits early, so they can buy the dip. I don’t know if that makes sense, but what I mean is HOLD

Do you live with your mom? Does she cook your food and do your laundry? You might be 18 but if she is still doing these things for you then whether you have a job or not unless you are paying rent and paying your fair share of bills you are not adulting and therefore not a lot you can do about it. If you’re afraid of her backlash than she still has some sort of upper hand over you in the form of one of things i mentioned in the first few sentences. If you want to be a big boy then you need to do big boy things.

He lost a ton of gains off of them before this runup though.  Peak was like $5 each and it was about $1.50 on Tuesday.

Presumably you bought it to short squeeze, in which case wait until the squeeze is really felt before selling.
Yes sir
I know some expire tomorrow, but is there a later expiration we should be watching? Does Melvin just roll his puts out every month?

I have to read into this a bit more but assuming it's a cash buyout here.  Expiration is accelerated so if you are otm (strike above $7.35) then your options expire worthless.
Omg jimmy chills mentioned wsb. Sub officially ruined.
What can I purchase bb on?
>under heavy scrutiny, its not going to happen again

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're really young.

Tough pill to swallow: their brand is toast. Enron went to shit for more. VW only recovered because a relatively small portion of their brand was tarnished in a section of their market.

A small brand like Luckin is completely fucked. They will never recover, and don't have the market share to even try.

Sell while you can dude.
yes
i think good, he’s talking about short squeeze. and he’s talking about WSB lmao

Great for stocks in the short term I believe but we’ll see the impacts of all of this money printing probably in 2023 or later. Whether that’s positive or negative remains to be seen. I worry that inflation will begin getting out of hand in the years to come.

You’re a few weeks late with the soppy shit, we got this out of our systems on new years eve
As long as there’s also not a bunch of unemployed gaps thrown in and it’s plainly obvious you’re leveling up rather than moving every time management gives you constructive criticism, I imagine it wouldn’t be an issue. Only thing I could maybe see is the new company questioning the cost/benefits of training a new guy with a habit of finding greener pastures every few years. Or maybe they’ll go for it because they won’t need to train you up as much.
I’m in it! B N G O. Ex Tesla management. We’re going to Mars.

As someone below said. They make money on spreads (tiny bits but adds up for them,you shouldn't notice unless you buy stocks with big spreads). But largely also make money with their CFD service I think. Similarly on spreads, but then with leverage so higher amounts.
Lol we're good. As far as ik, all the DD posted here has been publicly available information
Why did BB go up?
Looks like it’s just you and me!
Yeah super easy to get approved
James Jimothy Cramer, this is your mother. I'm proud of you for pumping GME.

Why is BB going up? I don’t want to buy high sell low
the business is not profitable at any stock price, this can't go on.

I am watching the puts of 10,000 🌈🐻on Put 40 slip away from them and they will expire tomorrow and team 🚀WSB🚀 will win.

The average 🌈🐻 put is $3.25 X 10k Vol x100shares.

We are going to lose them $3,250,000 tomorrow by literally doing nothing.😂

45 EOW PUT THEM IN THE GRAVE
Right. My yield falls off, but I'd still have the actual stocks that I could wait out for it to go back up if it ever does. If it doesn't, ill still have made back (assuming the average remains somewhat the same per year) at least 5k every two years until it tanks. If it lasts 12 years without tanking, I'll have made back my initial investment just in dividends.
Deal with amazon
He said it
A Shahenshah... of WSB... could it be possible?
I have been in and out of energy including XLE in since June.  Sure, it's nice to wish you could have gotten it lower in retrospect but you also have to think about the risks at different points.  Say getting in at $28 on 10/28 before knowing exactly when the vaccines would come out and how effective they would be and whether the cases would explode in the winter, it would have been a pretty risky buy.  Getting in at $34ish on 11/10 after Pfizer phase 3 data came out would be a safer bet.  That's when I started buying heavily.  Now winter cases has kind of plateaued, I think XLE will pretty smooth sailing for the rest of the year as more and more vaccines are distributed and life get back to normal.  Basically the risk for XLE going from $43 to $58 will be a lot smaller than from $28 to $43 in my opinion.

My current energy positions are
2000 shares of SLB
500 shares of XOM
10 XOM Jan22 60C
2000 shares of KMI
1000 shares of XLE
500 shares of LPI
DONT TELL THE NEW PEOPLE TO COME HERE, GO AWAY BOOMERS
Interesting thought.  I was aware of the "55" rule but didn't know i could roll an ira into the 401k plan.  I have always rolled from a 401k into an ira.

I will read up on it.  Thanks!
I’ve been holding since Amazon announcement.
FUCK ME!  Literally posted this 15 seconds before Cramer pumped GME.  HAHAHAHAH!  I'll take my gain.  Congrats all.
Lol yeah but what a way to go out
It traded weirdly sideways all day today I feel.

yes, a stop does nothing until the stop price is reached at which time the brokerage enters a market sell order. 

just setting the stop loss doesn't guarantee a sale price though...it only creates a sale at market once the stop price is triggered so if it's on a massive drill you may sell lower than the stop price. you can mitigate this with a stop/limit if you want but i'm generally fine with just a stop if it's something like this where i just want to prevent getting zeroed.
Thank you. Big ups
CRAMER TOLD PEOPLE THEY SHOULD CHECK OUT WALLSTREETBETS BY NAME
It's a good suggestion but I have no open orders of any kind.

I don’t want to be a Debbie downer. But once you go past 100k start changing your strategy to risk diversification and how to not lose your money instead of yolo aggressive.

Okay you all can downvote me now
LMAO Cramer. You better spam your buy button!

by name fucking hell, Cramer we love you
So fucking glad I sold GME, rebought GME at the same price, sold again, bought $1 higher, and held overnight. Worth the wild ride.
BLOW UP THE SHORTS!!!!!
There’s always another day buddy. PLTR leaps is the way to print. 1/21/2022 30c and 50c. Next week should see a little run up in preparation for demo day on the 26th
Biggest thing I’ve ever learned is once you get out stay out

Which also means don’t sell

But when you finally do you have to accept what comes next

No mention of green energy in tonight's announcement by Biden, but it will be in his second package "The second package is expected to be centered on job creation and infrastructure, including hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on clean-energy projects like electric vehicle charging stations, along with health care and education spending, Mr. Biden’s team and leading congressional Democrats have indicated"  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/business/biden-economy.html
DDD price way too low
Have some warrants
Financials have seen a huge power rally with bullish positioning into their quarters before open tomorrow.

All the big names are +50-70% since Nov. This means big institutions are buying in as they’ve been underinvested in banks for years and could take 6-12 months to get their full position.

GS could see 500. JPM 250. BAC 50.

Strong economy + stimulus + higher multiple on a banking subscription model
Bro there’s like 31 thousand shares to buy on the buy side at 41.30 on GME
We have nothing to lose
>If we hit 55, it'll be a disaster because there's more options at 55 then there are between 41 and 49.

Could you reply on why it'd be a disaster please ? The way I see it, it'd drive price up even more, however I am but a simple retard.
We should be more responsible and diversify. Go 50/50 BB and PLTR.
Cramer wants GME to issues shares!! Ahhhh!

Use the money you would have spent on tickets to buy more PLTR... or better yet send the money to me so I can buy more PLTR
JIMMY CHILL SAYING WE SHOULD BUY BUY BUY UP THE SHORTS.
Yeah it’s common sense. Personally I couldn’t be with someone who has an onlyfans and that’s my preference. It’s nothing to do with me being “against empowerment “. Also I guess the people who commented on that post would be cool if their mom had only fans and the guys at school jerk to it. Since “it’s a legal transaction. Cmon man

so what are you trying to do if it's not forecasting? You can just compute the realized vol if that's what you want...
What happened
GME 42.34 AH im ITM now on my objectively retarded YOLO
You guys can thank me for this run. Last covered call I sold was BYND a day before it ran from $60 to $140. I bought 9,500 shares on Cohen's Fri tweet and sold Feb $30 calls for $1.40 yesterday morning. 

I'm not crying as I had 500 April/July $20s and this was my first two comma trade. I sold the balance of my ITM calls today and rolled a portion into Feb $50s to cover things should we spike to Valhalla.
I'm still +300 EOD today with those calls lol can't explain either
Did aftermarket move?

How has this thread gone on for this long without anyone mentioning Snowpiercer?

Not gonna take a short into the speech
i did put $500 yesterday into ACTC and thats gonna be a hold for bidens presidency, what do you think about amazons current price? I feel like it could drop under 3k and then it would be a buy for me
Ah that’s a great idea! The temptation is unreal but I feel it may have already peaked ... Yikes! I’ll figure it out tomorrow

From what I understand, which is very very little because I only browse WSB, is that APHA is being absorbed into TLRY so TLRY is the better buy or something.

Thursday 01/14: WSB was bullish as of market open. Market was -0.35% from last day's close (i.e. flat) and -0.56% intraday. **Wrong!!**

Thursday 01/07: **Wrong**
Jokes aside, when does it come though?
Fuck the shorts baby
I see what you are saying, but to tell people “if you don’t like it buy stocks” is the same as “let them eat cake!” People posting this stuff are the exact people who will use what you say against you. The stock market is not affiliated with widespread economic success, and that is a problem.
I recommend you to check Pinterest
you’re confusing 2 different positions you can take.

one is short selling a stock: borrowing (for a small fee) a stock, and selling the borrowed stock, buying it back later, and returning it to whoever you borrowed from. your P/L is (sell price - buy price) - fees paid to borrow.

the other position is being long puts. you buy a contract giving you the right, but not the obligation, to sell 100 shares at the strike price on/before expiry.

Melvin is in on both, but to unwind their puts, they don’t have to buy or sell the underlying: they just have to sell their puts (or let them expire). To unwind their short selling, they have to buy the stock back, but not at a specific time (margin calls notwithstanding)
That’s an entirely different announcement
Yeah I may go this route
Retarded way to spell BB
How long we squeezing for tho?
# SOUND THE ALARMS. MAKE THE SUB PRIVATE!
Does that even matter? Once it refreshes with the dump that most of the holdings took today it would fall lower?

oh god here comes the boomers followed by the SEC
I actually googled it too lmao And it showed me that ! But I’m glad you cleared it up for me! 
Let’s get these tendies 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I'm glad you got more but this still seems like the short end of the stick. They get to not hire another employee (an increase of at least 100% of your total cost) for only a 12% cost increase, they're saving at least 88%. No title change also makes it much harder to negotiate in the future, and only getting 4% more is insulting. Are you going to start looking for another job? Them being such a pain in the ass for the value you're bringing would sour me big time.
Dude
Fuck me, I’ll be using my new margin tomorrow to buy PLTR calls I guess. WILL NOT SELL MY GME THO 💎🤚🏻💎🤚🏻🚀🚀🚀
Hi newbies! stay away from this place if you want to make money!
You guys thing the big boys who shorted GME are complaining about market manipulation? 😂
the price on calls is absurd on this. looks more like theta gang to me

Damn arkk way to get my hopes up
As a 40 year old, can confirm this take. Didn’t have a cell phone until I was 25. iPhone wasn’t a thing literally everyone owned until 30. But I’d also never buy General Fucking Motors.
Your history is just you insulting and downvoting people that aren’t doing what you are doing? How  insecure do you have to be? Just make your money and let others do what the fuck they want. Pathetic little shit
Thanks. I will probably take out principal after it hits $80.00 or so.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Just set up recurring deposits so that you capitalize on low and high prices, then sit there and watch. If it crashes, you’ll pick up a bunch of shares from your deposits for when it goes back up.
Is buying amazon calls tomorrow a gud play
not a fan of this cramer piece. makes it sound like GME is just a squeeze play. its not
New to this, is it worth putting £1000 on it? I'm in the UK so missed trading hours today:(
Remember when GME was 4.00?
This retard on the fucking farm remembers,and he's kicking himself for not loading up the truck at price.
Do I hate money??
BB GOING TO BE THE NEXT GME MARK MY WORDS🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
21 day old account. Anyone posting TANH stuff is mega sus right now guys.
Proud WSB is Cramer’s must reference point
Blockbuster video is next!
Neat
Buy icln boomer newbies
If these boomers thought we ran the market now, just wait until we get another $1400 check and have our student debt paid off
yea, but not the clean energy sector which is ICLN
WOAH WHY IS BBBY PUMPING NOW. DID CRAMER MENTION IT
I sold all my TSLA to buy more GME and BB but I’ll be back after the squeeze
Honestly, it might raise a bit more imo, but I'd be hesitant if you already have a good payoff. I'm very unsure about if it will increase or decrease at market open, so I'm going the route of not buying.
Set up to the downside like meaning you think the stock is going to fall?
BB the next GME
Bought in APHA and TLRY weeks ago, reaping the rewards as we speak. I’m thinking it’s gonna peak around Jan 20. Might blow out when people begin to realize decriminalizing isn’t going to happen within the first few months.
Dude same! I decided to do it after i bought a few shares today. I picked up 1 $12 for 3/19 but it’s still in queue though so no idea if it will go through 😂
how can i get a vid of this
WHAT STONK SHOULD WE CRUSH NEXT JIMMY CHILL?
Sold half my GME today. Just in case there's a dip, I want cash to buy it up
Same 🔥 cooked up 50 shares before after hours markets closed at 6! 🐐
That was my take the whole time until gme happened. Wanted to cut all my positions that were probably loosing and move them into gme. This probably got me 1 share

At least I made gme teddies but this hurt to watch today
whats the ticker?
imagine buying calls above the cash merger price
Lol for 1/15? Idk if it’ll hit tmr
What are the futures market waiting for??? Let’s moooooon now!
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 6K on the day. 8C and 8.5c bought in the morning for a total of 200. +4400
I'm holding at least until March
CRAMER FOR PRESIDENT
I bought PUTS let’s go.
Did i fuck up buying july $4calls?
Daddy Cramer pump BBBY!!!!!!!!!
I'm just saying do the DD and make the post and I'll consider being autistic with you
GME needs to break $44
I'm not in on GME..
Cramer has a GME position lmao
Oh shit. Hell yeah bruv
I bought AH today at $9.37, already up 10+%!
Between this, GME, and PLTR, it's going to be an interesting year.
Buy the dip
Greek salad, duh, and just like a salad, option Greeks get tossed too
Ya that's my thought process too. I'm worried buy low then 2 weeks later they declare
I'm not telling him shit.  I follow the rules.
ride or die
What do you guys think of NSHS?
You need a power Ponzi scheme. Tell korea to invest some electricity with you. Give all that electricity to japan. Then japan will give you their reserves. Rinse and repeat. Idk who the king of electricity is in Korea but he has to have a public ally listed phone number
BBBY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
GME doesn't need my rally cry lol
Wonder if BlackBerry $BB will be in it
FUCKING LEGEND
Cramer paid respect to the 🚀
Now this is high art
694.20
GME bears r fukk
Bruh... that’s a year away... plenty of time for 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Depending on how much of a gift I would say real estate, but being as how this is a dividend investing forum, I'm gonna say dividends.
Wondering if I should take my profit from my GME 2/19 calls and roll it into more shares or buy a few more calls further out. I’m leaning toward shares
PUMP BB FOR ME JIMMY CHILL!!!
Is GME gonna squeeze hard tomorrow?!?!
Yes
Damn WSB legit might end up getting taken down lol
Happy about the BUYDEN stimmy news. Anyone else think we need to raise the Fed interest rates to combat inflation?
Cramer’s big mouth will singlehandedly bring the SEC down upon us
Anyone else remember 5 months ago when the sub hated Cramer?
u/deepfuckinvalue
Take it private
Are my icln calls still gonna print???
What’s he saying? Hold? Friday? Monday? 2050?
Cramer out here putting us on blast
I totally hopped on GME late, and my spreads still just filled. I love you guys.
STFU CRAMER DON'T TELL GME TO DO A STOCK OFFERING THE FUCK
How do we know if/when they've been margin called?
Advertise GME to all of the newbies to screw Melvin over! Just warn them of how fast shit will hit the fan though, don’t want them bagholding.
How much more are they day trading vs not day trading?
Boomers will not survive in this autistic wasteland, fuck off over to r/investing instead
Options have two types of value.

The first is the value of being able to buy a stock at a certain price. 

The second is the time left on the option.

So while unexpired options can seem like they’re worth zero, if there is still time left on the option is still has some value even if that value is a fraction of a cent.
In case one of you newfags are directed here by Cramer after watching Mad Money, buy PLTR tomorrow and lets ride to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Who let this dumbass breed?
Lmao Cramer is losing his mind
Cramer with the "no look pass"!
GME this week was fun, but the real win for me was actually a 300% play on Tilray calls. I’ve rolled the profits from that into some more later dated Tilray calls and *those* are printing too (and that’s before the opt price reflects this AH fun)

My account is up like 26% this week. It’s been a good week
#FCKMLVN AND KEEP BUYING GME SHARES 🚀🚀🚀
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
plug, nio looks to be dead rn. gonna get out of it if it ever hits green for me lol.  

plug stocks and also a 2/5 70c that hit 10.20 yesterday from 6.10 the day before. i regret not selling yesterday as it dipped lower, but i have faith in it going back up until then
Buying some 1/21 15c  leaps tomorrow, let's gooooooooooooo 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Remember when this sub didn’t stan Cramer 🤡
Tsla Calls
No, today was day one of the big squeezening (+BB hype) and tomorrow we shall continue to feast off of Melvins corpse
Bbby its time my friend
Who could've seen it coming lol
When’s Biden handing out the fuel for our rockets ⛽️🚀🚀🚀🚀

is its still too late to get in?
BOOYAHHHHH
Are my Vale 6/18 25c gonna print? Find out on the next episode of WZBets.
Got a simple lil bet on SPY and ICLN tomorrow. Just give me my modest 5% and I'm out and happy.
This is tomorrow https://youtu.be/kfVsfOSbJY0
No way door dash should be worth this much.
It’s like the battle of helm’s deep trying to get AAPL over $130
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Diversify!
Sure, but this isn’t an argument if you are purchasing a car because you’d learn within the first day
I would imagine that is likely staying the same.
Yes, but you have to tell them you know what you’re doing. Someone on this thread explained the button steps to me since I couldn’t figure it out some time back. In five weeks, I lost $1200 on calls (about 25%).  That being said, calls also made me about 900 today.  I can’t tell you the button presses to do it.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
The only thing it's going to drill is you
It was 128 back in August
Someone here gotta be a lawyer? How do we start a fund co-op?
from my DD I bet ;)

&#x200B;

Also I love you.
Honestly I’d think about back after things get back to “normal”.  Once we get to “normal”, everything is going to be priced in. 

I was looking at my returns this year and damn...I realized this year was the most I’d ever put into the market. 

Not traveling, barely spending just meant I had a ton of cash than usual sitting idly....

Not everybody is me, but probably this is a lot of other people out there too. 

The rate of pumping up stock prices just won’t continue forever when people in the retail sector are circulating money into the economy instead of equities.
Positions?
What’s pelican room
Dude me too. Usually stick to 4 max and I go on RobinHood and I’m scrollinggg through my options and stocks haha
Like TRLY
half my account is ICLN 1/21/22 40c's, helps me sleep at night when I'm diamond handing the other half with FD's
I’m in 🤓 no DD I just saw some rocket ship emojis so I’m in!
I hope it has a nice morning dip tomorrow so I can buy more.
It's close to 43 AH (10% up). I can't see why this thing can't go on another 60% run tmrw haha, the momentum is strong. Fingers crossed 🤞🤞
That sounds eerily similar and I agree my pay stubs leave more questions than answers. I might try to do it myself but hiring a tax pro sounds like a good idea....I've only had bad ones (had to explain what RSUs are) so hesitant to go that route
If today was all buying in anticipation of another squeeze.... boy that fall out will be ugly if nothing happens tomorrow.
I did that too. Learning to be a 💎✋ has been a good lesson.
I would be unstoppable if weed enhanced performance.

Jim Cramer: "ROCKETSHIP EMOJIS"
Is the retard bull market back on? Did biden just say he's putting easy mode back on?
You weren't wrong 🚀
F! The SEC! Let’s take $BB to the moon! 🚀🚀
Is he short WSB? Bro, Cramer banned.
Where should I park 500k for the next 6 months?
dude this mad money is fucking legendary hahahaha
Cramer : “Rocket ship emojis”
How high do u guys think gme will look I keep buying on Margin ??
“Rocketship emojis of course”
JIM SAID rocket emojis 

You know what to do boys

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Nah, I just like this place to stay true to itself. Either 50k losses or 50k w’s

If I wanted to see $1,000 gains I’d check my Dad’s bonds account

Cramer kissed the ring of the autists

When Cramer uses this board for calls
Fukkk I sold my call to early lmfaooo ggwp
Get out of here with your logic
He is still talking about us. Hahaha
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
You thought this subreddit was bad, wait until the normies and boomers flood in after the Cramer shoutout
BUY BUY BUY FUCK THE SHORTS 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Sell minutes later for a loss.
Ah, you're the one they talk about when they say day traders generally lose out
BEDBATHANDBE#MOTHERFUCKIN#YOND
Nice
Stilllllll waiting ... did go up a bit today
16k OI on SRNE LEAPs for 1/20/23, looks like they were bought in November + December so it might be a wait

Cheap LEAPs are my kryptonite man, it genuinely feels like free money
Rocketship emoji’s
Cramer spent a good amount of time pumping Gamestop.  


Time to pay up old man, get on your eyes and service DFV
fuck sounds like MM was lit tonight, someone got a link?
1.8k is a great profit man. If you can handle the stress of downside risk, hold, if you want to take your profits, sell, if you want the best of both worlds, sell your gains and keep the equity in and enjoy the free stocks.
Why not just buy the weeklong puts in case early next Tuesday sees an even further drop?
Stood on the sidelines until now. 5 shares... im all in
bb to the moon
do i sell BB shares on market open tomo? lemme know in the comments
I can’t imagine what’s going through the boomers heads who are browsing the sub right now. My dads going to be asking me about autist and why they call each other “f-ing retards”

Just how it goes
Are we there yet GME gang?
Long term hold or short?
source?
Imagine another big contract.. I’m a safe player, money in 16 stock, different sectors but I put 25% into this. I was in at $14 originally but kept topping up because it’s been the best of all.. also if it’s reached its value is there no value on the further potential 🚀🚀🚀
Kind of sus you want it to be a buff dude.
Slang for press conference
loving me some bb 🚀 🚀 🚀
bought WOOF shares at $27 lets moon
Which do a raffle on stocks, every week we randomly pick a stock between  gme, pltr, tsla, bb, pltr and pltr and we all go all in. Rinse and repeat
Loads of bots on here right now. Just keep flagging em when you see em!
BBBY says Cramer.  Let's jump right in tomorrow
Also why I'm waiting for a good buying opportunity with NVDA.
Let's goooo GME this is it boys
Imagine being a dumb fuck and betting against wallstreetbets by shorting $GME
PLTR short squeeze 🚀🚀🚀
Looool rocketshit emojis ahahahah Cramer is one of us
Holy shit BBBY 🤑 

Another short squeeze 🚀
Uh oh... Cramer about to bring us from 1.8 million autists to 2.5
It worked out, but it was still retarded
Totally goofed the spelling. Organigram is the correct spelling. I’m an autist forgive me
Where did they say majority? Where did they say dominated? Is this a strawman?
I feel like it would be a pretty genius move to sell longer dated GME calls right now. No way this sustains for more than a few days and when it fizzles out, the IV crush is going to kill like 90% of the value of most calls.

Just need some iron balls
Yessir! He just went on a huge WSB rant. It was awesome.
Do what you gotta do... but also do what I want you to do
LOL
Yes or near the money.
What film is this?
yes
Right on , I like to see people win !
In my Venmo account, I’ll double it
Yup better start a backup somewhere.
Mod Cramer please
I'd watch it every day. the advertisers could be robinhood and taco bell.
Deep in VALE options. I have faith 🙏
I don't expect there to be anything big in the short term, it's why I bought LEAPs for 2023 and advocate for people to do the same. I do see ERIC being able to grow market share though as countries re-think their exposure to Chinese tech. You're right, the best time to get in on the 5G, it was late 2019, but the leaders and hazards were less clear then. That being said, I do see more infrastructure spending as 5G extends to small and medium sized cities.
When will Biden annoucne infrastructure plan?
Yeah same. 100k contracts per day for 7 days. Let's hope the premium on those goes up as well to slow them down. Does the premium on a stock only depend heavily on the inherent volatility of the stock itself or could massive demand on the call itself raise its price heavily as well? Also like @shark-oil-robot said, people could notice if hundreds of thousands of calls are exercised at a loss.
https://i.imgur.com/gD8yhwZ.jpg
Yep. Another hype bot!
Getting annoyed that my AMD calls don't print (yet) and feeling sexy about getting early in HelloFresh (+311%) and Home24 (+326% in 12 months). Also loaded up on CD Projekt, hoping the nerds will get over their temper tantrum.
aww shit. this is gonna bring in even more pump and dumpers

Strange times now
KING🚀🚀🚀🚀
Wow BBBBY TO THE MOON
They'd still have a decrease in revenue from this. But yes that would dampen the blow.
Mah man
What did he do now
Watching Cramer now. LMAO. Straight up referencing WSB posts on GME and BBBY. Is this reality?
X for exploration
Why another? Its still the same
Shorts still haven’t covered even with that last run, and that run is gonna force their hand this next week. This is going to $100 at the least, possibly $420.69 if enough people diamond hand it
I wouldn’t sweat it. The LOI was sent out in May for a Q4 2020 close. It’s not uncommon for closings to be pushed back. It takes a long time to get everyone on the same page with the agreements in the LOI. Their attorneys back to read it, revise it, send it back. Your attorneys do the same. It takes a long time. An LOI is a pretty serious thing. It’s nothing set in stone for sure, it’s just an intent. Nevertheless, it’s big.
FIRE has \*always\* been A-Thing™. As long as there has been Retirement.  Just because you weren't aware of it, or not working toward it ... doesn't mean it didn't exist, mmm-kay?

Cramer going full retard hahaha
It’s not a race to first. America also lies extremely low in safety, education, healthcare, social well being, and social stability. 

Countries that rank highly in these are (primarily) Northern European countries that have higher taxes, but those taxes are used on things that directly benefit the people.
Sound kind of like too short, I'm in! Bad ass MC!
Anyone who hasn't seen Mad Money tonight has to watch the first 10 minutes.
The Huawei thing?  Damn that’s a lot of movement for that news alone, feels like speculation on something bigger coming down the pipe 🤔
# RETARDS. 

# MAN YOUR STATIONS.

We are never there. We will keep zooming on the rocket ship.
we should set the sub to private for a bit? especially if we keep getting attention like this
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Cramer just spent 3 minutes talking about GME and how WSB is out to get the shorts. He has mentioned WSB twice.

Now he's talking about a post talking about the sub going after WSB.

This is amazing lol. Opening segment too.
Why? Something bad happening?
off to the gulag with you for blaspheming our lord and savior Jerome Powell. BUY STONKS, SHORT THE DOLLAR
**FUCK OFF CRAMER LEAVE US ALONE *REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***
no. BB or NOK now
kinda wish cramer would go more in depth on GME instead of just talking about the squeeze. it would be dope to get RC on lol
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Still you for buying on margin...... but uhhhh good job though.
How do we know how many outstanding shorts left after today? Or i mean at any time. I still feel like the squzze is not yet happened but in this case how to distribute call $ shares? I'm doing 50/50 now. Thx bro.
Take your own advice dipshit the only reason I'm even responding to you is because you tried to convince people to sell. eat shit degenerate
GME can only go up it is knows
Lol! And then I can see this sub getting regulated
Uh...easy there jimbo. You're drawing just a taaaad bit of attention to us. He literally was just reading posts and calling us sketchy, but the type he likes
Jesus that aftermarket. Why can’t I just have more money to throw at these plays god dammit
The market is ours
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
correct
# I dont know how I feel about all this Cramer exposure.

# Naked.
Hmmm??? Steel seems to be in high demand with a low supply... 
I sure wonder if the steel companies stock price reflects this situation 🧐🧐🧐
STONKS  only go up baby TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Which one of you autists is calling in right now
this bill going to be 10,000+ pages this time?
Serious question, what is everyone's exit target price for GME? It was 100 for me but given some analysis of the shorts and how little they have covered so far, i've updated it to 125+ .  This could honestly keep going even further than that and I plan to update my thesis daily. Although I still might lock in some profits once it breaks 100.

What is everyone else thinking?
Remind me 74 days arkx
God, I got killed on Apple today.  I should have sold and went into CRSPR.

I think they’re going to increase the day trading cap at most. They can’t really change the options purchasing as it’ll affect the brokerages negatively too much. Banks are cashing in pretty hard with the amount of people entering as well, as they are profiting off the margin calls on retail traders which are at an all time high
Where can I purchase bb from
Go with your gut at the end of the day. Take out your initial investment and leave the “house money.”  Also, I wouldn’t anticipate a crash per se, but more likely would be a correction with those valuations. Don’t try and time the market. If it helps you sleep, sell some. Act like when you’re trying to leave a conversation but that person keeps talking to you, one foot out the door and both feet pointed towards the door.
this is the last bastion of all that is great on reddit.
Damn son! That was surprisingly good
**MOOOOOF** 🐄
Declining performance pre-COVID, shares diluted by like 40% during Covid due to new issuances, and a year of losing $8-9B...sure this is clearly a great investment right now, if you define those purely in that share price is currently low and use to be higher.
Good times
y
I wonder if cramer ever seen any  of my 🚀🚀🚀 comments.
Up 45% 🚀🚀🚀
Cramer is literally telling people to check out WSB & read about how they’ve been planning to squeeze shorts on GME & BBBY. 

What world is this??? lol
114% gain over \~100 days, now down 5.7% from last week's ATH on Friday morning, still twice as high as where it was trading less than four months ago. 

There's no problem with ICLN.

PLTR will be over $50 by February 1st
Bought 900 more at the open this morning, raised cost basis to $25.09.  3100 shares total.
I love you, Cramer.
We’re not worthy
Thanks for the actual response i appreciate it

I mean I dunno but the number is higher
It's the goofiest shit.  I'm not even salty about options or anything, I've just been sitting here for five years waiting on it to self correct and being baffled at how it just *won't*.

Fuck you
Shift filed form 25-NSE with SEC today. 
https://newsfilter.io/a/e902ba3143a0cf8d4a8eb491bb74f118

Anyone can explain what does this mean?
My understanding is it'll reduce liquidity, meaning better for the stock price!?
Did you pay attention to what she said was going to crash though?  

Have you seen how well the ARK funds did after the last crash? I have 120 shares of ARKG, 50 ARKQ, 100 ARKF and a few other genomic investments. But my long term stocks are all ARK and TSLA. Considering how ARK actively manages their funds and will buy on the dip, I hope there’s another stock market crash.
Hey btw I bought calls post market I didn’t realize what time it was for 10c. Am I fucked now? They ain’t gonna go through? Bought for like .67 cents
Wow
Bbby 40 EOW!!!! Thanks uncle Jim!!!
TSLA go go up!
You reading this Blackrock? You reading this JP Morgan? You reading this Jefferies? This is just the beginning.
Stacking every dime they give me.
80% shares, 20% options.

> Oil companies are loaded to the teeth with debt

Beg to differ; oil stocks have *extremely low* levels of debt compared to many other types of company (particularly: CVX, TOT, XOM). Further: most of this debt has been taken on lately at stunningly low rates of interest - almost certainly the right move assuming return on capital invested over 3% ish.

If it's true I guess it's gonna be like 1 or 2 buck annual increase till the $15 mark is reached.
This reminds me of that commercial with the guy holding a fishing rod with a dollar on it and he keeps going "Oh, too slow"
Someone post the clip of Cramer talking about WSB
You know what you spoiled brat? Why don't u invest in an ice cream parlour. It's the only thing you'll EVER be good at. Have a good day loser.

Sike lol fuck the suits
I give Cramer the pro mod feature. He made my day today. Get ready for GME and BBBY tomorrow!
I’d have taken it at 100% return so you’re smarter than I am
All tech was at AH in aug due to SoftBank pump but the key is Apple has already gone up 7% from that AH...

Im high as fuck and this shit ain't bad!!
A fine clip!
CRAMER FULL WSB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Cramer we are the captains now.
Also, you should always have an exit strategy before entering a trade. This keeps you from making snap judgements from panic. Anyone who has been trading for any amount of time has these kind of stories. I have gotten where I don't even bring them up, I keep them to myself as personal battle scars. If you dwell on them it can cause you to do something even more crazy like a rage all in just before an underlying gets absolutely demolished. Only share the winners.
Fuck that! Only if they were covered. Imagine this actually squeezes after you sell naked calls, rip
worst plays i've ever made were fumbled re-entries.
HOLD
venmo me i will give you a 20% off coupon
tsla is so 2020, it's BB and GME's time to shine boy
Hold.  This is the way
Dude Cramer mentioned your DD today lol
Same with Tbell
depends where in the world you live
There are calculators exactly for this. Just google one there are tons, there are also apps etc
Not sure if [this](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/1/14/6174001-16106192874408154_origin.png?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) is what you're looking for, but it may help.

Do you think Ford is making a comeback?
When do I sell?
When do I buy?

Brrrrr amiright??? 😅
What the fuck did baldy say this time
Cramer just referenced a wbs post pumping a BBBY short squeeze written this morning lmao
Ive never been so disgusted to make 500% on a trade
Could've more than triple that if i held bb for the day
I shorted NIO this week and made $2,578. And that's not saying NIO won't continue to run, but not this week.

You can listen for free online, audio only

Someone clip Cramer talking about GME and post it
They don’t close out the positions all at once...

Anyone know where I can find updated GME short interest numbers?
We need a paper trading comptetition
check back with me tomorrow and let’s see who’s gonna eat a fatter dick😈
February
I can’t recall another Friday I’ve been looking forward to more
Saw no 🚀🚀🚀. I’m out
Lol no
Watch boomer papers talking about the man, the myth, the legend soon.
So what I am getting out of this is APHA 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Rest of my money is riding with Papa Cohen right now, really wish I took a higher strike but those contracts are still going to be juicy, I’m going to look for next dip to get in bigger
6:15 est.
GME ain't done
what call price?
All in on ipof , psth, bft
69 baby
apple boomer stonk
This is probably the most likely explanation, very easy to digest too
In college, we had a behavioral economics teacher that was incredible. He managed a massive fund for a long time and was basically a baller. Apparently when the university asked him how much he was expecting in salary he said, “Oh I don’t need the salary. What’s the minimum you can do?” Turns out the minimum was $50k, so he accepted that and probably donated it. He just loved teaching behavioral economics and I can’t blame him....seems like the ideal retirement job.
Yes please
Mods if Cramer ever posts on here he needs to be a mod
ARM chips making big splash (see the new Apple M1 chips). AMD presumably making some ARM chips and not Intel based ones. So theres that too
Cramer just pissed all over your dip.
well realistically people said 50s... we're already closing in. The real price was like 120+
I just want to say thank you to all you glorious bastards,  made 2k in 2 days on GME. This is my first big win and I'm still holding! 🚀🚀🚀
We're about to get brigaded by even more retards. We grow stronger.
Wow. Thats...retarded.

TO THE MOON🚀🚀🚀🚀
My 20% down GME 44c calls that I held for gap up looking good.
Hey boomers, kindly die off thanks in advance
I was waiting for Cramer to mention u/DeepFuckingValue
Hey is there any doubt after this that you need to hold and not sell?
That's interesting, but I'm not really sure it tells us how / why more strikes get added?  Did I miss something obvious?
Not my move, but i love how every i sell to take some profit, my button press to sell literally triggers the rocket shit and i miss the juicy nectar infused gainz.  i'm not bummed, actually im kind of bummed
Do tell
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

GME
I still hate Cramer.
So you are saying those could be orders from naked call sellers covering their calls?
Eh honestly I have the same feelings about Tesla and I never bought it because I always felt too late. God damn was I wrong.
Not for weeks
The only downside I see (with most chinese stocks, not Nio specifically) is reporting transparency. Be prepared for lots of embellishment, and some out right fabrications. Still, the fundamentals of China going all electric in the coming decades far outweighs the downside risk.
CITY
Is somebody here smart enough to make a dedicated WSB website for when this place gets shut down
Did Cramer speak on BBBY?
$50? get real.

it's going to $100
he mentioned wsb apparently but thats not why i hate the man. he just looks like my redneck uncles who chug pbr and smell like cigarette butts. his whole aura pisses me off
Does anyone know anything about reverse Morris trust transactions? Essentially, looking to find an easy way to see if the deal is oversubscribed or undersubscribed. I’m quite sure I’m dumb and missing something obvious.
thinkorswim
It'll hit 50 tomorow
While I do like plug, I find the IV abit too expensive? But I'll get in if there's a dip. Nio is a long term play
and here i thought you retards were a bunch of clowns gambling on a brick and mortar game store that appears to be dying. To GME squad, I congratulate and salute you
Everyone talking about “the next GME” kiddos listen up - GME ain’t over with yet! We ain’t even at the half way mark 💥🚀

🖕Melvin
🐐
Idk but GME goes up -> margin available goes up and I keep buying more... only at $26 avg now but up almost $2.5k... I’ve more than doubled my account in a week after seeing small but good gains for months.
Cramer was just talking about us on mad money and gamestop
Bet, wishing you make 1000. So I get two pizzas
Lol this aged well. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Cramer is obsessed with WSB
Is there a private sub already? I feel like we should start a movement to that, this attention is a lil sketch
Sub needs to be taken off the front page again
*How are people still asking about when Biden’s thing is? Everyone has been spamming it for days*

Bit late for that
Hell no!! 💎💎👋🏻👋🏻
Eh, it’s usually a brain fart when I forget. It’s on my calendar, I generally have a plan for what do (sit on my ass and do nothing counts!) but then a coworker will sign off with “enjoy your three day weekend!” and it’s like, shit, thanks for the reminder again! Where’d the last few hours go?
$60? This is gonnna squeeze way higher than that!
I got 27.5 for that date but I bought it at the peak lmaooo
GME, 5-bagger, 10-bagger, 20-bagger? Choose your bag

If you look at VW 2008 this can go up'n down in an instant. I will set it at 100 and would be fine with it.

What would stop banks from cutting Plaid out and implementing that functionality themselves in future? Just trying to understand the moat here
What did he say
BB?
Balls deep in June calls, checking in.
Name dropped WSB
Manipulate the market.
Yeah from -.4% to -.08%
GME short squeeze is starting to flow over into other stocks....BBBY is doing the same thing....It's been on a tear from $18 to $27 today, and another 4.75% in the AH so far.
https://www.cnbc.com/live-audio/
841, I bought like a monkey with no brain. But that’s my fault I just thought they’d go up a little more than they have
What’re we realistically looking for GME to hit tomorrow? 50? 60? 70?
Cramer actually mentioned us by name.
I think he’ll figure out why we call ppl “f-ing retards” in about 5 minutes of browsing.
This meme fucking creased me up
vtv, vbr
🦓 🚀 🌙
Very possible because I think he said he called them to ask them if they were going to do financing or something?
Also curious. I think we wait for the press conference and go to the moon.
Yes pleas
I bought my first option today. 50x $BB 15c 2/5. I made more on that one trade than all of last year.
PLTR to 50 by end of February. 120 by EOY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Never did you fucktard. Just said what I did. Go drink your mothers enema
No.
Hey money is money. I talk stocks to guys with 100k accounts and 400 dollar accounts. I’m somewhere in the middle.
Told my co worker about GME and now he thinks I'm a stock expert.

In reality I have no idea what I'm doing.
Why does it laugh
Tesla you’re such a piece of shit

You have eyes, yet you do not see. Stock price is based on sentiment. There are 1.8 million degenerate stock traders in here. When they decide they like a stock, you need to listen.
You're going to be living in the lap of luxury. 🚀
And fucking gamestop
Amzn?
Exactly if tax rates go up we are more prosperous. Just think of it as we all put our money in a hat then divide it evenly.
G fucking G man, i have to ask because im worried for you but, are you worried about iv on those apr calls?
DD confirmed.
I don’t get how it affects the price if there is no shares really dealt. How is there a trade? ELI5?
There was a linked article and DD on /stocks a few days ago. Seemed legit.
Fuck no. Let us have this glorious run then we’ll crash mate. The world will be fine
    [SEC has entered the chat]
I own an Intel CPU.

I own AMD shares.
Still too late for calls?
The bid/ask might be wider, just less buyers. You should be able to sell it as long as it’s a highly traded stock
weis wave volume
Always has been. 

It's so hard to monitor and find and so widespread it's like looking for a needle in a stack of needles.

Even the rules to help are pointless. CEO has to declare stock sale 6 month in advance of them doing it? Cool cool, just save up all the good news for the week before your pre-annoinced date and drop the bad news afterwards.
Serious question: is there an advantage either way? You either get 100 shares at $8 or 100\*($8 plus $premium) which would be enough to buy 100 shares at that current price.
cant find it on robinhood
The problem comes in not with a legal transgression of the First Amendment, that you are correct only deals with government infringing on the freedom of speech, but that the First Amendment was written in a very different era when the threats to free speech were very different. So, in the 18th century the danger was that if you went into the town square and voiced opinions that powerful people didn't like you might get locked up. The problem now is that today's equivalent of the town square is owned by your Mark Zuckerbergs and Jack Dorseys; you are not in danger of being locked up, just corporate America has been handed the keys to lock you out. So, while there is not a legal violation, there is a disconnect between the law and its intent and the values that underly it. That could pretty readily be legislated away, though depending on how that happened it might actually be a blessing in disguise for social media companies since they would no longer be stuck in a bind between the pressure to censor and the widespread perception that their ability to censor is illegitimate.

In terms of whether any censorship is really justified, I don't see why we would wish social media companies to have any greater latitude in restricting free speech than the government has--which basically boils down to a handful of categories, such as speech that is very directly dangerous (e.g. shouting fire in a pre-pandemic movie theater; calling for someone's murder), or areas such as child pornography. There is also extreme bias in what gets labelled as "dangerous" and how actions are characterized. If they same standard were applied to any organizing of demonstrations, rather than just ones that most of us agree we dislike--particularly ones that result in violence--there would be very few activists of any kind allowed on social media. If the exact thing happened in Caracas or Hong Kong (i.e. capitols of countries where the U.S. government doesn't like the government) as happened here the rioters would have been labelled as "Pro-Democracy Activists" and their deft use of social media would have been applauded (as has already happened in many places around the globe). Every news article or opinion piece that promotes a new war (NYTs being one of the biggest offenders, not having stopped from the straight propaganda that led us into Iraq) would be censored for promoting violence, if not war crimes. Most of us are very happy with the presence of BLM on social media, but think back a couple of decades and you can be very sure that the politics of the day would likely have gotten MLK banned from Twitter, and certainly Malcom X. So, without a transparent standard of course people are going to be uncomfortable with social media corporations being the gatekeeper for free speech.
Enough deep dives, the posts you see with real numbers and information regarding the future of the company, the non-meme posts, we got about 100 on GME and eventually people who don’t even read them realized how legit it was
Something because the SEC is not gonna say okay here’s your warning. No, they ain’t gonna put up with that shit

Why is BBBY up so much. I literally bought a call because of you guys and I’m up 120%
I’ve had them on my watchlist, but figured I had plenty of time to get in since it just launched a month or so ago. 

Now I’m waiting for a dip. :(
I had BB 1/15 8.5C @ 0.08 a contract and sold at 1.00.


I'm super happy with my gains but, I'll looking to get back in for the long term tomorrow morning, anyone else feel the same and what strike are you buying?
now *that's* podcasting, sec!
Is Cramer a real person? His personality is literally something I’ve never seen before. But he doesn’t necessarily seem crazy
It’s historically quite volatile and you will be green long term. $150 isn’t bad especially with promising Q4 results coming out.
this needs to be a copy pasta
Hopping in the dip 🚀
Boomers gonna FOMO into GME hard tomorrow. 50 by noon

How do you know if someone doesn't own a TV?

A better question is ... “why the hell isn’t it in my profile?”

I was down a $1000 a little over a month ago and now im up 25% $1,500, I'd say panicking, paper hands, and shitty calls before I knew how to buy options was why.  it feels good to make a comeback
How high do you think MSOS will go?
Even better. Clean energy talks going well hype

Yes sir!
Hottests funds right now are "green energy funds". My fund literally moves like a stock, meaning it makes around 10% a week. Total money machine. Green energy like Tesla in general is a hot investement rn. Im not giving advice this is just my opinion

They have to play this on demo day!! At minimum the pregame music.
I’d love for you to share Blast Off 2021 with me, I’d be super thankful :)
Oh
This David guy plays the most boring version of a straight man I can remember.
moon
Cramer thanks for the GME name drop tonight on Mad Money
by bag is full. you smell that? daddies home
Quick question, I am holding some TSLA 1200c 2/19, do we have any hope the stock will one day pass the 900 mark, feels like it’s been stuck in the 840-860 range for days. Or should I sell at a loss and invest elsewhere.
Yup he mentioned both GME and BBBY just a while ago!
The boomers are coming. Wsb is getting too much attention
im gonna buy more weeklies and monthlies and shares after i collect the tendies
Gme to Pluto!
The shorts aint even started covering yet.
fr tho
Something to cheer up my fellow ICLN holders "The second package is expected to be centered on job creation and infrastructure, including hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on clean-energy projects like electric vehicle charging stations, along with health care and education spending, Mr. Biden’s team and leading congressional Democrats have indicated" https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/business/biden-economy.html this is one good too https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/
SOMEONE SIGN THIS MAN
I am from Belgium, so Europe knowledge. Not knowing all taxes arround Europe but I can work with what you give me till now. 

First off congrats on the 5 to 12k ride. Good job. And I see you have a diversified portfolio so on your investments I have the impression you know what your doing.

Without bragging, but that you know where I come from with my advice. I’ve been a financial advisor for some years, now work at an AM on a dealing desk for OTC derivatives.

I will now focus on your wish the be financially independent. Which was my first goal after I had a job.

Now at this point what you have is an upcoming job with 3k a month and +-12,5K in stocks and ETF, right?

You will buy an apartment in Italy. Cuz 100k got a house sounds not possible. I am gonna estimate your housing at 150k to have some margin. Taking a mortgage of 15years will come at approx. 900 a month. Which leaves you with 2100 for monthly expenses. You should be able to save every month between 500 and 1000EUR. I don’t know your lifestyle and if there is a partner. I take some general assumptions here.

Most important tip I would give you is to build a cash position ASAP when you got the job. Try and get a cashbuffer of 3 to 5K that JUST SITS there and is available at all time. This is some kind of emergency fund. If you have this and pretend you don’t, it is a cushion to safe you for when you have bad luck. Your car is suddenly ruined, suddenly you washer and dryer die on you, a surprise tax bill,...

Once you are there make sure you utilize any fiscal saving options. In Belgium we can do pension plans which give us the opportunity to save 1k a year in a plan and get 30% back via our taxes. Catch is that you have to keep the money blocked till age of 60. But a garantueed 30% investment is a no brainer. Check with your bank if you got options like this. 

And then I would start pouring in your stock portfolio. 

I do want to remind you that you invested during a period of time in the stockmarket where it was hard to fail. You might wanna take some profit now, keep some extra cash aside until you are settled a bit. You don’t want to have 15k in the market, for some reason it corrects, you have some extra costs with the new appartement and you become obligated to sell with a loss... try to be prepared instead of getting in that situation.

That’s it for now 😂
"hey! i'm cramer"

what i've been hearing him say up until a year ago (for real): "hail! cramer!"
135c exp 1/29, uncle cook need to make a move,
What BB calls shojld I scoop tomororw?
I didn't sell yet.  
If I said once, I said it a million times: only way I'll be gay is by touching wifes' boyfriends dick, not by not holding GME
The sponsor would obviously be Wendy’s.
Chill, I just started my big boy job and took 2k from my 401k put into a brokerage and sent it all because of WSB big brains on my very first investment.

Twenty-two years old making 65k in Florida, don’t worry, my time will come ;) I’m entirely new to this.
what stock was this
For all you boomers coming to the sub right now just going to let you know you should sell everything in your 401k because that shit is going at a turtle speed and buy ICLN instead
He blew up wsb rn
Hell yeah!!
Literally just listened to it live
How high do you think MSOS will go??
It's nice knowing that someone other than us is getting fucked and we are winning.
This should be stuck, good job. That takes some talent.
Quick! We need mod sticky that says you need to own GME shares in order to join the sub
Bring back pltr
Cramer shops at BBBY
I dont know what to say anymore.. somebody GIVE HIM THE KEY TO THIS SUB!! 🚀🚀

If it hits 120 by EOY I’ll get a WSB tattoo and take a picture of it in my new (and first) house with the money I made
Damn! Blackberry dominating the EV market is the greatest thing since GameStop started delivering COVID vaccines!  
ALL IN, YOLO.
Bbby 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
You can either exercise your call and buy those shares or (as most people on here do) sell the contract for a profit
Use stimmy to Pay off credit < gamble on bb
Thanks
My guess (and this is just a guess) is that they won't undo anything that makes them look like they are Chinese puppets. If they undo it, it's going to be low on the priority list.
i’ve heard mumbling of something like that. either way, more regular members are on the discord so that’s one way to filter out people.
Hey all you new to WSB sent to us by Daddy Cramer. If you want in on tomorrow’s short squeeze get your BB while you can.
It’s crazy! I’m sure they’re loving it.
Yep, Gamepass --> Gamepass xCloud --> Remote access to supercomputers and every single thing you could ever want to do.

Shoutout to ShadowPC
Is there any spot to watch CNBC free on mobile?
I literally have more in GME than in my bank account right now. Buy more or wait it out?
What BB calls? I Wana grab like 3 months out
Collective buying to manipulate a stock price is illegal. You retards are going to get this sub shutdown for this kind of shit
Lucid motors definitely the next meme on here
When is it pltr’s turn :(
BB and NNDM are my plays on open
Can we help move PLTR please it’s time to dine
Omg Cramer is such a retard
What’s the stock play tomorrow. Let’s keep this going
What’s the strike price for the squeezed contract?
2/12 I just want to hold through Biden’s inauguration I believe it’ll pump once he’s in office
Favorite is Nio -  I bought in at under $40 and held. I really loved the look of that SUV when I saw it. It looked better than most EV's for my taste and now the sedan is even cleaner. I hope they made a coupe 2 door soon.

Most profitable is Apha - bought in super cheap and i'm at 93% profit

Runner up: DDD I bought in around $11 which I thought was high and then sold at $24 ... all of it. It's now $31 but i'm not crying over it
I think there is much more to it, but I would be cautious and maintain a stop loss
[https://www.livenewsnow.com/american/cnbc-america.html](https://www.livenewsnow.com/american/cnbc-america.html)
There are only two questions:

1. When to take the profits?
2. What colour Tesla do you want?
Don’t even know the company name And I threw a $100 at it. Fuck it got money to fuck around with.
SO MUCH MORE MONEY FLOWING INTO BB!!!!!!
Okay final final question here so sorry you've been incredibly helpful.

If I sell to close, am I hoping that someone else picks up the contract, or do I just get to drop the contract right then and there and move on my way?
mother

of 

all

short

squeezes
Great! Especially Facebook
Does anyone know if SEC could actually do something to us? I mean we do DD with rocket emojis... so it's legit.
Have you seen him in person? Could be a hologram or something
Yes
Sold my pltr today to double down on BB.
So when does the short interest data come out for GME? Supposed to be on the 15th. If its low it could start the sell off. If it's high, I'm buying everything
All depends on what your hands are made of
Question on LEAPS pricing

Why is the break even on deep ITM LEAPS less than it is on OTM Leaps with the same expiration?

For instance: GME 230120C

$2 strike $37.90 cost = $39.90 break even

$10 strike $30.60 cost = $40.60 break even

$20 strike $25.75 cost = $45.75 break even

$40 strike $20.23 cost = $60.23 break even

$55 strike $15.63 cost = $70.63 break even

Aside from just buying the underlying, what am I missing?
let's do it
Should I buy “follow the smart money” and lose thousands?
Ah snap, I missed out on Tesla too! Need to go with my instinct!
Wondering if ARKX will pick up LMT due to its track record
We just have to migrate somewhere else if it does
Not yet if you don't sell
literally everyone yelling hold all fuckin day and you listen to the Melvin intern shilling for his job
Ok but OMEG is still a SPAC, which is what I advised learning more about.
Is Tesla hitting 900 tomorrow with the clean energy money🤔
I sold out of all my positions bar ARKG and ICLN over the last two days and went all in on GME and BB this morning lets get rich 

237 shares GME 34$
400 shares BB 8.4$ 
14 1/15/23 $15 calls
Let's go boys!
It’s been good for writing options tho
Tilray is on an upswing now. Kinda fun
bought 951 shares today 10.5 price
Agreed. They are gonna wreck this country before the die off. Oh wait, already happened.
Thanks boomers!!
**This sub needs an age check** Anyone over 40 needs to be banned ASAP.
What happened C C I V? I ain’t on no moon after 2 days- Fellow Retard
I fucking had a work call and didn’t put in my 10c 1/22 for .68 til after hours. Am I now fucked and that won’t go through?
Once GME is done squeezing, the PLTR time shall come
PLEASE POST VID OF CRAMER
Up until now I’ve lost so much money trading. I used to get traumatic flashbacks whenever I heard people talking about stocks and gains around me.

Currently I’m 66% up on GME. Now I can’t stock refreshing my WSB, and my stock twit feed 😊😊
I don't want to get blamed when he loses money
I got out. I don’t know, feels like they would’ve said something by now to capitalize on the hype.
In for 100 more shares in addition to the 50 I had.
i really think he will. as retarded as we are here we make some fucking money. the people in charge dont like that. ive been seeing more and more articles mentioning wsb and i just got a feeling in the next year or two with this type of exposure us and retail investors in general are gonna hit with all types of new regulations
Whats the next meme stock after BB and GME?
Also first time taking part in an Autist Play. Bought 44 shares on market open and lost like 200 bucks in 5 minutes but I held those fuckers with my infinity gauntlet and now I am sitting inside the 🚀
ARK’s are literally the only thing making me money rn. Apples been flat and PLTR, well, I’m sure you can guess...
Yea, it helps with luck and extreme volatility. Most other times they would expire worthless but this was a great fucking bet given the timing
It’s because every highly shorted stock rn is getting squeeze cause there afraid the same will happen to them like Black berry
if you don't need the money dont sell plug...its only just started.
Melvins tendies gonna look so good in my account
Lol I bought one contract but it’s my first options trade I just wanna see what happens. I am a newby so with options do you sell the call?
Why did you quit?
I made no mention of hoping off. I’ve have two tickets to outer space.
Don’t you have a sister to fuck? What do you want from me😂

Aren't there still concerns that US exchanges are going to de-list Chinese companies or was this resolved?  I also know public perception is that Biden will be "weaker" on China but in hindsight China abused Trump for four years.
Booyah!!!
Your response hahahah
For the love of god choose PLTR
Add those together and theres your answer
brokerages share the same options chain, the stock you're looking at just doesn't have further expiration dates yet
Not on robin
What app is this?
I had already bought the 2/19 8c at open after seeing some posts last night and being on the fence about it. Saw the money printer warm up and sold some other positions to get a Sep. 9c and a 2023 10c. Let's fucking GOOOOOO!
Same here, I'm glad that i trusted the autists on this site
Right here bby 💋 https://rocketreach.co/alexander-karp-email_20691813
Why would this be dumb lol
I hold almost all shares but at least I have the dignity to be deeply ashamed of my cowardice!
Hey thanks
dude just invest it in VTSAX and leave your money alone. there's no shame in it at all
had my finger on the buy trigger for BBBY today but switched to ICLN. Better not have been a big fuckup
How the fuck is investing in stocks you believe in manipulating the market, GME had about 5 different indications that it was massively undervalued based on profits, leadership, console drop, shift to e-commerce, shorts, so obviously people wanted in
he said he called to tell them to issue shares lol
I was once a doubter, but now I'm committed
I’d recommend an options broker my friend.   Trading options on SPACs would work on a SPAC with this type of setup.

If not, I’d stick to SPACs closer to NAV.
If you’re selling calls, you should be nervous. This is euphoria on steroids. Buy calls, hold shares, ride to Valhalla
I make 1k a month working as a student I own ~5k BB shares.
There was smart doods finding out how many shares in total were failed to deliver, if one of you reads this, would love if you put some time in to this
I would have more X in each day lol 📈🚀

BB up 16% after hours 🚀
i'd like to paint houses for a living
 A blue-chip stock is a stock that comes from a well-known, established company.
So, sort of new to this, would we sell GME tomorrow or home through the weekend
Because if OP is right all the data points to a drop tomorrow, not Tuesday, and weeklong puts will have theta priced in (and 500%-700% IV) whereas OTM 0-day FD's will be significantly cheaper.  


For example if GME hits around $45-48 tomorrow then a $40 FD put will be selling for pennies (probably 30 to 40 cents), and if he's right that's an easy 20-bagger. On the other hand if I buy a $40 put for the following week it would probably cost $4-$5 and have it's unlikely GME would drop down any lower than $20 (and I doubt it would go that low), which would be at best a 4x to 5x gain.
Just posted the same thing then I saw this. It’s nice to see the big boys take notice. I just hope the strategy doesn’t get fucked because of it
Take it all and invest in BB for real
This is the way
Sometimes, you gotta be a little crazy to keep yourself from going crazy...same rule applies to retarded
Didn't read, count of rockets in post = 5, so buying more GME.
Holy shit we fucked Melvin 2 times this last week. They are short BBBY AND GME
Should i grab calls tom morning?
Thanks!
Pretty soon there will be more SPAC EV makers than there are customers at this rate.
As i mentioned in my DD, I think this one is a slow grinder. They broke some news yesterday that they're offering I believe $900m in sustaniblitiy linked senior notes, which is why they've had an epic gain so far this week. 

&#x200B;

I've closed most of my Jan/Feb calls, but holding everything else. Jan 2022 and 2023 leaps are crazy cheap still. 

&#x200B;

Man, bought and sold over past couple weeks for other play only to get burned not having any.. jumped back in, bought 2 1/15 34c, ended up selling one & buying 20 shares @ 39 at close because why not. watching after hours.. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
what the hell does sell mean?
Explain or link that?
im calling into mad money and telling him to keep wsbs name out his mouth
BBBY
Is it too late to get in? What calls should I buy?
#ONE OF US
I’m an idiot and staying away from volatile stocks for a bit. Trades GameStop for a loss today when I bought higher in the morning and ti started to drop. Feared we’d reached the top and too on $150 loss with a sell. 

FML. Congrats again to GME bagholders.
Oh my yes. Couple of times we would take coho salmon straight off the boat and throw it on the bar's grill. Probably a health code violation, but meh.
The reason BABA stock dropped had nothing to do with Trump, but rather that Jack Ma disappeared and the CCP is probably going to break up the company. With the exception of things like Aliexpress, almost all of Alibaba's business is domestic. While I hope it is not the case, I am very bearish on BABA for the time being.
What did he do

Cramer indirectly put a hit on WSB with that. He is mad and/or jelly of our gains

This bitch opens at $60 tomorrow and I'll be super happy, $100 happier, $200 mooning.  Fuck these shorts.   Love you all.  At the end of the day no matter the open I get paid $58.65 a share if it closes over $50 and get exercised.

My portfolio has been 100% GME for the last 2 days for optimized tendies. Will do the same with BB depending on how tomorrow looks.
Please pump ASTI to the moon. Thx
Hope he didn't sell lmao
Lol same
truth. BOOMERBEGONE
Same bud, same.
i like them. helps break up the text and add some sass, hehe.
Tell me i’m not retarded if i buy this shit at open tomorrow
So we made a lot of money from GME going up, will there ever be when we make a lot of money make a stock going down. That's be hilarious. Where's Luckin Coffee 2.o.
I got Mar 19, 21s on Vale
Hehe, that I did my friend. Not into GME though, but it's pretty spectacular these days.
Guys Bb is the move
Fuck it buying 100 shares
Just means wannabee cool kids will also buy this shit. Feeding our gains. That said - anyone long is a hero.
Yea. Fuck the shorts.

Fuck, wish I did.
Question on LEAPS pricing

Why is the break even on deep ITM LEAPS less than it is on OTM Leaps with the same expiration?

For instance: GME 230120C

$2 strike $37.90 cost = $39.90 break even

$10 strike $30.60 cost = $40.60 break even

$20 strike $25.75 cost = $45.75 break even

$40 strike $20.23 cost = $60.23 break even

$55 strike $15.63 cost = $70.63 break even

Aside from just buying the underlying, what am I missing?
In on BB at $10.20🤠
I think the primary purpose of WSB from this point forward should be to punish all short sellers and initiate short squeezes. Fuck DD, fuck earnings, fuck all that. Short squeezes only.
That would be my guess. DFV alone would drive 100k share purchases, and there are tons of other 1/15 calls expiring tomorrow ITM
Mods can we ban this retard?
Damn just saw GME went up to 43 in AH lmao
Is Cramer a mod yet
VTV has a solid portfolio if you want an ETF, most of its top holdings are solid value + quality plays 

Otherwise you kindaaaa missed the best value investing time (March-october) when value companies were a lot cheaper. For example Disney was $120 now $175. JPM was $90 now $140. But my favorite companies that hit the ticker of not too high of a valuation (higher than a 25 pe and/or higher than a 2 PEG) are MRK, JPM (BAC, BLK and GS as well), UNH, LMT, GOLD, VRTX and BRK.B
Yeah GameStop’s been good... but have you seen BB?!? Fueling to go to the moon started today 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
My TLRY LEAPS are already 100% after 5 days 🥵

It’s always been a short term hold but this time might be different. They have only turned a profit 1 time until covid hit but since then they landed 2 huge contracts with more sustainable income coming in monthly with services. They seem to be interested in big time growth

Another soldier on the front!
Most countries have announced a hydrogen plan to go green Biden will too and PLUG will keep going up and they're gonna announce insane levels of yoy growth next earnings call. Can't believe real analysts gonna downgrade it and somehow were the retards!
Tesla up or down tomorrow?
Cramer snitching on us
LOCK THE GATES
😩I should've cashed out 50% when I just broke above even 2 or 3 times in the last 20 mins. Being greedy I thought " here we go we're taking off!" but then came back down and now red ah
Bbby short squeeze...
Shape up before you get diabetes

If you play it right then GME can be both of those.
V is free money

  rip clean energy, nothing in this bill for it.
  
Biden also plans to introduce a second economic recovery plan in the coming weeks that targets creating jobs and addresses climate change.
Bad bot
I’m a dumb ass what does limit price meannnnn
Bro it’s under a dollar lol
I’m not sure many will be able to even comprehend the words
Good bot
I may just start screen shotting and writing these names down. As well as adding tags to them. 

Which you should be adding tags to people so you can keep track of who is saying what and how you reacted.
This is such a fact it’s the next move you boomer fuck
Bruh, wtf is u doin. I pray this bitch hits 60 tomorrow and you make a god damn killing🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

All bb contracts will be up like 600% lmao
I literally have like 100 open, I am too scared to count, I just scroll. so much green.
So uh. 


Is WSB going to eventually end up as a SPAC because I'm getting that feeling.
Biden also plans to introduce a second economic recovery plan in the coming weeks that targets creating jobs and addresses climate change.
Shoulda bought the dip
New floor tomorrow at 40 after the drop from open, buy the dip
It's good. Normally boomers are to stubborn for wsb but your dad embraces the new era of trading so he is welcome on the rocket ride!
Not worth the risk at all
70% in a week on a rumor

*WHY ISNT GOING UP MORE*
Im new - can someone explain a little what happened?

1) how much did he pay for the calls?
2) how do I get the math in this chart? (Eg he has 1000 qty how do you get to millions in value?)
3) who is Melvin?
First rule of wsb...
If you missed gme buy puts now. That shit is going to drop faster than Donnie
You mean rocket??
I have 3k in a Roth IRA just sitting there. What should I do? I want a sit and forget move
Where do I put my newfound 10k from GME so I can buy a tesla and give my parents some money by the end of the year?
Holy shit GME gang we have lift off 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Why?
It's called GameStop because after this you're going to be so rich you won't be playing
Hello retarded dads. Welcome.
Is Cramer a mod or trying to start a new sub r/wallstreetcirclejerks ?
how to convert imperial inch to lady inch
I'll check back in December 2022 to confirm.
With 200k income... they are going to waste a lot on taxes doing the conversion ladder.
do it
If they offer shares before the squeeze, they will cuck us so hard.
fuck you.

Congrats.

Do no harm (unless it's to short sellers).
With a full tank at the beginning of their shift I don't think that happens often.  Probably have drones chasing us soon so perhaps car chases will be a thing of the past.
It’s not buying to manipulate the market retard, GME is a good company with good leadership so people wanted to buy the stock, it’s also illegal to sell naked shorts beyond the amount of shares available but Melvin did it
Yes
Been holding LXRX for 6 years now. Got f’d when they did a reverse split. This is the closest I’ve been to being green on this stock in a long time.
ya, I stop loss and loss.. was doing well this year until GME fomo, haha.. good wakeup call
Damn Cramer gonna blow this place up. He even knows about the rocket emojis!!!
that's just his TV shtick. he's all adderall and hookers off-camera
Trying to avoid fomoing in too late on GME. I keep thinking the tech dip is over, and then the dip continues!
I’m trying to turn fun money into student loan payments not a lot at stake here

This is me tonight with my 100 contracts of SPCE $50
Okay I was pretty sure, but good to have confirmation. Thanks. Anyways, GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
If Cramer were an anime he'd get a Ritalin-addicted WSB zoomer assigned to him by the network to co-anchor
It's a super longterm hold. Degenerates here don't have that patience.

You can buy options any strike over 30 for year Jan 2022 and 2023. It will print massively!
So did Cramerica pull through for GME? I was on a flight and couldn’t catch it

We don't need to ask why it's there, we already seen this video a lot of times in a lot of variations.
Fuck off, thats enough money to buy your girlfriend and your mom with a couple grand to spare
How can I regret it that's all I can afford.

Would be great but probably not
As long as you don't buy and sell the same equity/instrument the same day you are good (atleast until you hit a million). As for DD don't mention that, as the more work you do, the more of a job it is, which is the criteria for not being an individual tfsa. Remember you can't sell cash covered puts, but you can sell cash covered calls, and can only trade equity/instruments that are available on the listed exchanges (ie: no otc).
This post was 100% a flex of ur setup, but it’s nice nevertheless.
They better pay me in pltr shares... hopefully lin is cool with it
Bought BB after hours after hearing about it all day and it’s still been mooning... what the hell!
That's like crying during sex, and for the wrong reasons. But I'd still take it.

I didn't buy the option back, but even if I had this morning first thing it would have worked out even better (hindsight being what it is, of course). I also thought about rolling it over to a Feb option, but at this point that strategy would have just compounded my losses. I'm just gonna take my win, hopefully learn a lesson, and try not to cry during sex.
Calls are infinite money
I'm not denying that at all but I wouldn't want to take that risk uncovered is all just in case something even more crazy were to happen.
This sub has long forgotten about TSLA. What is it? We only talk about GME now
Ironically, Luckin coffee is also up 25% for the week.
What am I supposed to buy tomorrow? BBBY, GME, or BB? Too many shorts not enough money.

I’ve just about had it with these s***nugget banks come out with these arbitrary numbers
How do I always pick stocks that go red right away and fade into nothing
I had sold all my shares and took profits before it went down around that time, but I bought that 4-month out call around then since I was hoping for a steady recovery. I'm not even gonna cry about it, it was a informed decision and pretty rational from PLTR's behavior and news on gaining contracts to buy it.
Oh, fuck me [I am retarded.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYmn3Gwn3oI)  
Thank you for helping me become slightly less retarded this evening.
Should we start investing into renewable now or wait

Why PLTR? Wasn’t it downgraded recently?
God I hate you. I too fell for the trap and joined the med school train years ago. They didn’t have you wsb f-ers back then so I left that damn place -$118k.

Not to the sub, but if they find out that a hedge fund is masquerading as someone on here and trying to influence things then they could maybe bust some kneecaps.
&#x200B;

im new here how TF do you place a call order. I used fidelity and robinhood
I will take your money if you wanna sign me
that's the way
Not necessarily if the stock is highly liquid, also borrow costs can be effected by other things like recently issued stock is harder to borrow.
Which sucks because you can't even bet against this and win.

Excellent plan!!!
Land a new job in a derivatives trading department.
this is why you hold when others panic sell. take notes retards.
I agree.

But I also see a company like NKLA which is a proven fraud still trading at 2/3 of their ipo price months after the fraud was announced.

The amount of dumb money in the market can sustain this valuation for an uncomfortably long time.

My primary position is Aug 110p, not sure how smart that is anymore, but I’m waiting for the ipo lockup in March before making any correction.
I just watched jimmy chill talk about this situation on mad money. 

It's funny how shorting a stock is ok... But what has been happening here is questionable. 

Keep it up folks those short people are doing the same thing you are but with leverage from the market makers. 

Hopefully the company doesn't print any shares while it keeps going up.
Holy shit the WSB ETF must be fucking ripping right now
I was going to question whether shorting struggling companies was no longer a viable strategy in the age of social media with all these turnaround tickers, but then I remembered Melvin have been making $$$ for years shorting GME and they just didn't keep on top of their DD/got greedy.
BB going to $30 EOM 🚀
Trust me. GME is going to the moon. You won’t regret it
COTY.  It's 1/3 the price it was 2 years ago and now they have the Jenners/Kardashians.

Someone should create a daily thread on WSB with the highest outstanding short float ratios. Or is there already a source to look that up?
BEARS OUT
The cost of doing business 🚀
Having a higher salary makes it easier but overall principles still apply (invest early and invest as much as you can).

So you might not be a quick as someone making 70-100k starting but you’ll still be able to FIRE reasonably.

That being said as long as you’re doing stem in a popular field (ME, EE, SWE) and are looking for jobs in a popular area 65-70k is *really* not that much for a company who’s paying most of its employees in the high 120-150ks
They've already blown every trial phase out of the water  
Not approved odds are the same as GME tanking
I agree with the general sentiment here; there is no perfect time, YMMV, and you sound emotionally and financially able.

I waited until I was nearly 40 to start. I'm mid-40s and had my third kid a few months ago. There are pros and cons. I'm pretty far along in my career and can get time away from work without risking stagnation. I have already built a fair NW and can afford pretty much whatever I want/need for the kids. On the other hand, damn is it tiring. I lift a few times a week and run/bike a few times a week, so I'm in reasonable shape, but damn is it tiring. And, I'll be in my 60s (!?!) when they leave for college. I also may not live long enough to see my grandkids.

FWIW - regardless on when you plan to start, if you're considering saving in a 529 plan, start now. You can open it in your name, put in whatever you can afford each month, and once you have your child, transfer it to them. This will give you potentially several additional years of saving for college for your kid(s).

Whatever you decide, it's a personal decision. There is no right or wrong time. You sound like you've got all the prerequisites covered.
This is my goal too. I'm starting med school in the Fall and hope to go in with hella gains on hand
I have joined bbby train as well to fuck Melvin. Enjoy losing money ya fucking elitist pricks
lol imagine... all the those 2k checks into GME shares! to the MOON!
Bold move... I am rooting for you all!
$SRNA was my ride today, honestly think it has a lot more gas left in the tank!
Funny commentaryu about 420.69 aside, this stock is going to keep going up like a rocket to at least 65 as long as everybody stays the course.

&#x200B;

Right now, the shorts are having to buy even MORE shorts further out in the hopes of leveraging their way down over time after we lose interest and sell.  But the more shorts they buy, the more we choke the market, and the more they have to buy...

&#x200B;

We're basically putting them through the same vicious cycle they have historically put retail investors through.
Do you even internet?
Raise your hand if you’re in GME calls but could be semi rich if you had gone all in 🙋🏻‍♂️
He also called us sketchy lol I’m wonder how this is going to affect the number of followers of this sub... gonna go over 2mil in a few days? What’s gonna happen
Pltr tomorrow let’s make this 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
We made it. I have tears in my eyes. I love u all
Sir yes sir
You won't profit from that trade haha
just use margin
There statements just show every individual trade you made in the last month, without showing account balance.
Calls on both!!
Sorry to disappoint my friend. I never took a stake in GME one way or the other, but congrats to everyone who was long this! I am pleased that my 3-mo return right now is sitting at +165%
BBBY up nearly 6% AH. My 30 FDs I bought today are really gonna print holy shiet
Be patient!! It will fly soon
Well the first bill destroyed jobs by raising the minimum wage to $15.

Here's to hoping the second bill removes the minimum wage entirely to stimulate job growth.  We can be a wonderful bastion of prosperity and employment like Singapore.
When are we selling
Check my post history I gave a nice breakdown
Get in $VSTO for earnings.

Yes.  Are you suggesting the Fed has hit more than 2% in target inflation?  Inflation isn’t measured by one asset class or even two.

I don’t think it’s the stock in particular but the industry.

My guess would be real estate in general is a bit iffy because of so many businesses shutting down, and people unable to pay rent. There is a lot less demand relative to supply for real estate right now.
3000 shares of LKCO
From a glance at your post history we work at the same company, so that'd do it!
Thanks man
Question on LEAPS pricing

Why is the break even on deep ITM LEAPS less than it is on OTM Leaps with the same expiration?

For instance: GME 230120C

$2 strike $37.90 cost = $39.90 break even

$10 strike $30.60 cost = $40.60 break even

$20 strike $25.75 cost = $45.75 break even

$40 strike $20.23 cost = $60.23 break even

$55 strike $15.63 cost = $70.63 break even

Aside from just buying the underlying, what am I missing?
What time am I selling my 49c tomorrow ? GME obviously
I’m jacked, IM JACKED TO THE TITS!!
BB
Watch his streams on YouTube, such a chill dude!
What's ur pt
TLRY or APHA, personally I prefer APHA
Fuck you guys. I quit WSB after cashing out the SPY train last year and now all my friends were asking me how to use Robinhood because of you guys.

Anyway I went deep in BB calls at open and now I am addicted again.
They might tho
Feels like so, not sure whether entering GME now is worth it though
Add the strike price and cost
you didnt, im at work, i cant find their statement. But I'm relatively certain that they are the ones who get to choose which strikes and expiries are available
Joe exotic?
So buy tomorrow morning?

False.
Truuueee.

thats right, but 2/19 is the way.

you want to start reading about options greeks. IV, theta, vega and gamma specifically. try investopedia
Add CCP somewhere in there.
can you elaborate on the 'still 30%" ? 
because of IV crush post ER? novice retard here. Trying to understand the math.

im so happy people are this dumb.

important people who work in legitimate offices and manage hundreds of millions of dollars got caught wrong footed and gotta pay with their blood.
For me I was watching at 26 but didn’t pull trigger till 36 like a monkey but I bought 150 shares at 36 and I’m well into the green so no complaints
Not getting shit under $40 now king
Hi! I would really like to try Blast Off 2021 for the money you’re asking. How can we go about it?
Excellent
So BB the play after GME 🚀🚀🚀
Do you a set stop loss?
Melvin has puts expiring tomorrow, retard. Their options are going to expire worthless. They don’t have an obligation to buy the underlying security.
15% in a bull market is normal. You’re forgetting that the benchmark average of 8-12% is accounting for red years as well. In a bull market it’s not uncommon for annual returns in the 20 and 30% ranges.
May be able to ride gme down tomorrow. I'm expecting a massive fight
Back into GME
Going nuclear, you decide 😂
Made my first bet today. Spent about an hour doing DD on this sub and then bought GME 55c 1/15 on RH. I have absolutely no clue what I’m doing, but I know I belong here.
Yup 🐷
good luck 🤞

I know this is a joke, but there's a glut of entry level software candidates, and the market has no interest in them. It only wants mid-level and senior devs. It's so disgustingly bottle-knecked. Basically the same way with a lot of educated professionals. Especially lawyers.
real question is is he gonna sell them before bc he'd have to buy all those contracts with cash lol
Asymmetric risk. Blow $50 on those lottery calls every month just in case.
I hope they aren't short BB as well. They might be in line for that 1,400 check
how do I long Pakistani gender studies?
I bought 5 GME 1/15 40c at a 0.03$. Up 10000%. What would you guys do? Sell at open or before close? I am not planning to excercise them, maybe one contract.
ain’t no way GME will go bankrupt before covid is gone
When you witnessed how violent they were with trying to cause sell offs and how the stock responded.

I could see my money going down but I had faith.

It wasn't convincing.

Wait they shorted BBBY too? LMAO. Bears about to get a lesson in the dangers of being gay.
Pure fire!🔥🔥🔥🔥🕶️🕶️🕶️🕶️🕶️🕶️🕶️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
True,  sliced apple in half, got rid of Microsoft, slapped into GME, and made more than those dinosaurs have in a year...
Yes
No they probably won’t. And it’s arguable that a raise of the minimum wage would actually cause inflation. In all likelihood the inflation fears from this change is totally blown out of proportion.
TENDIES TOMORROW!

This is fuckin hilarious
This is pretty much what my dreams look like.

Whenever Cramer vid is posted up don’t upvote that shit to r/all I like saying retard
Possibly
Elvin Capital sells a share to WSB autist at $40. If Elvin Capital sells 10M shares like that, then the price tanks.

Two days later when the clearing agency tries to deliver the shares to WSB autist broker account, but turns out Elvin Capital did not have the fucking shares, and issues an IOU, which needs to be settled ASAP. But it is already too late, because Elvin Capital's actions already impacted the price two days ago and put a massive brake on the momentum. 

This is called naked shortselling and it's illegal.

No sympathy here somebody called in about GameStop like six or eight weeks ago and Kramer said no
Oh sorry I didn’t understand your first message. Yes I’m aware of and have been investing in quite a few SPACs, I haven’t had problems with but maybe because I spend weeks on them before investing. Or do the ones I have friends involved in.

Everyone said Biden was announcing his infrastructure plan tonight, but what I'm seeing is its only his stimulus plan and the infrastructure one won't be released until Feb.

Hope you're not balls deep in clean energy still.

 BBBY calls actually free money 🤑 Without the IV crush of GME 🤤
you mean 420.69
Cant wait for arkx
Are you some kind of pervert
Google it ya retard
Lol. Tilray is flying flying
Please do, so ICLN can go up
So you didn’t buy it?!? Dude BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
u/DeepFuckingValue thinks he's so smart. Meanwhile the SEC is coming to arrest him.....and take his time machine. He played right into their hands.
It was only a matter of time before WSB takes over as the dominant trading platform.
Damn I can't stretch my balls enough to dip them in all these hot moon landing stocks
I’d like to be part of this group! Could you tell me more about the equitable arrangement? Thank you.
sick gains.  but to be honest making then wsj gonna put the spotlight on you from irs/sec so be careful bro.
Hey tesla everything is mooning but you. BB is up more dollar wise than you after hours and you are worth 80X it. Get your shit together pissy ass Elon
Deepfuckingvalue will be the host
Yeah until it dips into your stop loss and then reversed and keeps on climbing....
If everyone pushes their sell limit orders ridiculously high, shorts can’t borrow shares correct?
nothing sadder than selling BB calls this morning because they made 100% return and I was tired of losing money holding BB bags
amazing thank you
Hey guys my total gains % Since I started investing is 69.69%
I have $10k I can use tomorrow. I will be okay if I lose it all. What do you guys think I should go big in?
Like, actually a walk away move? Just chuck 75% of it into a total stock ETF and 25% into a bond ETF and come back when you retire.
Someone's a little salty today.  Did you manage to read beyond the title, or did I trigger you too hard?
There’s an ETF that only invests in companies run by women
Thanks
I don't think it's worth now. The fact that they celebrate their victory already.
Initially they he will probably get a small increase,  but not nearly what the minimum wage people will see.  It takes a long time for companies to be able to raise their prices enough to cover these spikes in costs.  I read an article that calls this “Wage Compression”....when the pay rates between the two tiers is artificially closed.  In my business it has taken a few years for me to be able to get back to similar percentages of different pay rates between my skilled and unskilled positions.
   This is just what I have seen in my business and local economy.

Because you buy after the moon. Smart money is in before the catalyst, stop FOMOing
So when you guys decide to finally take profits how badly is GME gonna tank? Anybody gonna try and ride it down?
Thanks man
Yes and he drinks Diet Coke like all Boomers
We're self-admitted retards, so I think there's some federal protection for us.
So I bought in literally right after the bell for 10c at .84 cents. Am I fucked now bc I didn’t do it during hours? I can’t see this going through
Wtf if you want to fuck melvin you have to buy GME shares
I think I’m gonna let you guys finish this ride and watch from the sidelines. This is a little to crazy looking for me to feel comfortable with.
Avoiding oil/gas and finance leaves a lot of money on the table. I have stocks that have  more than doubled or tripled in Oil/Gas and doubled in finance. They still have upside from here. Plus dividends tend to be generous.
we need a bloomberg terminal! to get real time short floats. But we get the bi-monthly ones

Damn that sucks. Robinhood might not offer this ETF. My friend who works in ICT recommended me this and I looked into it. Fund was started in May 2020 and is already up 90% and still extremely underpriced
No one cares about TSLA anymore. GME is our main chick right now.
51 shares @ 3.72 back in August 2019. It's been a wild ride up to this point. Hoping we can go even further.
I live in a state where it's $15 an hour and it resulted in more minimum wage workers getting fired than anything. Less workers at McDonalds these days, they have kiosks to order, and higher prices.
Changes to their board
Aight help me with this. Let's say GME hits 53 tomorrow right? And I have 2 contracts. That's basically only 2000 bucks. I get what I paid for it back too right? So like ~2500?

Am I missing anything?

Ahh ya, you're golden dude. Do whatever makes you happy. Maybe that's work. Maybe it's retirement. If one doesn't work, go back to the other. Can try to get part time as well. The world is your oyster, congrats! :)
If GME doesn’t hold these gains or goes a bit into red it’s gonna be a bloodbath
So funny thing, this doesn't actually work. I messed around with it after this post. RH wont let you buy a call and sell weeklies against it for less than the strike of the call. for obvious reasons.
My dude that is the way. I thought I was gambling when I bought em at $15
I'm not educated how is this pumping money into bb

What are the expectations surrounding bank earnings. I see they are hot stocks right now because of buyback allowances. What do the fundamentals say?
Maybe, today was pretty green so this might have been priced in.
Although fundamentals aren't a big part of my system I agree with everything you said. I've been selling USDCAD for the last month, plenty more room for usd to fall in my opinion

In the article it says Cohen bought 9% of the GME with 5.8 million shares for roughly ~ $5.39 a share or $31.26 million. 

At $42.80 after hours that is now almost $250 million.

That’s a 700% gain.
Bought in after some DD on WSB last week:

30 1/21/22 10c +86% today
40 1/21/22 12.5c +108% today

It ain't much, but LEAPs be that way I guess.

Good luck! I did my undergrad in econ and finance, and I'm headed back for my masters of accounting this summer.
My thought is if I exercise the call and have shares I can write weekly calls while the IV is high. Write like a 13 call for next week. Probably collect $200 to write it in the morning and then worst case scenario the stock closes over 13 next week and I sell my shares for 13 still making another 500
Yup, bigtime

It's up less than a %after hours...
V & MA are up on the year with having lost fairly significant revenue/income yoy in 2020, that’s actually pretty incredible. Even then 2021 going forward should be better for them with more shift away from cash.

MSFT & AMZN had fantastic run ups in the past year, a consolidation period is good for them.
You should also know that I have no fucking idea what I’m talking about, I bought 1/15 40c at 30 and sold at 34 yesterday.
I watched this and didn’t react this morning like an idiot.
BB
For me, today's show  (so far) is exactly what I'm looking for. No negativity. His explanation of the short squeeze was supplemented by his real world experience and we couldn't have gotten that story from anyone else. The definition, sure we can use google, but the definition along with Cramer's experience with the banks? That's unique to his show.

Cramer has always been one of my favorites, and that's why I felt so slighted when he started trashing on us. I hope everyone else is pleased with is recent change as well.
Serious question. Normally it would take 6 days for shorts to cover because of our 7 million average volume however today our volume was 100 million. Wouldn't that mean the squeeze would last a day?.

CD7. I see them going back to 80-ish soon.
Just happened to me recently because after hours bullshit with MARA, got in around 15, had a trailing limit and it opened down when BTC dumped, but Mara recovered the same day, before I got back in the price was like $24, missed out on pretty much $5/share because of that lapse in time. Lesson learned, prob only set them if I’m on vacation in the future

No need to be included in that bill since he can do that himself without congress
Suppose there are only 100k people investing based on wsb memes and each person is poor so they have only 10k. That's GME's market cap a few months ago. Even though I'm just making up numbers I think they illustrate the point that WSB has a significant amount of capital reading the sub. Combined with the short squeeze effect I don't think it's unreasonable to say WSB played a big role in GME booming.
started doing that today
Is $BB mooning because people think it stands for BlockBuster?

What time do we close the position & open a new one for next week, for optimal tendies ?
I hope zjz and his bot army can take care of us, I would hate to think the big boys use the sub and start manipulating it, commercialising it.

Thank you very much. So far I’m pretty new to the game. I still have plenty to learn, not fully understanding options / spacs.
You really have to ask? Come on, you know the answer to the question.
GME is the ultimate stock russian roulette, those who timed right and sold for a profit and those who baghold and are sucking dick behind a wendy's for rent.
Ofcourse. I am getting new $BNGO vibes from $CHEK. It's actual physical product and not some kind of medicine and stuff. Sooner or later they will be out in news with their FDA approval and stuff and this thing is gonna sky rocket.

Fellow 57 y.o. here in the same boat! My husband (53) and I basically did the same thing — invested in our 401(k)s as our primary savings (started when I was 25 I think), and then ... just made more money than we spent.  I have received a lot of stock from my company and the company has done well, and this has made all the difference for us because we are really not financially-focused people.  We finally hooked in with a financial planner a few years ago with the plan being to figure out how to make sure we could retire someday and if there was any chance of doing it in our 50s, and he kind of laughed at us (kindly) for being so worried.  He looked at our net worth (which is about $3M at the moment) and was like, you guys, you can absolutely retire in your 50s. We never dreamed we’d be in this position, seeing as we haven’t exactly been deliberate about it.  So we’re thrilled ... But we don’t know what we will retire TO, so it’s weird.  I definitely want to stop working my high-powered job and my husband is just done as well, but we have no plan except to be done with working in about a year.  ANYWAY, congrats on realizing you may be closer than you think.
Give me a reason BB is a buy cuz I plan on putting my entire portfolio in it

Quick dumb question about return on investment.

When calculating your max return on investment when selling a cash secured Put, do you use the full collateral as the denominator or do you use the collateral less the premium earned?

For example: If I sell a $10P for $2 in premium, is my max return on investment:

*  $2/$10 = 20%, OR is it 
* $2/($10-$2) = 25%.

I've always worked it out the first way, but it occurred to me that if I get to reinvest the premium does that mean my collateral is actually net of premium?

Also, how do you calculate ROI on covered calls?

Thanks in advance

I have 16k in 1/29 TSLA calls. I was thinking of selling and getting 1/29 55C GME tomorrow.
Hit the button man. Just hit the button.
That’s what I’d like to start doing. I don’t have a lot but that’s not what’s holding my me back. Trying to learn Paytience and I’m not even playing
Maybe something in https://sec.report
Already been on an uptrend. gained [100k](https://subredditstats.com/r/wallstreetbets) in the last 30 days.
Why
Hold till April at least
If the stock goes up, i'm a genius.

If the stock goes down, market manipulation.

Seriously, as a beginner I threw some money at Tesla for 2 days and made 160. Did I know what I was doing? Absolutely not. Took an uncalculated risk and it paid off - do I get to be smug about it now?
It feels kinda unreal more than doubling my net worth so I’m still kinda struck
There’s going to be a lot of GME bagholders tomorrow, no matter how high it goes

Michael Burry was on GME and BBBY.

Moral of the story to me: follow Michael Burry. The financial crisis was one thing, but here he is back to picking super cheap stonks.
GO EV shitting the bed again today. When is this Bangbus partnership being announced already?
Are you saying that reading 10ks is not what you should be doing? are you suggesting that you should be following good hedge funds and just making the same moves as them? Let me know how you track the best hedge funds, I bet that is really easy information to find. Let me know which managers have the best track record. It's too funny how naïve you are honestly. Are you saying that you cannot have a theory on the future of a company, and make accurate predictions based on that? You think hedge funds conduct their own market trend research? "The best stock pickers in the world are hedge funds". This might single handedly be the funniest thing I have ever heard, gratz

Y'all really think BB is going to continue mooning after market open tomorrow?
The only difference is my bank account has only $178 in it 🤷🏻‍♂️
I mean it did already run from 10 to 30...

....but yes, time to resume mooning
If you want clean energy to stick , stop voting for old people who will never see the devastation of their short sighted policies because they will be long gone....
I was actually reading about them before I dove in, this just seems like a ridiculously rare opportunity and was looking to get in for as cheap as possible just to follow it.

I understand I could very well lose all $300 but it's like 0.1% of my portfolio, so willing to shoot for the moon here. I want to try and clear up capital early tomorrow but I fear that the shares are gonna spike early/pre market.

I took a “short” breather for the holidays and didn’t keep up with news. Missed out on the fact that RC joined. I would’ve all in’d at that point. Anyone else feel extreme anxiety from missing out on an easy play?

It’s tough to say because a lot of companies use degree requirements to source the *best* candidates, not just the ones qualified for the job.


$18/hr sounds pretty low for a degreed programmer tbh if that’s truly what’s required.

I think companies paying in that range are going to have to either raise rates or lower their expectations.
I just checked your post history ...it definitely was. 

also, I love you too. Regardless if my LUMN te dies print ;)
i hope everyone understands what's happening here. shorts are driving up price in after market to try and catalyst downward spiral at open. that's exactly what happened this morning

It’s over for us lads.
Probably the same $75K, but this is a proposal- have to actually go through congress and the senate to pass the free money drop...
Small?  Why not have conviction in your belief and go all in on the short.   I mean you just said no company has run up like this and it not pop.   And I never said that the bubble won't pop.  It will if it is a bubble.   See the difference here?  I am long Tesla and I will not even make the prediction one way or another as I am not stupid enough to believe I can time the market in any significant way.   If you do that it is much more likely you got lucky then just your amazing ability made you money.   I mean if most people could successfully do that consistently they would be billionaires.    

The nature of predictions is idiotic.   If you say something enough it will probably come true.   But if you make a prediction 10 times and are right once you are pretty shit at predictions.    More important then knowing if there is a bubble is when it will pop.    That is the thing here.   You could be completely right  that it will happen but if you are a month early then you were wrong.  Doesn't matter if you called it.  Timing is everything and if you don't get that right the rest of teh prediction is useless. 

It is like saying that historically that the stock market has crashes or the economy has recessions.   Well thanks for letting all of us know this information that everyone knows.   What matters is not that it happens it is when it will happen.   Do you not think that every long knows it is possible for the share price to pull back?   So until you can time it then making a prediction just so you can say told you so is meaningless.
We are getting invaded by newfriends
We aren't plotting to blow up shorts.  THey were fucked either way.  We are just riding along (and maybe making it a bit worse)
How much money you want ?
With a move of +50% in one day volatility spikes.

So examples- For the last week the price hasn't moved much so I say I'll sell you a call with a 50$ premium because it will probably expire worthless. You don't buy it. 

After the price doubling I say-- "I don't want to sell you a call and only make 50$ off of it! That shit has the chance to maybe increase 200% or something. I'll sell it to you for 300$ premium now"

You buy it

But if the price stays flat for a day or two after you buy then what are chances it will change drastically? Probably less. So now this other person comes along and says - "Fuck you! I'm not paying 300$ premium. It has barely moved up the last two days and it will probably expire worthless. I'll give you 100$ premium."

So maybe it moved in the direction you wanted but you still lost money because you bought a call when there was a big chance it would moon.

Hope this helps
Yooooo, I thought I put in more months ago but it's was sadly a few shares. Still happy to see it boomin though!

That's just not true at all. Expected console sales were already priced in. It's not like the console release was a surprise that came out of nowhere. It's pretty well known gme didn't get many given to their stores too. That exact number won't even be released till April. 

The short squeeze hasn't even happened yet either. 

The only big catalyst is Cohen and the two other chief executives joining leadership to rebuild gme's business model.

Hello fellow retards

I agree, my thinking now is that government and central banks will do whatever they need to do to keep things going. The low rates help a lot because borrowing is basically for free.

Then we will get the post COVID boom. People are sick of being locked up and not being free. They will go in overdrive when vaccins are done and Covid is under control. 

But then it is time to make sure you leave the party before everyone wants to get out. Exact timing is hard.. I learned that the market can be irrational for a looong time. The challenge is set.
Oh well that’s my view on it, we will see what the future brings. If vaccins start failing or mutations get out of hand, this story will play out differently.

2k please and I’ll have enough to move out of this shit apartment
I'm sorry brother
I suppose this is considered DD from a stock valuation standard which isn't wrong in the current way the market is operating. I don't personally consider this a DD because I look at fundementals; which I know is out of the window in the current market.

I get that this person is joining and he could be switching the company around, but there is 0 mention of an actual laid out plan in place of what to do with the company.

You could say it will become an AI 5G Machine Learning lemonade selling only fans account. Who cares? We don't own the company and whatever day dreams people have of what it should do does not result in what it WILL be. Only owners/execs can decide what it will become and there is yet to be a vision on that.

P.S. When I say plan, I mean something like what AMD has. I invested in 2017 because I saw their CPU, it was a testable product, I saw their competition, and I can actually research their plan. That was an excellent buy. I can't say the same about GME, there doesn't seem to be any legitimate plans.

Thanks for sharing that link and congrats on the gains.
I spent my first 6 years post college making 30-40k a year (PhD program). You want one of two things: 1) a job you enjoy so much that you don’t need to rush to retirement because it isn’t soul crushing, and hell, you might even keep doing it even after you read fi or 2) a high income so you can minimize the length of your working career. 

There’s no way around the income part when it comes to early retirement, save for if you compensate by living a (sometimes prohibitively) frugal lifestyle. I sacrificed some of (2) in order to get more of (1) personally so if marketing suits you that should be sufficient. But for me the goal is happiness over FI. FWIW, I wholeheartedly recommend that outlook to others :)
This is the way.
For me, today's show  (so far) is exactly what I'm looking for. No negativity. His explanation of the short squeeze was supplemented by his real world experience and we couldn't have gotten that story from anyone else. The definition, sure we can use google, but the definition along with Cramer's experience with the banks? That's unique to his show.

Cramer has always been one of my favorites, and that's why I felt so slighted when he started trashing on us. I hope everyone else is pleased with is recent change as well.
Whats yalls BB price target?
I feel you, I even had some GME calls but sold them like a week ago. Seeing all this gains porn is like torture
We can just use Parler. I hear its cool.

Price increase as a combination of covering their soon expiring short position by buying the stock AND due to delta hedging by market makers.

A large put position can be supplied by market makers however, market makers aim to be delta neutral. Simply, when market makers sell a put they in effect take a "bullish" position therefore, to be neutral, they need to offset this with a "bearish" position by shorting the stock. When market makers start selling calls to those wanting to get into the price action from short covering, this bearish position can also be offset by the market makers being long on the stock, which in turn, can further exacerbate the upward price movement.

Tldr: GME 🚀🚀🚀 bc of 🌈🐻 covering their expiring puts by buying the stock, which is amplified by market makers buying more stock.
How can is be stupid when GME will rise maybe 20% and ATVK maybe 100%

I don’t mean to be a downer, but I have the sense the market has been hanging on to these levels by a thread and after Biden unveils his plan tonight... the “sell the news” part will happen.

Especially considering the short squeeze effect our 10% plays a significant role.
If that happens WSB becomes the new stock market bell-weather.
At this point there are like 9 of them don’t worry about it

I checked SHO too today. At one point it has to have some sort of impact.

Anyone have any thoughts on AMC? It's one of the last cinema stocks still standing + with the vaccine rollout this year it makes me think it might have a bounce back after dems open up cities now that Trump is gone

Anyone loading up on calls for this weekend? I was an idiot staring at 1-15 39c GME calls before close and didn’t buy. Same for BB. Am I too late for anything else fun this last day / weekend? Need something to throw money at.  GME got dopamine going brrrrrrrr
lmao. i truly hope this was a serious question. that is peak
What’s the thoughts on PLTR? Is it heading for $30 after demo day or overhyped? I really need a run from it.

Although the gains aren't quite as flashy as Weekly's, you can make a shit ton of money off of them. Leaps are great for that. As soon as the stock price passes your strike price you not only virtually negate Theta Decay, you also start to see massive jumps in gains

As it gets deeper in the money, you're leveraging that against the stock gains. $1 stock gain should net $1 intrinsic value gain in premium, or $100 overall gain on the leap

Now it's a serious question. I'm retarded plz
Dude people have been saying the market is “undeniably overvalued” and “due for a crash any day now” since like the 80s. Once you get over yourself you’ll realize that investing isn’t a straight up guaranteed 10% a year for life game and that there are going to be down periods. The best thing to do is own your assets. If you held and continued buying in the 2000’s you were rewarded nicely in the 2010’s. 

The whole point of an s&p500 etf is that you hold it for several decades and let it do it’s thing.
Market cap and I believe SPACs aren't allowed?
Fundamentals are fake and gay.
What should we do with nio? Hold or sell?
Very similar to my portfolio and I'm in my 30's, so maybe I'm biased, but solid and safe. Long term dividend gains will put you in a good spot, legitimately a set it and forget it portfolio. Genuine question: why Pepsi over Coke?
Before the SEC shuts us down (it’ll happen if we keep trapping billion dollar institutions short positions), they will have a few super secret agents in here trying to figure us out. Hint they won’t but that said, be careful. Some people may not seem who they actually are. Don’t get poisoned

I updated my post to include that, thanks.

Of the 30B, 25B is for rental assistance and 5B is for water/energy assistance. A portion of the latter (unspecified amount) is directed toward clean energy investment.

Where do you guys see GME tomorrow?
>They’re not trying to overthrow the government right?

They’re going to spend their own money to travel to DC, on the day of inauguration, armed, to fight for control of the country. Not as an excuse to break things

I'm thinking they still might be trying to hold down a bunch of calls that were bought during it's initial run-up. Might be a month before it goes up bigly.

We should definitely call that shit out. Also call out pumpers who like to do 1 day pumps and make tons of bag holders.

GME is a good example of people being honest as they can and i feel will call out when its time to exit.

WSB should move together on stocks, an autist collective. Fucking MM killing ninjas
Yesss
Do you degenerates realize that not only have we pumped GME to our glorious benefit but we have also called out the Crammer so much that he and his boomer network have capitulated to our will and SAID OUR FUCKING NAME.

THAT is WSB.

Big time moon.
Both. Cramer just hyped the stock on tv so you have some hope.
Honestly I'd probably give myself the hall of shame flair every time my stocks drop to remind people: if I buy, your stock is guaranteed at the top and will plummet :)
PLTR is harder to squeeze. The market cap is much larger, so retail buying does have as much of an effect.
Yeah I've realized I'd be a lot richer if I let winners run. Even if I never sold anything I'd be better off. 

Take profits if you want,  but a good idea doesn't stop being a good idea if it's run up. I also try to invest in companies that I'd be fine leaving alone if I went into a coma, less in ones that I'm twitchy looking for a one day pop.
Yooo I’m new to stocks what does 3/19 mean and what do calls mean
I just yolod this same call
Fuck yeah. Love this sub 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
is it too late?
I fucking wish it would move that much. I've got ammo to buy the dip but it dips to like 24.50 and comes back to 25 every day.
You bet we are succeeding. You can buy some shares too Cramer, if you would like to succeed with us.

Anyone else buying more tkmorrow or did it peak?!
Its not too late
do you have a stop loss? do you cross fingers and hope it goes back up?
I'm holding, it has a lot of room for growth.
That’s not a logical analysis. If Italy and USA couldn’t detect the new coronavirus in November/December 2019, why aren’t people saying that “US and Italy hid the virus”?

Fact is that China was more competent in detecting the new virus, sequencing the genome in record 12 days, and figuring out the ways to contain the virus.

US media:

“CCP has lost its heavenly mandate”

“Novel coronavirus is China’s Chernobyl“

“Democracies Are Better at Fighting Outbreaks”

“China is Asia’s sick man” (referring to a racist trope from the Century of Humiliation)

“Coronavirus will end China’s role as global manufacturing hub“
Thats why I'm getting in BB early. I can't take risks on GME but I'm happy to wait on the launch pad of BB until take off

Why would it not hold the gains tho
Guys, we can’t just organize and pump and stock with a high short interest. First, it isn’t that easy. You need a stock with some ACTUAL reason to rise to get a squeeze going. And second, it’s illegal
I do just fine with my degrees, as do many others, and they are valued valued by society. People would still like a policy that deals with the largest source of personal debt in the country.

This already happens. Do you think it was *people* who bought SGNL off Elon Musk’s tweet?
You need to replace the whole unit, per motherboard:

>The issue is with a flash storage chip called the eMMC that is embedded on a board called the MCU1. According to experts who have studied the problem, Teslas are writing vehicle logs to this flash storage chip so much that it eventually goes bad. The issue has been known in the Tesla community since at least May, when Tesla repair YouTuber Rich Benoit spoke to another Tesla repair professional named Phil Sadow about it in a video.

It's embedded, so it's not an easy fix.
Le chiffré did nothing wrong

Absolutely. Eventually we will have to pay for this money printing though. I’m not too worried about the short term but 20-30 years from now? It scares me to think about.

I just want to say, I love you all
This is the better question.
it says "value investing". I feel robbed.
To be fair, there’s value in learning from your mistakes and there’s value in being cautious too. Those who do neither will continue to fall until someone steps in. It sounds like you might want to talk to your aunt, if her finances matter to you or you care about the impact, about being more conservative, taking a different approach, or avoiding trading entirely. 

When the euphoria of this sub gets the best of you and you do a YOLO based on no conviction of your own only for it to plummet, that learning experience is invaluable because it gives you the opportunity to develop your mindset and look at similar scenarios with experience.

this is just the beginning of the fun for GME. You think riding the rocket is fun? Imagine seeing the reactions when the rocket explodes. Grab your popcorn gents.
Guess we will see tomorrow morning... but right now I’m looking at some pretty steep losses.

Huge run on GME, let’s start to sell and look flat better options. SRPT. 4,000% short interest.
I love the GME gains that ya'll are sharing. I will like the FOMO loss porn better though.
I still have clean energy contracts more money for the fucking Gme boys!!!
True, but even failures caused by sequence of returns risk in the first few years often don't actually "happen" until 20+ years later, by which point you're pulling on SS. Even with only a 75% payout, Social Security benefits are too high to completely ignore either. For lower absolute withdrawal numbers/expenses, SS offers a relatively larger replacement of income. Not super relevant if you're retiring at 30 and your model fails by 60, but if you're retiring at  40 it seems reasonably to at least consider it a factor.
this is the geekiest thing ive seen in a long time.

It just means I keep stacking until the end of 2022
That actually wasn't planned... I think my SPCE stock was leaking...

“Crashing”
Completely understand. I am extremely, relatively, new to all of this. I do read a shit ton all day while I’m working from home during the pandemic. I browse the internet, utilize Reddit a ton (shout out everyone here for the efforts), and other forms of DD.

I only recently started trying this penny stock thing out - like literally maybe 1-2-3 weeks ago?.. After getting a good foundation of diversified companies in my portfolio (TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, AMD, NGM etc), I saw the opportunity to play with some cash I (hypothetically) earned from them. I saw a post on something that caught my eye. I believe it was TLSS, PTE, or BBI. I’ve researched up a ton on this and read many of the DD posts here.. 

I also bounce the ideas off of some acquaintances who are in the healthcare industry, so the bio/pharma/medical companies.

Long story short, these cheap penny stocks can make pretty fantastic money (in my opinion) from the looks of things (if they check out of course). Say you have 2-300$ to play with and you think all of your research is making sense, timing seems good, there may be an opportunity. Make sure the management is aligned with their shareholders and are mutually respected/admired for their work ethic and that WE believe in them!

There are some opportunities that just by hearing the premise of the business, I have put say 200$ into it. I will say most of these have impressed me so far. 

Best of luck to you! Feel free to ask any other questions and I’ll try to answer them for you.

So the short sellers are buying GME?

If I knew for sure I was rich. I believe it has a future, do I took a position. But only for 50% of what I want to invest in it. I keep the rest in cash and wait it out a little. I am in there making money, but if it dips or corrects I can buy some more at much cheaper prices. 
If you believe in the theme, then time in the market is better then timing the market mate ;-)

Probably will regret selling tomorrow, but I flipped 1000 shares of GME in afterhours. Bought at 42 and sold at 43. Tomorrow it will open at 47 and I'll curse my past self.

I think this will help answer your question: [https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) Bottom line is that being able to FIRE is about saving more than you spend, enough that eventually, your savings can cover your spending. This is, of course, easiest when you make way more money than you would even want to spend....like I'm happy spending $30k/year for both of us; if I had a job making $500k/year, I'd have no clue what to spend it on, so I'd instantly be saving more in a year than I have in my lifetime to date! So, you see lots of high-salary people doing FIRE.

But, you can do FIRE with a low salary, too, you just have to be able to live with an even lower standard of living. For example, if you can earn $40k post-tax, and live on $30k like I do, then you'd be able to save 25% of your pay every year. Checking the simple math in that article I linked, you'd be able to retire after 32 years when saving 25%, so you'd be able to retire around age 55 if you start around age 22/23. Still early! Hopefully $40k isn't your permanent salary, though; let's say you start at $40k, but work hard, and get promoted, and are at $60k after 5 years. At $60k, if you can save 50%, you're on track for just 17 years, which would be age 40-ish. And so on; more income and/or lower expenses accelerates FIRE!

Anyone who can earn more than they spend, and save the difference, is on track to retire earlier/better than those who spend everything. So the mere fact you're thinking about this is a good sign you're ahead of average!
I did too but man it only took me about two trades to figure out that patience is needed lol. If it takes a whole year to figure out stock market basics then stock market may not be for that person
no one is reading the article.  it says they will announce new membership types later.  This might be good for holders later since they might limit crowds in this way
thats like 50% more than we give to coal and oil every year...need a bit more to justify staying in icln
Thank you!!

Anybody got etrade? 

Do options in etrade automatically try to sell on Friday 3pm like robinhood?
how is that percentage calculated? What did you pay for the call and what's the target? 
can you explain to me: options are shares make the same amount of money or not? 

let's say the stock is $10, and you have $20 call. 

* you buy 100 shares for $10 (-$1k) and sell for $20 (+$2k) you made $1k profit

* you buy a $20 call for $X (idk how much, but i assume not much, say -$100). Then you exercise the call to get 100 shares, you pay -$900 ( $10*100 - what you already paid, correct?) and sell for +$2k). It's the same $1k profit right? 

So the percentage you listed is the difference between call cost ($100) and net profit ($1000)?? So in this example it's 900%?
Eat clean tren hard

Robinhood account lookin somethin like a crystal ball
Idk to yolo into GME or BBY tomorrow
You can always open both accounts and trade real 0.01 lots on both at the same time and compare which one made more money at the end of the month. I mean, you take so many trades that even 1 week should be enough to make a decision.

For people who trade manually, they need an MT4 multi terminal or a trade copier like the one that Fxblue has for free.
About a month or two ago didn't some of them make a new sub?

Many will tell you to buy when a stock dips, but in the end its your choice. Watch the reddit here on the side, but filter through. There's a lot of bullshit calls/ memes.
Yeah I could see people selling at $100 but they will miss out, those shares are gonna get swooped up real quick by the shorts and then it’s gonna fly higher $420.69 or bust
Is this true?

Thanks!
I mean, lots of others giving non-banking advice here, but this is the simple and concise answer.
Meme stocks for a small chunks, but you define your risk tolerance. If you sell a put make sure you would have enough to buy 200 shares minimum in case it goes against you to average down. But everything from aapl to pltr to gme to rkt to amd to all these ev's to whatever you're bullish on
Hold with diamond hands?
What Wiki says that? That is incorrect. Short iron condors means two credit spreads which is routed for a credit. Long iron condor is two debit spreads and is routed for a debit.

How stupid am I for 1/15 10.5c bb
Then you just call him a pussy. Problem solved 😎
# Here's your playbook:

&#x200B;

1:  If you're thinking of selling GME, twist your own dick till it bleeds.  It will help you stop thinking about that.  That rocketship isn't even close to out of fuel yet.

&#x200B;

2:  September 15c's from BB.  Just shut up and do it, retard, and you might graduate to autist.

&#x200B;

3:  If you're in PLTR, just come to grips with the fact that you've been friend zoned and she doesn't love you.  Hasn't since Thanksgiving.  You're falling into the same trap that every other cuck did with MU for years.  Just stop.

&#x200B;

4:  If you want to act like a real pro for a moment and look smart, the 1/22 95c for AMD is a fucking outstanding value.  With the way semis have moved up today but how AMD didn't follow, it should be absolutely no fucking problem whatsoever to retrace back to that level in a short week.
Don’t worry you will get the balls oneday

What do you think about the potential risk of the full blue gov potentially cutting military spending?
1- yes it's not cluttered now so that's great.  I'd say consider Ameritrades tos, IB's tws, Schwab's SSE as you think about clutter.  All 3 do a pretty good job of offering tons of customizable options (no pun intended) without feeling too cluttered. 

2- nice!

3-  good to know! 

4-  yeah multiple expirations can be common amongst more experienced traders 

5-  I think I see what you're saying, but still not completely following you here.  I can think of 3 ideas for this, one of which you mentioned; 1-  when option one (or strategy one) expires, you simply remove it from the board, and everything from that date forward only reflects any open contracts, or, 2- when option one (or strategy one) expires, you just leave it in there so it's reflective of all strategies, or, 3- your idea of hovering over the date/price so as to see the difference (profit/loss with all strategies, or just current/open strategy).  I think option 3 would be great.  Would allow you to see everything at once, very powerful.  I was actually trying to do this earlier with one of my trades, as it has multiple legs and expirations.  I currently use a hand calculator to figure out what P&L looks like lol.

6-  I think you nailed it with the double slider idea.  It's perfect.  Wouldn't clutter and super easy & intuitive to use.  The other site is annoying cause you have to manually type in the range and the range changes on you to strange numbers when you make adjustments to the strategy.
Ill hold your dick while you piss if we hit 420.69 tomorrow
Never!

They announced today confirmation of their biggest ever contract, the biggest one prior today was last August, website seems stellar and they are a pick and shovel play for weed, Biden’s in weed is a good play. I got in at 0.098 today watched it drop down into the low 0.08 and only could add a bit more as had no cash left on my trading account. I have high hopes for this.
Boomer move. Mustang mach e looks gay af but it could be a boost

So, if you were Melvin, and you wanted to bust our asses, what would be the most effective way to do it? I'm thinking it would be to kill the price after hours, or over the weekend. Could they pull it off? And if so, how would you defend against that? Any other ideas of how they could do damage?
I appreciate it

You're still the retard. But congrats on the gains

Plenty. It's Gigachad time
Considering it a bond has been suggested before, though I'm not sure how that actually works.  Some also suggest to count the estimated payout as fixed income that reduces your overall FI number.
Proud of you.
Thanks
Fk. I need to reinstall now.
I mean, throw a dart at a board with symbols on it and you’d probably have turned a profit in the last year. I don’t know that I believe 350%, but I do know that don’t not believe it’s possible.
Remember the WSB way for all the new guys incoming. What’s FD mean? What’s a put? What’s IV? “NOBODY TELL HIM!”
i think its a slow double squeeze, short squeeze + gamma squeeze with a hint of genuine investment in a turn around situation. Based on metrics alone gamestop could make a comeback no squeeze required, but im not too invested in that story because that story would take months and years to play out.
Also remember, there's almost 2 million people here. When everybody goes on the same stock, the stock might move just because of the sheer volume of that.
I got in between .001 and .002 back in the summer, $20k in realized profits (pre-tax), and $45k unrealized. I’m strapped in for the rest of this ride.
I’ll buy bb but I’ll hold, thanks
The influx of retards makes me more confident about my calls
I've made 40k over the last 1M and the government is going to send me another 2k for doing nothing.

Thanks Buyden!
Not to mention the whole industry is moving to ARM. Apple showed the whole industry ARM isn't just a mobile chip. We may see ARM chips in the data center with Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia. I'm really hoping AMD has a plan for this. It was my first stock and I don't want to see it go the way of Intel.
That actually makes sense.
Thank you.
I’ll throw 100 on some FD’s
I bet it will go on forever!
Fuck yeah man congrats
This is the way.
What makes you say this besides your own retarded intuition?
Literally just got my income tax from NYS that I applied for in April. $4.20 lol, New York fucking me all up with their taxes
won't this squeeze have to happen sooner than later (e.g. \~1 week?)

wouldn't it be better to just get like 50 shares at open (\~$40) and then the YOLO 1/22 calls?
Lol my bad - I should’ve said all that - so 
23 - -17,000 in loans/CC bills - I make about $20,000 a year - and I have absolutely no money rn in any account. 
I want to take minimal risk if investing money and obviously pay off my bills. Other than that idk how to maximize it
Why not, let’s pump this shit up
Can you explain this before I throw shit around my house from excitement
I see you know how to math.  Hmmm. Good show.
Why does it gotta be September calls on BB?
what is the app called?
Would love to see this with a daily loss porn segment. Like a weatherman reporting the news except I’m sitting in a chair fapping away with one hand with the other explaining each screenshot.
He's counting stimmy bills
Swapped, they are in cybersec, electric cars and software. They also just sold like 70 patterns to Huawei.
Fortunately those who are already on reddit already know about WSB, and also those who watch Cramer that are *not* on reddit are likely boomers who have no idea how to navigate the interwebs.

We should be ight

The fuck are you talking about? No one is shorting XL how is going to squeeze??
Spy $380c expiring tomorrow, lets get this dub bois

After 8 months of trial and error, hundreds of hours spent on YouTube videos. I have finally made my first $100. 

Lmfao r/stocks thinks we’re autistic and they take 8 months to make $100

Shall I buy calls or just shares? Late to the party...

What is propelling GameStop to these gains?
I’m still rooting for the guy who was down $40k on TSLA $1000c 1/15
I sold BB EoD

The answer is yes. Especially if certain bald clowns don’t stfu. We are now on high alert and restrictions may certainly be applied.

Having run that maths through my abacus - WSB would have more stonk buying power than the entire 1.9T helicopter money programme lol
I was a 🌈🐻 last night when I didn’t buy more AH at 31$. Bought more today though and plan on buying more tomorrow. GME GANG 💎👐🚀🚀🚀
Holy shit, this is FANTASTIC DD. I never even considered the amount of float that is owned by institutions that'll hold regardless of price action. Thank you for linking! I totally missed this post. 

The infinite DTC is truly incredible. Shorts will absolutely go insolvent on this horrible play they've made.
i could only wish
@ but are we talking about selling at 50 (lol no) or 100 (yes?)
Sell my -75% 1-22 NIO call in the morning or hold til worthless ?
What yolo I do at open (I swear to god don’t say GameStop)
what's the tax on that?
very important indeed
Made an extensive DD about this in my last post. This sub removed it. It’s now on r/robinhoodpennystocks
Right now if we take a look at the S&P 500 the % are something like -

AAPL - 6.42%
MSFT - 5.07%
...etc.

So my question is, if I invest $100 in the SPY, is it equivalent to investing $6.42 in AAPL, $5.07 in MSFT, and so on
Bed and bath actually a strong buy for tomorrow?

I bought 750 shares this morning. BB is extremely under valued. Tomorrow is going to be crazy
We all know that SEC is full of pussies who don’t do shit
I’ve never used their paid services so I can’t speak to that but I like their premarket show on YouTube. They’ve been part of my premarket routine now for over a year and it’s been helpful to me.
For reals. I'm tired of having to walk people through options except for a few close friends.

If I see anyone asking if their FD's are going to print while at the same time asking what an FD is, I'm going to tell them it's a Free Delivery of money.

Fuck em. I am not a financial advisor so you aren't going to get financial advice.
$30C 21Jan-2022 too optimistic?
2 @ 17$. I almost bought the .02cent calls that morning. But overall Portfolio up 41% since dec 24.
I still have $40 and $50 (got rid of all my $25 and $30 that i had before this week and i  had averaged the fuck down quickly on Wed morning when they were like .20 cents and made $$$). If the rest of my calls are underwater tomorrow morning depending on what is going on with GME premarket I am going to average down again at some point, (if i see volume coming in).
No idiot
IWM to $150 tomorrow

it gapped up then sold down hard $30 ...thankfully it met solid resistance there
It 100% isn't normal. Challenge now is to keep your ego in check. We now have thousands of stock gurus that have been trading for 6 months and have a sub $5k account, yet they want to go on YouTube and reddit and preach about how smart they are and how they can't lose money. Happens every bull market over all asset classes. We are not smart, we are not special, everything is going up and everything is hyped. A legit moron can make a killing in this market, and they are. Myself included of course.

Strong fundamentals or some boring shit along the lines of that. The point is, we’re WSB and the rocket is fueling so get your ticket and enjoy the ride!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Especially with high unemployment.  That'll wreck a bunch of small businesses which are struggling right now.
Oh it is, just probably not as fast as the idiots are calling it.  Long term absolutely.  AMZN is a true buy and hold IMO.

danke schön. so you plan to hold through ER... I hesitate with my 140C; last quarter's -6% was brutal.
Yup. Been riding the TLRY and APHA wave the past few days
This is fucking data

Nah because it will become impossible to identify actual plays in all the comment spam, and the only people who are going to be motivated enough to write long DD's are the con artists shilling all the retards a pump and dump
GME
Time to say Ali Byebye
I’ve been reading into this to try and find an answer and I think I’ve figured it out. The US treasury, which is basically the governments own savings of USD, is adding 2 trillion more into circulation. Because there is now 2 trillion less in money reserves for loans etc, the interest rates increase to encourage more people to hold money in the US treasury. The reason for the spike today must have been people taking this opportunity. In particular this would have affected AUD too as the interest return from USD became more favourable, so a lot of long term ‘safe’ investors took their money out of gold and put it into USD. Because gold makes up a large part of AUD’s exports, this would have caused AUD to go down.
That was last night's news. It's why SPCE  mooned today.

Frankly I am just grateful that for once they put common decency above profits. I’m sure they were aware this would happen but took a moral stand regardless.

And man I hate twitter and Facebook,I only use either when related to my work, they are usually the scum of the earth, so I mean it when I say it

Yeah people do it all the time. There are entire companies that do this e.g. Citron.
I mean the GME short squeeze. Like it’s actually happening, almost like a WSB wet dream.
Only lose when you cell
Sec regulations 😂
thanks. guess ill get some 2022 leaps on top of my existig calls
Lets all face it. Do you really want to risk not being balls deep in PLTR if/when it moons? I cant tolerate that level of potential fomo I am a weak man and therefore am doubling down on my positions 🚀🚀🚀
Where do you see that?
So I've set budgets for ten years for schools districts - if they get a little extra it all gets eaten up and or hidden in our reserves for the day when budgets are cut again. 

Or when people stop paying their property taxes like 6% of people did this year. 

Look make a meme and people will bid the stocks but it won't translate into any meaningful new business. 

In the last round of stimulus in 08-09 for schools we got $2.4 mil. We bought 18 wifi hotspots that were outdated 15 mths later.
Lol why, it’s prolly hitting 220 tomorrow
How do you guys go about taking breaks?

I'm up 250% From last years initial investment so I thought I'de just take some time off and hold some shares and just chill out and not watch the market for 2 weeks or so. But now I'm fomo as fk on missing out on GME Rockets, but not even GME, the ZM Bounce, the Etsy Pump. All these missed opportunities guys wtf. Do I just not take a break and go on forever? lol
WHERE IS MY BB GANG AT?!?! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
i yolo'd the entire port this morning on top of my 1/22 calls. LFG
Dunk on that hoe
Love you too, pumpkin
Tru March are the next earnings, what about the Fed today saying interest rates will stay low? 

I agree it's performance as of late hasn't been inspiring. I see it as one of my safer stocks. They are the market leader in mortgages (they own quicken) and i bought it at 19, feel like its a good value.
that’s the only way to know you’re alive, Alice. now crawl down the hole and meet me on the other side.
People think everything is a squeeze after GME, going to take a while until the youngbloods of the market realize what a rare opportunity GME was

Good for them
Eyyyy that's what I like to hear
Thank you♥️
Also, let’s start organizing a WSB exodus
why did I sell 900 shares of BBBY at 19. 5 days later it’s at 29 that’s 9grand of unrealized profit
Hmm sounds like they go hand in hand. I think stripe should acquire plaid now that visas out tbh
Stonks only go up!

AAPL is the best place to be right now if you want safety and resiliency with long term growth. They are going to have a massive quarter, rumors point to increased orders with their manufacturing partners. They have hundreds of billions in the bank and are buying back shares and have incredible resiliency during COVID. AR/VR in the next year or two, Apple Car around 2025-2028, I feel AAPL is a company you want to hold long term. I‘ve been long shares for years and I like shares vs calls to collect a dividend and have a DRIP. I’ll also sell some puts like the Feb 19 120P to collect some extra income Theta Gang style at a price I’m happy to buy at or wheel from there. You can make some cash with your AAPL 2/19 $130.00 call if it pops after earnings, if you are open to a longer term hold consider long OTM calls in further out months like April or June so there is less Theta decay working against you.
Minimum

More tendies for GME and PLTR
Black Berry just sold 90% of their technology to Huawei. Friend of mine that heads up the engineering department just confirmed it and is most likely losing his job.

Besides potentially realizing it as income instead of LTCG, it's not like you don't profit hugely if you get exercised at 13 tomorrow.
Let's say he received those million shares at $5 each. Now if the CEO had bought 5,000,000 in gme options, they would be worth 33,000,000,000
Anyone else in $MARA? I know the c o i n s aren't allowed to be discussed here, but what about stonks related to them? There's a pretty consistent floor to the stock imo and 19-21 debit spreads are looking pretty good
I too foresee Amazon adding a trillion dollars to its market cap by EOM.
Yes, trading starts, but at 9am the morning bell rings. The app turns white, 9:31 option movements post
Sorry I just assumed you were talking about GME
“The fact that it’s so richly valued and still has money to pay a dividend tells me that they have a ton of profits”

I don’t follow your logic at all. Their phuckton of profits is represented by their PE of 88. They have yield of 0.12%. Their dividend hasn’t grown since 2018. And I don’t get how you equate their rich valuation with their level of profits. I just don’t follow. 

We can all agree to disagree here. NVidia has done tremendously and their investors have been richly rewarded. But I don’t their pop onto many dividend investors radar, nor should they, necessarily. 

Yes, investing in growth stocks to generate capital to invest in dividend payers is a good strategy (IMO), but when it’s time to turn on the dividend spigot, NVidia isn’t going to be a name many people turn to. 

Yes, investors have done amazing with it
Fucked up making fun of this dude but I’m on the same ride baby let’s have a safe trip
Your break even is just the strike price + premium price. I could be wrong but I think it's something to do with the risk/reward relationship of strike.

It is not high if we get another 100% squeeze
If part time becomes less stigmatized, dropping from 32 hours to 24 hours per week would be “fun” in the sense that it’s still enough to cover expenses and it comes with 4-day weekends which is enough to support any hobby I might want to pursue. 

Else starting a microgrowery in a legal state is my current post-FIRE frontrunner. Learning a new industry and skills, finding clients, and making a little cash on the side sounds fun.
I've been doing this the entire run up
good to hear, 𝚃𝚑𝚊𝚗𝚔 you my friend. am also feeling hopeful
Makes perfect sense then the IOU is at the bottomed price when they buy more to fulfil the IOU... how does that happen if it’s all done digitally.

I mean I’d imagine people selling shares would be looking at a computer with the amount of shares available to sell and the price, like we do? Does that mean it’s clearly done on purpose. 

Surely this could go tits up if they made the mistake of selling after some major announcement they were not aware of.

Thx for info
Why yes, yes I do.
And why do you recommend buying calls closest to expiration?
Gonna liquidate my account and go all in on a weekly please I need a good play
were famous. boomers are mad
Oh it is for sure happening. Especially if this GME really does keep going. Big money isn't going to take the L lightly.
What’s the percentage of shorts?
 If this goes up 50%, the likelihood of an infinity gamma squeeze from the 55c 1/15’s is like 100%. Push the afterburner switch bros 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Mars is occupated, but we’re flying this to the moon 🚀🚀
I bought 15 11.5 C 1/22 but it was after hours should I cancel or will it be fine tomorrow??
How bro, just not gonna happen
regulating what? Its a public forum, its no different than shitron releasing a hit piece on a stock they are starting to short.
Damn, Graham and Kevin used to be so good when they were talking solely about real estate. 

They got me into it and I own two properties that are going to be the home to a duplex and a cabin in the next year. Thing is I started watching those dudes loooong before they blew up. Now all the vids I liked most are behind the course paywalls. 

Just talk with an actual real estate investor. They'll give you great advice. You don't get rich quickly with real estate unless you started buying the bottom of the market in 2013 in California, Chicago, or NYC lol
F
Lets do it. Ive been waiting
Yeah lol. I joined around may I think
They should just make a newcomer post explaining terminology and how to lose their life savings in one option
Is it just me or does TSLAs 1m and 3m chart look bull is as fuck?
It took me a while to know what FD stood for. I knew what it meant, just didnt know what it stood for🤣
In all seriousness, I think GME will move past $50 tomorrow.
Finally
watchout they close them for you 1 hr b4 close sometimes =\\
I am
Puts on fat chicks unless you in a slump then go all innnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

I think tech will continue to rise but sectors like green energy which are propped up by govt spending get free money and will do well as a result
Holding my 100 shares.
U think this is high?
Its a negative for sure. Normies and boomers  incoming. Pack it up boys. Its been a great ride.
Anything less than a weekly is an FD
Good. LMND is so overvalued
ALL IN IN KEYWORDS STUDIOS, GOING TO THE MOON🚀🚀🧑‍🚀
Uhhhhhhh you hold and then you buy more calls because we’re just getting started 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
LMT. Especially when considering their AJRD acquisition. Super optimistic :)

GME will likely be 80+ after lunch. This thing is gonna be crazy. You think you've seen a squeeze? This shit is just getting started.
Gme
You’re a god
Damn this looks good
Well shit, due to my lack of impulse control I bought 600 shares at 2.00. How fucked am I?

"Degrees", there's your problem.  Have fun staying riddled in $300k+ debt at 4-6% interest.  Government created the student loan dilemma anyhow and people like you bought into the propaganda.
I unironically think Kanye is autistic.

He isn't swaying in time to the beat. He's clearly a little uncomfortable, probably because of the camera. He's having fun, but also can't decide whether to smile.

I meant at open today as in Thursday. I did this and didn’t break even until the after noon or something lol. But if you buy and hold shares they can be used for shorts which means the shorters have to keep buying shares to cover their positions. Driving the price up. Way up.
They just gained $300 million today.  They can last out a few more months.  Realistically you only have until now people support ending lockdowns than enforcing them. Thats going to be within the next 2 months.
Huh, it was up over 13% today. Sooo what is the impact of this?
I guess it is trading with Tesla, and Tesla is getting dragged down by FANG.
Its free damoney

Single source of truth. It doesn’t make sense for the banks to take that role. Plus plaid has already grabbed a majority of market share

what i dont get is.. if you just went long literally anything you'd made like 30%+ just with ETFs... or if you yolo'd into tech up like 200-500%
Imagine taking 8 months, during THESE past 8 months, when every single stock has gone up $100
Most of the times, EVERY TIME I jump on a rocket ship it crash a few hours later. PLUG 71$ was the latest offender.

Its the attitude of this sub specifically. Too many weak links here who's words will end up in an investigation into market manipulation.

PLTR is on the same path GME was. Wait for this to pop and we’ll all be driving our other porsches
your only regret is not being MORE retarded
If the market has taught me one thing, get enough delusional idiots together, and they can make their delusions a reality. GME 🚀🌕
If you're looking at ETF's I personally recommend ICLN. It's a clean energy ETF which I believe will outperform TAN (also a clean energy ETF) over the next few months. A Democrat government will likely raise clean energy prices, so in my relatively inexperienced opinion, ICLN is the way to go.
Dang NKLA, that's quite the bounce if I say so myself.
Lmao at the first comment. "How much money you plan on losing this time"
So you’re warning people to be careful because the same thing might happen tomorrow as what happened today, about the stock that went up 25% today?
What’s the deal with BB? New meme stock? Thinking about getting into some Leaps
Buying puts on Tan tomorrow. RSI is over 90 on the fucking MONTHLY chart, everyone expecting this biden announcement to send clean energy to the moon and don't realize these stocks already at Mars and need to consolidate. Also shorting tesla tomorrow.
He jelqed himself right outta here
NEVER SELL, Stonks only go up!
Thank you!
26% of float
I'm not sure you know what premise means.  

Also you derive a companies value by taking the number of shares and dividing it by the revenue of the previous year. Game stop trades far under its revenue, which means if you did the math you'd get 90 per share. That's not even counting the squeeze.
Really appreciate you taking the time to write that out. 

Seeing if I actually understand this-

If you sell the call to me for $300 and then the price stays flat and premiums drop down (iv crush) then you can buy back the option at $100 , make your profit and not worry about it being exercised? Kinda using the crush to your advantage?
yeah im probably in for POSH..

How do you know?
Which index funds?
Well us eurofags would love to fuck with you cowboys but we are stuck on shitty brokers that have like 1/10th of the tickers you call. Been reading this community for some times and can’t follow most of the calls. Fucking etoro and shit.

i just signed up for Reddit.  i have been investing since 2017. i watch Jim Cramer daily as well as follow CNBC all day long.  follow Zacks and Motley Fool.

Cramer said something interesting today about reddit people hitting the short squeeze people by bidding up stocks...you hear anything?

regarding what you wrote above. yes EV  Infrastructure, Alt. energy, Agriculture, Cyber security, Fin Tech, Crypto (not directly buying or trading)...SQ, Paypal, maybe the upcoming Coinbase (not public yet0
Based on...
Lmaoo, this is what like to hear. I feel like the rest of the autists finally
Educate me. What's your exit strategy for this call assuming TLRY keeps going up?
Alright in for a little.
Maybe he just works at a pension fund and can fuck around with this kind of thing
Praying my TSLA FD call doesn’t die tomorrow
this is my only worry
Ok but why you gotta come for me like that.... 😭
First of all: BAN

second, we aren’t pumping just anything. We believe in the fundamentals of GME and that with Cohen on board GME and the expertise of his team GME will become a strong and disruptive player

I think military cut won’t happen. US is not in a position to cut military budget since China and Russia remain a bigger threat and plus China’s economy is growing rapidly

At the HOD ofc you dumdum.
Play GME if your fast af
Doesn’t matter since they will merge.
can we get a 1% pump on ICLN AH?
Yea for sure
I have some 3/19 and 6/18 calls.
because of all the selling
Well I'm day trading so I am going to possibly sell it minutes later if it goes against me.  Closer expiration are more liquid and less risk premium u have to pay. It also moves more with the stock.
I was hoping today was gonna be flat to get some more. Gamestop shares are like mint first edition Charizards and everyone wants them.
Just waiting for my ICLN, ENPH, QCLN, RUN, and VALE calls to print
Will we know before market close though? Will definitely make holding through the long weekend an easier decision
Yes
Well done! Retired at 57....congrats. Better than 90% of our population.  This is a made up stat...Ha! FIRE wasn’t always a thing.  Most people just called early retirement or retirement.  Total we have so many ‘micro’ social identities it’s ridiculous.
Who is this retard?
My gawd seeing this gets me pumped! Buying more tomorrow morning. 💎🤚🏿🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I think you're generalizing when that is an edge case. I certainly don't have 300k in debt lol.
Inflation to the Moon! To the MOOOOON!
No problem mate, obviously all penny stocks have risk, but I always like to buy into ones where I can see the company technically doing well into the future!
I sold GME and APHA and TLRY and WISH and I just did the dumbest thing ever. I bought RKT because every stock with high short interest is mooning time for RKT.

I just want to take a moment and reflect on the fact that this GME play will go down in WSB history. 

I think this is the first time that a market maker has been caught with their pants so far down, only to have **retail traders** to descend on them like a pack of wild dogs.

I wonder if that one guy was about it and drank his own piss
Transocean is up 356% since october. 

Schlumberger is a major service company, its not up that high but has had a nice recovery and dividends.

Gonna try not to be political but alas oil is politics.

Everybody says oh Biden is pro electric blah blah blah.

How much money was his boy making as a consultant to a Ukrainian oil company? Just to provide a "contact".

Not to mention we had a conflict with russia when they moved on the region but i am sure its coincident. 

If hillary won, the thought was that we would be in another war, now her comrade is back in office.

Biden will probably go back to pro china globalist economic policies, which will help drive thier economy which is becoming a major importer of oil. 

Obama is the guy who made it legal for the U.S. to export oil to other nations.

Covid wont last forever.

I dont care how you feel about these people or thier promises, all politicians are after money and power.

Oil is still tied to the american dollar.

The fed is printing money for economic stimulis.

If the dollar inflates the the price of oil goes up.

Also, when the economy is down it seems that oil goes up. I dont know why.

I am super duper bullish on oil.

Transocean, schlumberger, diamondback energy, apache, murphy, mi swaco, Halliburton. Etc.

I am gonna try to figure out who makes valves and maybe invest in them. 

I may be wrong and the run up that we have seen is it but i think there is more room to grow, especially if the powers that be are heavily invested in it. 

For example, diamondback energy was once valued at 120 a share at the peak crazy oil field and its in the 50s right now.

You mean it dipped after the new year 5% a day for a few days? Did it recover slightly and then plunge again? I'm definitely on my toes right now and have some extra cash in hand in case I ought to buy the dip but then again, it may only be the beginning. Idk I guess I'm just riding the train till I get spooked and hopefully it's not too late by then.
So I’ve decided I’m going to go all in on BB tomorrow.

yes, it will probably sell off down to 35 in the first 30 mins of trading. the point is, to hold the line or buy more at that point
I still don’t have them. Do you have to have gold or something?
I have some rental property. I treat my tenants as I would want to be treated and have had really smooth relationships thus far. Management companies cut into bottom line, use their shoddy labor, and generally do not add value.

No, everyone knows the higher the share price means it's overvalued. AMZN is one of the most overvalued companies on the market! They're barely profitable and a $3.1k share price! Don't even get me started on BRK.A! The best stocks are the ones closest to $0.01. /s

People are downvoting you because they don't like what you have to say, but you are at least partially right. Laziness might not be the only or biggest reason, but it is a reason I have seen a lot with my own eyes. 

There are dudes I know collecting unemployment, disability, and stimulus checks and then spending it on OnlyFans ho's or trying to buy attention from women with it. Why the hell should my tax dollars go to some simp's masturbation aids? Fuck those guys. We're going to end up with an economy where handouts are given to simps, who then give it to sex workers, both of whose numbers grow because people see it as easy money, and then a continually shrinking population of people who have to work harder but get taxed more to fund that shit. THAT is /r/aboringdystopia.

You could buy and hold now while the price is low, but i dont expect any big moves in the near term.  Just my opinion.
Fuck man I thought you were all systematically hunted and destroyed
I’m not sure about popping anymore. Too many s&p matchers moved in. So no more big volatility. No more big losses or gains. At least that’s my thought.
They have no right to shut us down, we've done nothing. Stocktwits does the same thing all the time and there's no problem, so why would we be in trouble? Ah yes, our ideas work and we are organized, threatening the big bois' control over the public. That's a pretty good reason to shut us down indeed.
His predictions yesterday include 45 GME today, 60 EOW, and then "Shit. I think I'm getting hard for GME puts."

He bases his projection on his sell limits.

Alright well this is getting kinda weird. You are either deepfucknvalue or some creepy fan boy of him. The latter is significantly worst imo. Anyways. I'm off to go spend my last hundred dollars on a few gme stonks. You guys enjoy jerking off your hero and have a good evening

Kudos brotha
you might just be an autistic genius 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Sad that the D&D folks are no longer a fixture.. or the card game kids.
Easy money brother
Got the second dose yesterday and no autism yet so don't get your hopes up!
What’s your predictions for the following EOD tomorrow? 

TSLA
SPY
GME

🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐💎💎💎💎💎💎
How to do that?
How do you buy calls? I wanna but some BB but don't know shit bout calls!
^^^ buy the dip in fcel and plug
Yeah, I didn't like them at first, but they grew on me.  I think the noise issue is more so because the car has no engine noise.  They seem to handle well.  I love the acceleration of the performance model 3, but they chew up tires pretty fast.  I had couple of 3 series, acura, lexus, and by far the model 3 has been my favorite.  I do love the bmw m3 and m4s.
Selling my tesla calls at open.
Yo you got a source for that? I went to my doctor two years ago about that because id go soft with my gf. Doc told me i was just too stressed and my levels were fine but tbh i doubt that was true and he wouldnt tell me my fucking level.
Gotta buy shares to unlock answer.
Yeah I’m interested to find out as well. I have some Fitbit too.
Bro im greedy as fk. I Can't stop looking at the numbers. I don't eat those Wendies Donuts they for poor people.
Cause stocks go up!
That one uranium company stock was rising and they released a statement that there was no good reason for it to be going up......
You need both imo.

What else you got? Surely not just those 2
The crime is you're not losing your money to Melvin, duh.

Oh. My. Fuking. God.

Signet jewelry and Honeywell CEO interviews make me hope I get covid and black out in the next 30secs
GME
With the fuel Cathie added...$SPCE is in a pretty good spot for a squeeze.  Especially if they come out with a test flight date soon.
thats lame
So it's going to go up?
I had a similar experience with MARA I got in at $5 in august and it tanked until November hover in the $2-$4 range. Once is peaked over $5 again I set a stop loss which open low due to BTC and sold majority of my shares. Every time I see the price now I cringe a little but honestly okay with it cause I just remember being down 50% while the rest of the market sky rocketed
“No honey he said Wall Street BITS! Bits like the computer thing!”

AMD and Apple are dying along with my hopes and dreams
the short squeeze hasn't even begun. these are just long accumulations. a squeeze would send the stock over 100
Alright, go get the lube.

Can’t believe it closed at 42, this is wild.
My bad, I meant let’s short squeeze it! Fuck Citi bank.
I love you bro. Thanks for keeping me off the streets
I have zero DD. I saw that chart go up 20% today. That tells me it will run again tomorrow. I am in a short term play so I can't comment on mid-March.

I found a weird way to make tendies. I continuously bet on -1000 sports games. Gains are small, but the 10% compounding is adding up.
Rough numbers are $680M EBITDA on $840M Revenue (thats CAD) on LTM, so that should be pretty much all be GEO. Granted there will be some decline here as folks transition to LEO but they still have a lot of runway on existing GEO hardware
GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
This is the explanation I was looking for. Thank you for the education.
This is the way.
Bull run is over
for u newbies...don't look anyone in the eye, keep you head down, buy what we tell u and you'll be fine
Careful rsi 


Is not reliable

Your wasting money not doing it now friend
Is 28 considered young?
better do it right now its almost up 15% after market
biden will probably pump clean energy in his inauguration speech next week
too late for GME

no worries, I got MSTR.......
0 DTE options on RH now too. Go to your setting and enable it. Go forth and retard YOLO GME tomorrow
When I take profits early, I think of the saying "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush".

But then I also think of the even more wise saying "Scared money don't make no money!"
Open or after hours / premarket? I don’t want this to run up in the premarket
I see. Yes, single source api to deal with is a big plus for app developers anyway. Thanks for the answer!
Any advice on when to buy in, what time are they supposed to announce all of this. Or is it already official.
https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-price-turns-higher-again-after-record-china-imports/ thank you vale
The wheel. Keep enough to average down if put sell goes against you. Diversify into enough companies so you're never bagholding your entire portfolio unless market completely crashes. Wait for the right opportunities to sell options, positions don't always have to be open. Be wary with meme stocks, only small positions. Keep up with research for new stocks. Don't begrudge when a call gets assigned you still made money.
MJ anyone?
thank you!
You should be making a few $ tomorrow.
I scrolled and saw Matchbox 20 and I immediately left the thread
daddy pls buy me
Long term this stock is going to rocket, and rocket organically. This has been held down for years, and in those years BlackBerry has successfully restructured itself to be a leader in the sector they're aiming for. They have a superior product in my opinion to their competitors (endpoint security, ev software (in the works), IoT) and this is going to be a catalyst for their hyper growth. I personally think this is easily a $20 stock this year, but that could go higher or maybe a tad lower, but it is severely underpriced for what they have. Their market cap should be at least 3x what it is now imo.
Going down, their latest offering closes tmr. I got puts at the peak today and will exit after shares dump tmr.
Im buying bb tomorrow but definitely not selling my lucid shares. I think theyll take off
Got a bunch of $10 calls for tomorrow... y’all think they will fill at the closing prices tomo morning?
Yeah u can't trade options in after hours, also the price won't adjust till market opens either. It's likely that call is triple the price now
True but the physical market is STILL shrinking overall, hence their revenues will never grow to what they once were unless they significantly expand their digital and online capabilities. Bricks and mortar can be a strength, but the fact that so many locations are unprofitable proves it's unlikely to be a major source of growth in the future either.
Shorts still haven’t covered. Squeeze will continue into next week
Gme
Can you show me data that says the short is propping it up?
Sell at open.
Just read through the stimulus proposal and wow - if Biden can get through a quarter of that stuff it will be monumental. Seems like healthcare, retail spending, and IT/tech might be the big movers based on what I'm reading.
I understand. But on the other hand I am thinking IF the financial system would crash down, money is worth shit. We will have other worries at that point. So the government won’t let the thing crash down. And if you do fear that scenario, then why invest ? Money will end up being worth nothing so... 

But I agree, rates must come up at some point. I think hyperinflation will be the “solution”, but will hammer the weak and poor, and the gap will become larger. But yea this is just some reasoning that can change every day right 😉
I’ve read tomorrow
My uppands will never come! No comeuppance!

That’s all we know 🤷🏼‍♂️
Sorry, I should clarify. I mean more in line with investor or retail sentiment between the two companies. Like say if a SPAC were to take either one public. Which would be more popular / well known amongst the millennial or younger demographic.
thank you!

WHO THE FUCK IS ICEBERG RESEARCH?????
It's your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights!

G.M.E. continued its retard-strength short squeeze today and will likely trade between 40 and 10,000 tomorrow, while SPY and AAPL continued to eat shit and fuck me

Chimpu out
Nah, we're walter white and he's Declan. OUR GAINS CANNOT BE IGNORED.
I mean the video didn't really show much- just said they will continue to focus on censorship and use the Q Anon model (that they apparently have used to censor Q Anon accounts) in the future.  Nothing that we don't already no, and probably wasn't worth some person at Twitter risking their job to record.

I'd be more worried about the new user volumes on some of the alternative social sites like Signal.  That's more a sign people are leaving the platform and revenue opportunities shrink.  No one with a majority in our government cares about Twitter censoring some conservative accounts- it serves the current admin's purpose.
Me too. My first option was a way OTM Spy put that printed. Hooked right away.
This is the way.

Pay attention to the Greeks though.  Read up on those.
All of this attention WSB has been getting from the media can't be good for us.  I don't know how or why, but it's giving me an ugly feeling in my stomach.
He didn't show us all the other $10k "loans" he flushed down the drain on FDs
So hot sale on BABA and NIO the coming days?
Like a fucking bandit in the night, beating 🌈 🐻’a into submission
Yea it’s super cool, manganeseeee wooo i love that atom stuff, should buy morr

Lmao this is incredible. When can we start putting out WSB Price Targets?

Hah yes
I bought in at the dip in August (when i first started investing) and fuck am i glad i did. Though with hind sight i should have just put everything onto tesla, I'm not enough of an ****** to confidentiality go all in on one stock.
Good evening Sir, my name is Steve. I come from a rough area. I used to be addicted to crack but now I am off it and trying to stay clean. That is why I am selling magazine subscriptions.
I can’t. Gotta close my tesla leaps, turn on margin and hope for the best. Thinking March 19 10Cs and shares
I was happy to hear a lot of states are opening vaccination to anyone 65+, no restrictions starting in the next couple of days.  Ought to help get those lines going.
They sure didn't.
Realistically speaking, what price can gme see EOM? I saw somewhere that they hired a new team?(correct me if I’m wrong)
Fuck, was heavily debating getting into BB at open.
Seems like just a few months ago, but yeah, when did proof-or-ban stop being a thing?

I'll take it.
I feel like GOEV  and CLNE are the best ones to gain from this.
How I feel about FCEL.
As a complete fucking joke earlier, I bought a bunch of 1/15 10c's of BB for .08 today at about 10:30 MST.    


It jumped up 300% in like 5 fucking minutes.  So I went digging.  The September 15c, given BB's trajectory and a little DD (coupled with my knowledge of how far out a company hitching its wagon to the automotive market takes to realize gains), was the absolute sweet spot.    


Granted, that was when the stock was at 8.50.  It looks like it's at like 11 AH right now, so it will shift tomorrow, but that's still going to be a rock solid exit date.
What were premiums on those?? Couldn’t have been much over 10 cents lol. Enjoy the tendies
Also bought 3 GME shares today for the fuck of it. Already up 10 bucks. GAINS ARE GAINS
Rumor is he’s broadcasting live from a GameStop store

That’s some solid DD right there

Happy?
Putting respect on our name 😅👍🥳
I wont have buying power till tommorrow but if it opens sub 10 ill a few good leaps.  Otherwise im gonna be buying a couple hundred shares and holding till 40$ a share.
I can’t imagine. Hopefully GME will go parabolic and make up for this
You can sell the call that you purchased or you can exercise it. It’s easier to just sell them as a noob. Exercising means you buy 100 stocks at that strike price.
I don’t have calls anymore but I see a lot of PLTR in this doc
Fuck I’m dumb
1/22 better 🚀 🚀 🚀
Who the hell said anything about shutting us down?
I bought 166 more shares today. It’s a hold.
Bought 100 today. Ready for it.
yeah im kinda restarted sorry
I’ve been spreading this post as much as possible. A lot of people don’t comprehend what we have here. This is history.
oh oh  guys we're in trouble. Cramer is really pissed at us. And instead of just saying Reddit he finally said Wall Street Bets. He said we're causing the short squeeze. Like what about the assholes shorting the stock? Shorting more shares than exist? No it's us the buyers were causing the short squeeze. 

We're manipulating the market. What planet does this MFer live on?

He also said we're causing the short squeeze on bed bath & beyond. I think we're going to have to go see the principal tomorrow you guys.
Better make your money now ha
Glad you liked it! I am probably not going to make any more posts on this, unless we make any significant changes to the sheet, such as new data/features or somehow a more simplistic display, but to me and my friend, as “numbers and data lovers”, this sheet is just fine with nothing spared. If you have any suggestions we would love to hear them.

And for the record, just bookmark/save our sheet, and you can continuously use it. I try to update it almost daily with the new trades coming in from the ARK fund/Cathie Woods. :)
I’m not stopping until I buy my mom a house or myself a new truck, still can’t decide
So do you come to the reddit / check the stocks daily when you take some time off? Or do you just go the route of don't look, don't think about it? I'm probably screwing myself over because I'm still checking the market once a day and checking the reddit cause it's pretty funny here lol.
I want to see a Lambo. Someone asked him about it on his stream last night.
Did you buy in?
Isn’t citron the same guy that shorted PLTR when it actually mooned from 13 to 30. And instead of seeing rocket emojis in this post I’m seeing clown emojis. I’m out sir.
It needs a rkt 🚀
Sold GIKcall too early and missed out on a bunch of profit, is it still a good time to get in before merger? If so what position since 15c 1-15 is already itm now
Might as well!!

What's the logic behind the play? Or is there any?
Me.  For the last two months.   Gotta get used to the volatility .... but i take the profits and go back in.   Its a pretty easy pattern and just match it up with coynes value
You ever read that story about the guy that lost 27k doing that? The other team pulled from behind. lol

Not quite 10x, but almost 9x by PDD from the middle of 2019 to now. Market cap went from 25B to 215B.
I guess that makes sense since the pdt restrictions.
$112 ... When? WHEN?
With how much the market is up from summer of last year it's almost impossible not to have picked a few good stocks and been up.

That shit will be harder in a regular year

Loaded to tits on $55 calls. Bought, bought, averaged down, bought more, averaged up. ;)

 Let's goooooooooo!!!!

I'm tired of buying the dip and still losing on PLTR.  I'm gonna buy calls one more time to play into demo day.  If that doesn't work, I'll never trade PLTR options again.  Too many other opportunities.
your a king keep holding the line we dont sell till 420.69 $$$$

No fucking balls.
You're forgetting about the lockup expiry. It will be in the teens for a while.
Care to elaborate on apple?
Got some GME calls that expire tomorrow. Those are printing rn in AH. Don't have enough funds in RH atm :((( need to transfer in more
In at .19 gonna hold for a few months at lest
I’ve started studying BTMM and it offers a different perspective, but what do you recommend of any?
My Jan 2022 leaps have more than a year to go. A dollar a day is all I need.
Thanks that’s a cool site. I bought for $75 and sold for $510 during a midday spike today. Rollled that into BB shares and up 15%.....
Should I go to the gym, or listen to Biden’s speech and take a nap?

We'll see tomorrow then.
You know what, if ICLN moons, I'll drink my own piss
One correction, they did replace the guy who left, it's just that his responsibilities are split between me and the new guy. But yeah there's only so much you can do within the context of large corporations so I'll take the short term gain. My boss said the standard "promotion" raise is 6%. Internal moves come with a lot of limitations. 

I've been with the company my entire career (13.5 years). I'm not opposed to leaving if I find something significantly better but I do enjoy my current work, make a good salary (will be around $150k this year in a LCOL area), enjoy the people, have a lot of autonomy, and currently am WFH which I hope can continue after Covid.

It's all a balance.
I hope for a dip but it's retarted when it's gonna be over 69 within months

Ok real talk. The stock has increased exponentially at this point. Should I wait for a dip to buy back in or buy in now as there is a potential for continued surge? I’m speculating that the stock will settle next week and would be a better time for me to buy back in.
Cry about how I’m out of capital from being balls deep in GME and can’t fomo into BB.

This is great but it just sounds like mods will pick and choose what is classed a pumper... so basically speaking freely as it says in your group info actually means mods get to pick and choose.

Hmmm, good DD.  It will probably go up, but I’m not a fan of Matchbox Twenty and I don’t like the Soundstr description.  

Might be a dumb question, but are they expecting a restaurant or club to pay a fee every time an artist’s song comes on? I always thought it would be a better idea to have a tv screen that shows what song is on. In this way, the artist gets promoted and patrons/customers can go download or stream their songs.

The cheaper one. Generally speaking if something goes wrong you lose less and if something goes right you make more.
Well done, soldier!
How much Lucid do you have?
As a GME seller a 15$ can someone tell WTF HAPPENED. 

HOW IS IT AT 42$!!!
why not both?
Mostly I just look at the 30 day charts. If it is moving upwards and has increasing volume I’m inclined to partake. I also check the number of float shares and try to avoid any stock that has more than a couple HUNDRED MILLION SHARES out there... 100 million outstanding shares is OK, 2  billion is NOT. 
Also, if I like a stock that I own but want to take a profit because it went UP, I’ll usually sell about half the shares and let the rest ride out.

Check out IIPR. It's kind of like a weed stock. But they make money from the weed companies
Im in at .17, only 500 shares tho. Not sure if i should sell and rebuy on a dip later on or just keep what i have
Big batch tomorrow, more in April and June/July if I recall.
Did deepvalue sell?
Could I trouble you some more? 

let's say the stock is $10, and you have $20 call.

* you buy 100 shares for $10 (-$1k) and sell for $20 (+$2k) you made $1k profit

* you buy a $20 call for $X (idk how much, but i assume not much, say -$100). Then you exercise the call to get 100 shares, you pay -$900 ( $10*100 - what you already paid, correct?) and sell for +$2k). It's the same $1k profit right?

But the benefit of using options is that you don't have to pay upfront, and if it doesn't work out, say stock drops -50% you're only out the initial price of $100 vs $500? 


Sorry if this is very basic noob knowledge
Oh no! We'll just have to start another WSB2 like blackmarket2 and that will keep the fucking plebs out with their bullshit 800$ loss. Shit is annoying as fuck. I'm trying to get rich not read posts about someone crying about pennies. I have to skip past 10 posts til I get to some meat.
Cramer?
De can't wait for deepfuckingvalue update if it reaches 569usd. Dude would be up 40 millions, from 100k. Shit like this is why I can't sleep at night.
Also because of yield curve steepening and stimulus deferring consumer defaults and easing consumer finance pains.

Yeah.  I assume there's typically more supply than demand.  And they don't even offer a lot of them.  Have a bunch available right now is rather unusual.

FB actually dropped from it's IPO price of $38 down to around $17 in the first 4 months of trading, but then started going up and never looked back.  I was a fool to not get my 1,000 shares at $17.
Okay how to fuck do I keep missing out on the meme gains. I only ever seen to hear about the good shit after it 🚀🚀🚀 halfway to the moon. Last night you fuckers told me SPCE and I had a decent day at 8% but I missed the money train yet again with BB. Maybe I’m just too retarded for this shit. Fuck it, what’s the move tomorrow boys
Just less MCD growth, which is a boomer stock anyway so who cares.

This is a true statement and should be taken as a word of caution, but the mods do a great job of catching things that people should know better than to post. Most people here are not trying to purposefully manipulate anything. Besides, that tiger lady just pumped the shit out of some penny stock and nobody's knocking down her door.
I worked at a library part-time throughout high school and college (not a real librarian). 

Even for a small town, they could always find applicants with a degree in library science, but they had trouble finding people who were also comfortable with technology (you have to make decisions about cataloguing software, pick audiobook services to subscribe to, help patrons access the internet, that sort of thing). They also needed someone who was patient and friendly with the public regardless of age or ability...and not too uppity for manual work like shelving, making signs, or occasionally unclogging a toilet.

Just knowing a lot about books and reading book reviews doesn't cut it. That's the "fun part" that everyone wants to do lol.
More people need to be made aware of this. Going to be a lot of people shocked about taxes this year.
It's a bad omen. I'm out.
was there news saying we getting shut down? tf is this?
Here's how I'm playing this GME squeeze:

I've been slowly selling some of my 5k shares at peaks and replacing them with OTM options. This limits my downside risk but allows me to stay in the game if the stock keeps mooning. When those short term options go into the money, I sell them at a peak and buy further OTM options for next week to capture profits.

Contrary to popular opinion around here, the options are good for the squeeze because the MMs will have to buy shares and keep buying shares to delta balance as the price goes up.

Amazing, congrats!
It's taxed as a penalty every year until it's corrected. You can also correct it by under contributing in future years (but have to consider gains on the excess as well).
If you correct it by the file deadline there's no penalty or additional tax documentation. Having gone through the same thing last year, I'd suggest correcting it immediately. It can take a month or so to actually correct, so don't put it off too long.
We are in for a wild ride with GME. Strap in boys

since you're up 110%, then sell half so you keep your initial capital and at least gambling with house money if shit keeps going up to the moon.

Prior to a squeeze MTM losses alone aren’t likely to be the only factor if borrows are liquid and cheap. If it’s cheap to borrow then it’s more likely that the position will stay open until risk gets out of hand by which time it’s already a squeeze.
Do they have any upcoming catalysts?

If we actually grow the economy rampant inflation isn’t a given. But if all this money doesn’t support future growth then yes, it becomes toilet paper.
Think your nose might be broken
bad move bruh, leave it alone
This guy’s a clown. He thinks “googling what stocks are good” is good enough. And just because he made money doesn’t mean he could replicate the results. In fact...if that’s the process I’d be surprised if he didn’t lose money long term. He certainly won’t over-perform. 

The OP on the other hand is doing what everyone has to do. Work hard to improve and practice until they become proficient. He’s obviously made some mistakes early on but the fact is his performance isn’t even possible to judge because it hasn’t even been a year since he started.
What type of bargain bin house or absurdly expensive truck are you deciding between that they cost the same? I'd go with the house, if only because it can appreciate in value.

 From Buyden: The president-elect is also proposing $5 billion to cover home energy and water costs and arrears through programs like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, for struggling renters. These funds will ensure that the hardest-hit renters and small landlords, including those in disadvantaged communities that have suffered disproportionately in terms of pollution and other environmental harms, aren’t put in the position where they can’t cover their own housing expenses. This program includes a competitive set-aside of funding for states to invest in clean energy and energy efficiency projects that reduce electricity bills for families in disadvantaged communities..

Im a bit confused about how ETFs work. Hoping someone can clear this up for me:

Right now if we take a look at the [S&P 500 the %](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/constituents) are something like -

AAPL - 6.42%,
MSFT - 5.07%,
AMZN - 4.15%
...etc.

So my question is, if I invest $100 in the SPY, is it equivalent to investing $6.42 in AAPL, $5.07 in MSFT, $4.15 in AMZN, and so on
In this case it is more sophisticated - there is actual DD compared to TNXP - but far too many young accounts hyping not to raise a red flag.

Someone once told me I have to use my own judgement in order to develop good judgement. If you're being spoon-fed "safe" stocks how will you ever develop discernment? I'm not bitter about my losses at all - in fact I openly joke about them. You can't stop someone from learning a lesson, you're only prolonging the inevitable so you might as well take off the training wheels from the beginning at the risk of making them lazy. For example...

I spent half a day WHILE AT WORK looking up different brokerage apps yet you see people lazily walk in every day re-asking the same question without even bothering to search. Does my Google work better than everyone else or am I willing to at least try before I ask for help? There's a difference between "What's your experience with Program\_X?" and "Just tell me what to get.." Person A started looking but needed help with the final decision, and Person B just wants everyone to do the work for them.

Better example... "Where's a good place to discover stocks early?" vs "Which stocks do you think will take off next?" Person A wants to learn to work themselves and Person B wants to be spoon-fed money. Coincidently Person B is usually the person asking 'What price should I buy in?" only to ask later "What should be my selling point?" Person B basically wants to make money while putting forth minimal effort while everyone else spends dozens of hours TRYING to learn.

TLDR.... The lower the barrier for entry, the lower people's expectations of work are. Spoon-feed people information and they'll always be back for a second helping. This isn't a gaming community this is the stock market - everyone is expected to work.

1. MAXR - 10.74 % of the float shorted.
2. SPCE - 31% of the float shorted.
3. MSTR 17.6% of the float shorted.

All three had a nice run today. Any autists know of some other highly shorted stocks at risk for a squeeze?
Is this when you take a break ? So just sit money on the spac since it won't ever go below $10 anyway and just see if it pops while you chill? That's actually a pretty good idea lol.

I’m a big believer that the only person who knows the direction of the market is the one pushing it that way. 

My biggest losses all came from picking an exit point and “believing” it had to hit it. 

It’s incredibly hard to choose an exit point. The only way I’ve been able to do it is through reading loss of momentum in order flow. More often then not, I still leave a load on the table. Today I took 6 ticks on a 10 tick trade twice. 

It’s true I cut my winnings most of the time, but I also scratch more often then I lose and that adds up to a lot of protected capital. 

Picking profit taking and loss taking exits is a losers game. Only time it applies is when the exit point disproves your theory for entry. For example, you might believe resistance is strong at your price point, so breaking through it means you were wrong.
I’d actually be a millionaire, so that’d be pretty cool

I dont know what  other calls you made but if you looked at the technicals it was way overdue for a correction. You'll see a common trend among booming stocks that once the RSI hits 88-90 and the oscillator is peaking, a stock will flatline for a bit or dip. PLUG will definitely come back in the weeks to come but timing is key.

It's down a bit already after hours.  Time to buy
Cruise lines are cancelling them. Daughter had one cancelled yesterday, lady I work with had one cancelled today.
Hold or sell FCEL and TLRY? Want to buy BB instead (shares).

Gonna hold C C I V and GME (of course)
The Microsoft split made the average shareholder wait more than 10 years until the shares price went back to pre split levels
Yes. Now he has shares and April calls
The same move that it was yesterday, $GME my guy.
FCEL & PLUG - did he specifically mention the hydrogen industry?
what retarded app do you use that rings the bell 30 mins early?
The extra B adds 50% value but the Y is only usable some of the time.
That's awesome! :-)  
My entry was 0.0003, but I keep the TripZero plays very small since they rarely work out. Although, at 4500% thus far, I'm starting to reconsider increasing the lot sizes a little bit going forward.
It’s like he’s pissed that all of these “nobodies” are making great money on the current market. That’s the vibe I get from him everytime he talks shit about WSB
He’s autistic too. Group tendies

PLTR ICLN and steel happened
what reason would they have to shut it down....
$250 — $7k+ tomorrow. BB calls. I bought 75 1/15 $8c for 0.03 yesterday

haha, yeah, didnt even realise that.

i guess im waiting for the 420.69%

Your breaks should just be you buying LEAPs and not checking on them. Or buy shares of any ARK etf
Or 7:15 EST
A bird in the hand doesnt get me a lambo
The ONE time I sold covered calls on apha it spikes. Every other time I got left with bags cause I just held. I'd be up 30k vs 2.5k right now if I just held 😩
Have faith child. WSB has a new baby.

Don’t give up hope man

I was up 500% on ICLN $25 1/15
Just kept giving
Up, up and away! :-)
Give it some time and it will🚀🚀So yes, buy it now at a discounted price, if you will.
I'm of the opinion that this is one of the few things sustaining this bubble. A lot of people who bought in March/April 2020 are holding until they hit long-term territory.

Too long didn’t listen here’s an upvote pltr please fly again
100% agree. There is simply no other options. What should we do? Just put our cash under a mattress? It’ll just decrease exponentially over the years from inflation. I’ve always believe that since the 2008 crash, the rich and poor gap really started to truly begin. I think this continues for years to come and if inflation and increases in taxes get bad enough, the rich may take their money and leave. That is my biggest worry.
ICLN only has ~30% exposure to US, why ICLN over TAN or PBW?

Great job retard, now press the green button
Going balls deep on BB tmw after cashing out GME

also $11 billion for cybersecurity at the end there tho. big tendies afoot 🤔

What about green energy?
If we looked tomorrow and saw that short interest was drastically decreased, then that would be bad news for squeeze potential because that would mean that many already covered and we've already experienced a major squeeze.

If we look tomorrow and short interest is unchanged, that is good news for the squeeze potential because that would mean they haven't covered shit and our rocket up this week was organic buying and the squeeze hasn't even started.
Wow, GME and BB holding strong, and BBBY going absolutely vertical to join the party. Hell yeah!
Wow better growth than I'd imagined, good for them. Hope you don't mind all the probably Googlable questions but I don't know much about them and figured they've mostly been riding TSLAs coattails. Do they have dealerships? How's the value of their cars compare to a Model Y? With being so NOT vertically integrated in comparison, how can they compete? Is there demand for the product, is what I'm getting at.
I treat these shares like 1st edition Charizards. I see a price dip I'm adding more cash in hand.
I had 100 Jan 15 30 Calls that I sold on Tuesday for .07....I fucked myself with my paper hands.
In his latest update, he cashed out his 1/15 calls for $2.6 million, which makes sense, because otherwise he would have needed to buy those shares with cash to exercise the option. He still holds his April calls and 50000 shares.
You didn't "miss the squeeze " that's happening tomorrow
Where you going to college for $7500?
Why what’s up
You can of course, but as someone who paid mostly cash, and less than you are considering, to go back to school in middle age, think hard about it. That price is high and if you don’t need it for your work, consider it very carefully. I was surprised how little I learned. I had self educated to the point that most classes were not new information and many classes were the equivalent of the instructor simply reading over the PowerPoints that the textbook publisher provided. If you are going for a PhD, hopefully that would be better, but I’m not sure a masters program would be. Check out MOOC courses and other free online learning. Ask for a syllabus from some of the classes you would take and see what the classes cover. Sit in and observe some of the classes you would take in your program and not just the ones the “marketing” department suggests. Visit the academic department and ask the chair for permission to contact several professors for permission to observe. 

And of course, be sure to look at you and your husband’s budget and make sure you can afford it. 

If you’re attending school at night on top of full time work, you’ll be tired. I was wide awake and engaged for classes, which was great for learning, but then I would have trouble decompressing at bedtime and stay up too late, making the next morning difficult.
Too good to bee truee
If you thought there was gonna be a short term fairly big drop in the market, would you sell your longs? Like year out leaps or just open some short positions while still holding the longs
You forget Obiden is going to be pushing green everything. 👌
And considering apha is lower than tilray.. wouldn't it make sense to buy aphria now? 1aphria will be converted to 0.8381 tilray
Bad idea.
Tried BB before. The stock is cursed. Fundamentally, it is a good company but it is not love by wallstreet.
I opened a 3120/3140 spread. The cost is $1000 and my upside is $2000. The spread is currently in the money. I don't need a big movement. I just need AMZN to not fall after earnings.
Dbvt after hours!
I think he meant tent. He's gonna be living in a tent by the river.
haha man forgot about that
Not sure if GME will have a violent squeeze tomorrow. Maybe $50. The shorts are still in but they have the capital to sit around and wait for retail to paper hands.
That's my long term plan. I need more capital before I can invest in land though
sell low buy high 

foolproof strategy
Im fairly new to stocks so I can only buy a few shares at a time. I’ve been riding what Reddit tells me to invest in and my wealth is growing but I will probably end up cashing out as soon as I double my money. It’s sad that I can’t sink $10000 into anything yet. But hopefully within the next few wins I will be able to.
I freaking love goats they are so good at climbing

I highly recommend looking at /r/Boggleheads (and the bogglehead forum too) if you haven’t already. 

Last I went down the rabbithole of researching international asset allocations, you’ll more or less find sold arguments on both sides. Most boils down to splitting hairs over allocation vs world makeup, some words John Boggle mentioned in a book (regarding having no xUS), and just whether its worth the risk in general over US holdings.

Personally, I just go to the brokerage whitepapers on stuff like this. Fidelity’s is even similar to Vanguard’s. Speculatively, I see the U.S. as a waning superpower. I also would rather bet on the world rather than a particular region for long term investing.
It will be exceptionally difficult to get a high salary in a field you don't enjoy at all, because it is hard to remain employed (let alone get promoted) at a job where you have no interest in the foundational materials.

Most people who have high pay but dislike their jobs really love the underlying base challenge, but don't like other aspects of the job (work/life balance requirements; office politics; insufficient challenge; etc).  It's very rare to get and maintain those jobs while actively hating the core of the job.
I should at 33 expiring next Friday and bought at 39
Sold 1/2 my shares at 100% gainer. Playing with house money, so idgaf what happens to it
For some reason I had a brain fart and when you said split, I thought broken up instead of a stock split
He sold his calls for tomorrow for I think around 1-2 mil. He should be in with 5mil+

I'm not in GME but it's like Jesus -- either you believe in the short squeeze or you don't. If you don't, get out now and take profits. If you do, I think the bulls believe this is just the beginning, easily going to $80-100+
Fucking Cramer turning this into a dick measuring contest. Sure we have some power,  but we don’t have trillions of dollars worth of power; which all the other hedge funds and investment moguls do. 

And now these tycoons have a point to prove because their egos and pride have been damaged.

I'm actually all in GME. I dont even care anymore
This is glorious
It most likely is if it hasn’t gone away. Had one, just a bit of shit would come out when I squeezed it, then it would go flat for a bit and then puff up again. I went through that for weeks before I finally had it cut out, two stitches and it never came back

Just waiting on someone here to see the massive rise and post a massive DD post and have it sky rocket before the weekend only to crash on Monday, I would say wait until tomorrow to sell and then buy up the dumpster fire on Monday would be a good strategy. 

There are supposed to be more extraction results in Q2 so I wouldn’t be surprised if we see this above a dollar this year, some people would say three dollars by years end but I can’t see that happening unless A major battery producer announces they are using manganese instead of cobalt for their batteries permanently going forward. 


Considering this is the largest deposit in North America, I’d see these guys are definitely a good long game play for sure.

Not knocking GME because I'm balls deep and think it's still undervalued given the structural changes to the business model, but revenue is pretty meaningless if they aren't making money, and they aren't in spite of revenue.

That said every quarter has improved so they're losing less and less money, have a ton of cash, so the balance sheet should improve further.

Lots of reasons aside from the squeeze to be bullish on them, particularly if RC can deliver on whatever he's cooking up.
Post or ban
Yeah which is why some people can make profits on super OTM options when the stock never even gets close to the strike price but is heading in that direction

Hmm thanks mate. Maybe I should do that next time on my breaks. Sounds more stable and I can just not check on them since they aren't too volatile. I'm all in on TSLA shares during this break so i'm checking it daily to make sure it aint crashing lol.
"buttfuck that bush, I want 300 birds stat!"
Sure it's a generalization but that's the reality for people who were goaded into out of state or private universities by their parents and the government urging everyone to get a college degree.  Fortunately I went to a private, out of state school on a partial scholarship, and my family paid for the rest.

Wealth inequality is the biggest issue we face domestically (student loans making it harder for people to invest and/or save) and I empathize with people who sought out valuable degrees financed via debt.  

But you shouldn't be given a free pass for taking on debt and then asking for complete loan forgiveness.  There's no honor in that.
I don’t think you’re mentally stable, and you really shouldn’t be here. Mods please do everyone a favour here.
Not sure. I just mash buttons.
Lol boomer...try healthcare worker filthy casual 😉

But yeah CA kinda fucked themselves by being so restrictive to start (which I can kinda understand why) and no they’re playing catch up. The sooner they open the floodgates, the better IMO
He's still holding 50k shares and 1k calls.
That's exactly what Cramer was calling for them to do yesterday. Issue a stock offering to cash in.

PLTR should be stuck in your head all year
Preach brother 🙌🙌
Depending on how quickly the stimmy goes out, potentially a bunch of dudebros are gonna get $2k in their pocket right before the Super Bowl

DKNG would fly
Spurted my frappé reading this
If I do my math correctly, that’ll add 9billion to the market cap and boost PLTR 6 dollars
SENS wants 2 bucks tomorrow
Nah, if you're going to do short term calls you need to have 💎✋

The play was always going to be a multi-day squeeze. You should have only got in with an amount you were willing to see go to $0, and held through tomorrow for the potential payoff.
ARKK, ARKG, VTI.

whenever you need a break, shovel money into one (or all three) of those and delete your phone.
This isn't GME?
pretty sure its the other way. he bought long calls. he believed the option would be worth money. so he had the option to by 100 shares per contract at $20 per share. he had 1000 options contracts so he would have bought 100,000 shares for 2 million if he had exercised the option. or he could sell the options to other people to buy the shares.

I think you're thinking if he sold naked calls but didn't own the stock
ICLN is the most beautiful ETF to exist, ICLN gang loves ICLN

We out austim-ed the market. Don’t use the word smart with us
fuck em we are the rich now
Well they’re long dated so it just hurts to watch. I’m 100% not a bear, I actually played a few of the other bursts but got caught with Feb 27 strike short calls yesterday. I bought the puts to recoup the loss when it comes back down next month. (Been scalping calls throughout the day)

Even though I’m down net 6k at least this is some legendary shit so I ain’t even mad at it
Paper handz
Nice
That’s my point. Short term, it’s a quick spike for people who just went from $9-10 to 15. But every business that employs minimum wage workers, they’re not going to eat that labor cost and make less profit. So the price of the product goes up. Maybe not by 50%, since labor is only part of your overhead cost. But a significant amount nonetheless. 

Then you have to pay your skilled workers more to make it worth putting in the effort to get an above-minimum-wage skillset. 

All it does is raise the cost of living. It always catches up, and in a few years you’re right back where you started and $15/hr isn’t a living wage any more.
Yes because we all got rich and boomers 401k’s all went down

Wow, a wild value stock appears in this sub!  Thanks, this one wasn't on my radar.  Amazing that it's only trading a few bucks above last March lows.
Yessir I think the GME squeeze this week was triggered by a Cramer tweet that same morning, and now he’s pumping it on his show
V interesting stuff I guess this is what you learn outside of special math class
Ya i planned to jump in tmrw from a week ago because i wont have liquidity until then and ofc it moons the day before. With my luck its gonna moon to $25 and then dip to $24 so might as well buy now like the fucking retards we are

The GME squeeze hasn't even HAPPENED yet, and they're going to dogshit a company that has doubled in 2 days and shows no signs of slowing down for a company that could announce a 5 billion dollar contract with the Coast Guard and still not move.   That's peak retard.
Ngl but I started with 3000 and already made 6k profit, in 1 minute. Make the correct decisions, do your DD and trust your gut.
Time to buy more GME
Dude I over-drafted my bank account to use as cheap margin for GME.
Not even Warren Buffett is in this camp these days although he clearly was in his early days.
Just bought 19 shares of BB. Guess I'm joining you guys.
I got done for June
Niceeee
Congrats Dr.Retard
Yeah... wsb is at fault for the current market environment /s
Popping this month
He posted it like 2 hours ago
Exactly what I did, PLTR does not move...
I hope I regret it
It was an all cash deal, so it should be given back to you in cash. I don't know what the exact amount per share is. The acquisition is still pending further antitrust investigations.
This is turning into the Key and Peele skit where they talking about robbing the place by slowly working there over 30 years lol

OI on 24p 1/15. I can’t see anymore because RH is gay, but the position requires about 5 million shares to cover.
That's what I'm betting on. And all the morons who pre ordered the new OJ Bronco. 

Got mine in white 👍
I don’t see a serious dip happening until a week or more.  And by that time, you’ll have missed out on more gains.  

It literally doubled.  If people were going to mass sell, we would have seen that.  But half my point is that even with mass selling, the price can’t go down, because shorts basically need to buy every single share to cover.  They are losing (in interest alone) about 3% of their initial investment every week.  That’s a terrible investment.  They need to cover

How high will it go
Everyone jumping off TSLA and onto GME? I thought for sure TSLA would moon again with Biden speaking, but here we are
BB on NYSE
When did you sell?
your stock seems to be mooning. congrats!  it's funny that the ticker is SNES backwards.
PING about to POP
Aside from all the money I'll make, I'll be genuinely really impressed and happy that that retarded dinosaur of a company was able to turn itself around. Gamestop pivoting to lead a digital game store change would be so ironically hilarious to everyone who has dunked on them (deservedly so) for the last like 14 years.
Until it done
People who have never had to pay that amount of taxes out of their pocket always say this shit.

Taxes are theft. They suck.
if you want to trade in a retirement account go for a Roth IRA so you don’t have to pay taxes on gains. Note you will not be able to withdraw any funds from it until retirement age unless you want to take a 10% penalty fee.
Ive been in since 2018....get me back to green boys. 300 at $13.01 and still have room to avg down lol

BYND .... Take profits while you can ... Lets go short or buy puts!!! ... BYND not making product for Taco Bell this year ... THEY ARE NOT SELLING IT TO THEM THIS YEAR! THE ANOUNCEMENT WORKED FOR US NOW ITS TIME TO TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN! Thankfully nobody seemed to have really understood the semantics of the announcement. They are simply exploring a new product that will be TESTED in the NEXT YEAR .. this means that their experiment if it goes well may begin selling in 2022.
That’s tendie money!
The top news story on ABC News Tonight is that the Feds are preparing to defend against domestic terrorists. That's pretty sobering. 1995
I bought over 1,000 shares cause why the fuck not.

Stimulus is $1400 and it doesn’t come until next month. BB is going to dip, I would wait to get in then.

Hey thanks
Your method is wrong. What happens when you put two variables together? You square them. 

Blackberry makes computers. Computer run on some kind of weird English. In computers B = 66

BB = B^2 = 66^2 = $4356

Can’t find it under account settings. Plz elaborate because I’m autistic
It’s not profit.  The stock goes down by the amount of the dividend payout.  DRIP is equivalent to selling and then soon after rebuying back in the same amount.

Wrong move. Now those may pay off, but it's pretty solidly risky with IV in Mars orbit right now. The play here is to sell puts to benefit from super high IV or buy shares.

No, in his contract with CNBC he cannot personally own stocks he talks about on his show.  He does, however, run a charitable fund that donates profits.  You have to join his private club to see the portfolio, and being a former member I can tell you that many of the names you hear about on the show are in there.  But it is a well-balanced portfolio of cyclical and growth stocks, so even if he wasn’t on TV it would make a good mix.
I am a GME 🐻 but since I have zero positions, and I see so many people prospering, I am bullish for you all. Best wishes to the tendies✋✋✋
I have no clue to be honest, but given the situation and the amount of volume traded, $50 - 55 does not seem out of the question.
50 or squeeze tomorrow.
Not an insider, so I am not sure. Nothing immediately obvious to an outsider I mean. But they just announced another successful project with Tate&Lyle, who make sweet&low and other artificial sweeteners using enzymes.
Only some brokers allow it and only after you make a special request.  

But don't worry,  you can buy shares now and strap on for the ride.

Ah haha! You're absolutely right!

And I got 3 fucking upvotes!

I love this sub so much.
Here’s the thing: tech is here to stay. This idea of ‘cycling’ out of tech stocks is unlikely to happen for longer than a day. The world has changed and covid progressed it about 5 years when it was lagging.

Wall Street is catching up, albeit slowly. 

The difference going forward will be in how the tech “presents” itself in different ways. For example, I think you should have 100% tech and you’d have a great long term portfolio, but drilling down, you have a number of very computer-oriented ones. 

Think outside the box a bit - TEAM is great but maybe choose between it and MSFT, or between MSFT and AAPL for that matter.

eg. Consider something like PTON for a way of using tech to create communities and change the world of exercise. Consider cybersecurity like CRWD or NET.

Some health stocks which rely heavily on tech like TDOC; PINS for social media tech...the possibilities are endless.
So what I bought in at 40 what does it matter if it moons another +20%
Was down bc of PLUG sold and yolo’d everything into SPCE 32 calls expiring tomorrow right at the dip. Sold 30min later could have made more but holly fuck I’ll take my 70% and run.
So I was supposed to hold my 1/15 25/26c?

45% interestmeana you pay 45% of borrowed stock value per year. If you want to short the 100k stocks available at iborrowdesk (assuming a price of 40$) you pay 40*100k/365=10960 dollars per day while shorting. 

If you short now you need it to fall fast to make money.
Just make enough and it won’t matter

I almost bought a Valve Index VR headset with some of today's realized gains, got as far as putting it in the shopping cart on Steam, and then thought "I could buy a ton of options with this $1000" and cancelled the transaction. 

GME 4/16 8C, GME long shares, BB 1/29 10C, PLTR 5/21 30C
You could start a paid discord and post your movies in real time
When do they expire ?
My 7 $30C 1/15 expire tomorrow for GME. After I exercise those I’m buying $4,000 in $55 1/22 ASAP
that’s gonna be tough. they just lost another plane out of Jakarta a few days ago...
I flipped a call option in $GME overnight for $546! I could have held and been greedy to probably make more money but decided to pull it out and pocket the profit today.
Give me an actual honest tl;dr on why it will continue to go up tomorrow and I’ll drop 4.3k in shares right now
Where is it in setting? I don’t see it anywhere?
Holy fuck my first proper comment ever in this sub and all I'm doing is posting confirmation bias for myself to not feel alone in this gamble, and all you idiots follow suit... This truly is an autists paradise

IRS charges you 10% for taking money out of your 401k.  You could have just moved that over to an IRA on webull without taking the hit I believe.... that said, I'm not sure how "borrowing" works as you said it.  Do you still have to pay the IRS 10% if you return it by end of year?
i personally leave the retirement accounts on boomer mode and ignore it because i know i will fuck them up.
TSX follows the NYSE,  hit the TSX

Missing out on GME made me say fuck it and throw some money down on BB.  Im such a moron.  Hopefully a rich moron tomorrow.
Probably going to incur a lot of wash sales and end up owing taxes for 2021 while generating no profit lol

ahhh, that's not even high, we were seeing like 600+.
just dont lose in your retirement account as it won't be tax deductible. however, any gains you won't have to pay taxes on until you actually retire.
Yesssssirrrrr 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
If a low dividend yield stock like NVDA makes you so emotional, you can just not buy it. You know that right?

Don’t think a squeeze is doable here.. Short ratio of 2, Bbby is more likely for a squeeze @ 7. BB is just gonna have a nice run up and maybe drop next week to around where it’s at now IMO
Is the evidence showing these are new investors? There must have been *some* sort of short squeeze. I don’t see how a stock could nearly double in 2 days based off rather small news. 

Also, if you’re correct it hasn’t, is there a reason to think the short squeeze ever *will* develop? I mean I don’t see why $40 a share would be much different than $100 a share. Either way, you’re a fuckin moron if you’re actually still shorting it at that point. So what’s to think their irrationality will stop at 100 versus 40?

Generally holding one sector adds to your tick as you lack diversification.  It is tricky now as global trackers will hold amazing, Facebook etc as their largest holdings.

Ya I agree there’s a lot of fake gurus out there that make most of their money from selling courses, I don’t think Jeremy is one of them. He’s one of the only YouTubers that actually talks about the dangers of the market and to always have some cash. You act like we are all children, we can make our own decisions. I’m more then positive we all know how YouTube works that he’s clickbaiting when their is (next 10x stock, 2x stock quick) I’m also up over 1000% on Tesla so that definitely made me rich lol
Our German brothers are helping fight the good GME fight as well!!!!??! This is not going to end well for Melvin the whole world is against em!
35 mins. 7:15 EST
No.  But it seems like clean energy to me.
Can I borrow $20? I’m good for it I swear
I wonder what will happen tomorrow morning now that Jim told tbe public that "there's not enoigh shares to go around". 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
How much you making now?
I just bought some after hours because I want some tenders
Yea and now IV is fucked
Super different business. It won’t.
Is it a thread or a video or what? I wanna see
Lmao and BBBY
It's because your not being paid to manipulate the market with a shitty salary while wearing a polar fleece vest.
Same fam. I have faith
Open a roth, trade in there. Gains are tax free and no worries about wash sales. I primarily trade in my Roth myself.
Get calls

I’d subscribe to his OnlyFans
Literally every time I buy anything tbh
He heard it directly from his anus
TYCF starting to ride too
Etoro has social trading which does exactly this... copy someone else!
PLTR 870 PER share by 2088?
SAVE up 9% today
I picked up 300 calls. Should have got more. Up $30k already
Don't take money out of your Roth. 1.) Long term capital gains tax is lower than short term. 2.) You will get penalized
What kind of cult?
He got diamond hands💎
This subreddit is /r/options not /r/wallstreetbets. Just a joke about how one is traditionally well thought out plans, vs the absolute meme potential the mass of WSB wields. I usually try to keep it tame here just in the spirit of respecting people who aren’t degenerates like me.
Hmm ok good point. I sold at $28 and saw it kept going up and didn’t want to FOMO.. GME 🚀🚀🚀
I have no idea why mods removed my post, and now it can't be linked again for 90 days...

But for those who missed it, a WSJ article on WSB and GME:

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-stock-soars-and-social-media-traders-claim-victory-11610653679?mod=hp\_lista\_pos2](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-stock-soars-and-social-media-traders-claim-victory-11610653679?mod=hp_lista_pos2)
> in the hopes that when one of you shitheads decides to eat lego

Is this actually bad for you?  I mean... they come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and bold attractive primary colors.
AMC short squeeze
It was kind of wild getting mentioned at first since I’ve been a long time lurker, and only in the last year became an active member. WSB has seriously been a crash course for me thats started to pay off. But we’re getting too much attention. Cramer needs a new hobby.
So do i sell my GME$ Stocks on Friday before it closes?  


Or do i hold and let it ride for when it opens again Monday?  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀
BB stock split in 2022 confirmed
are you fucking kidding? if i was sitting on top of a 7 million dollar pile of GME i'd be posting about it every time the shit moved 10 cents.
Very high, especially based on how many millionaires were made here in the last week memeing GME

Does technical analysis still work in this volatile market?
I got 42c and 46c 1/15
Fcc em!!! 💯💎💎💎🙏🏾
BB
Puts on Twitter then!
Absolutely. 

If I sold you a call and you paid 300 dollars premium on it I definitely could buy one for 100 dollars and close it out. Profit 200$

Me as the writer/seller could also just hope it expires worthless and I'll get the whole 300$.
Don't be that retarded
If you truly are a student of Buffett, you'll learn that selling is usually the worst thing unless you are sure that the new investment will do so much better than the original plus any tax bill you'll be paying. Read a lot. As you put new money into the account and invest using your newly learned skills, the old investments will become less of a % of the portfolio.

The point is to not rush to any extremes, in anything. Don't "the fool in the shower" (to use a Milton Freedman quote) who rushes to extremes, going back and forth between philosophies based on the latest book you've read.
it's a bit fiddly and not very useful.
I have the same god damn calls. I averaged up when i was down $150 and now im down $200 lmao.
New to this shiz.. what do I invest in???
NOW. BB TO $25
Idk how in UK?
I had a cyst in my ass that had to be removed. I'm not kidding, it was the most painful shit I've ever dealt with. You don't truly know how many times you clench your ass until any movement there makes you wanna pass out. Was given 200 Oxys after. Worst part is that it only got worse when it healed.

I asked you for a number that's hard to get.

The fact that you are unable to find it doesn't make the question trolling.

The fact that you are unable to find it proves my point.

Thank you so much for facilitating.
Ye but normies arent diamond hands so they can fuck off
GME AND HOLD
the reddit is beautiful autists, the discord is full of poor retards posting pictures of their couple hundred dollar gains and acting like inbreds
TIL I’m a Gen X dad haha
Sounds like you did good then considering the shitty weather.
No idea but I was in just before close and sold out for 50% profit AH. I have a feeling it will climb through tomorrow but 50% in an hour felt too good to pass up.
Nope just in time for next week calls
That’s why government doesn’t tax the rich do hard. We need the rich, they keep the system flowing. But we also need the middle man to be happy as they are the majority and we don’t want the masses to revolt. Lol this is getting too political. 

That’s why I expect a boom in the coming years, There really is no alternative st this point. 

As average people we can only do one thing, ride the waves as good as we can, and try to be on the uppercase if the gap. Looking purely from a money perspective.
I am on the verge of going balls deep in AMD by swapping all my Tesla
Fuck luck. This is WSB. We don't work off luck.

Don’t worry, employees won’t see any of it
With something like that, you pray and prepare yourself to lose 100% of your investment. Generally speaking, it is best to not buy far-OTM weeklies the day before expiry unless you are good with losing everything you put in. In the future, I’d suggest sticking to contracts that expire at least a month out
Buzz your girlfriend. WOOF.
Should I go heavy in stocks or go 1/22 calls
Define low.

Personal opinions on wage and FIRE success as a single individual, no dependents, started saving early in career -

Federal minimum wage: yeah no keep dreaming

40k pre-tax: it’s a stretch but if you’re in a low COL area it’s possible. Early retirement might mean 60

60k pretax: you’re probably able to max your 401k; it’s a long con but totally possible by 50-55 in MCOL or less if you keep up a solid savings rate.

75k and above: you’ll probably make it in 90% of the United States by 50. Bay Area, LA, San Diego, Seattle, and NYC excluded. You won’t have a lambo but you’ll be reasonably comfortable.
you spelled PLTR wrong
Maybe you should think about some other investment options.
Why is everyone here so easily convinced... I'm sorry don't hate me I know nothing
In all seriousness, ask at r/investing. It's a valid question.
Learnt this lesson too past couple days
I’m part of both, Godspeed my fellow tards.
Why is PLTR there though?
I was about to say though...

No one here claims to have out*smarted* institutions. 

Frankly, I'd say we out-retarded them so goddam hard that we came full circle and are winning
Same
There are different type of market crashes. During a catastrophe or financial credit crisis..all stocks go down. The best place to be are in low debt companies but nonetheless there isn't much you can do. See 2008 or 2020

If the crash is due to a contraction in valuations however.. everything will *still* go down.. but some will go down less than others..and then only those that were fairly valued to begin with will recover. See  1999, 1929.
Same I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower. But you make more money as a leader.
Retards and autists yes
Come on IWM keep going up
So BABA did not behave like an EV stock today after all...
WSB has flown to close to the sun
papis
Very interesting I was looking a couple days ago and it looked like it wanted to break
calls on cauliflour rice
Going to see what GME does. Because it’s up another $2 ah and insiders are selling.
Why the hmmm?
Fuck
I'm balls deep in this tommorow
Lol I actually stopped believing in GME after their earnings killed the stock for a while. The fundamentals seemed so crap I didn't think there would be news that would cause it to pop. Shows what I know I guess. But I did want to get in on that ZM dip sigh. I Guess these are the opportunities you miss when you are chilling.
Dad ?

Buy GME shares
Lets go!
Collateralize the loans on both and do both. Don't liquidate your means of making money.
It may drop some, which is when you should buy. I don’t see it going below $35-33 again though. $100 price point is early 2022. Ryan Cohen is turning this ship around.
As long as you occasionally post the list on here then gteat
You aren't as smart you think you are.
Cancelled before fill at $1200, fixing to expire around $33k tomorrow
Their future posts should be flared appropriately
All my heavy hitters are deep red

But my small positions are BLOOD GREEN

So I guess that’s cool. Thx TLRY

Can someone give me the 30 second ELI5 on why BB is still relevant and worth the chance?

I'm not a doubter, I'm a know-nothing-er who missed the memo that they were even still in business. Too poor for years to even think about stock (other than chicken), so I missed a lot of tech news. Why is this one set to blast off, exactly? :)
My dear friend. Pain is temporary, but pride is forever!
I have a 1k account and trade spreads all the time. Always close your position before expiration. Then you most likely won't get assigned.

When you do spreads, the whole point of it is to cover yourself from getting assigned. When you buy a call you have the option to buy stocks at a strike price, and when you sell a call you may get assigned to sell stocks at the strike. So if you do get assigned on the sell call rh should automatically exercise your buy call to cover it. 

Last thing if you have single leg options, rh should sell your position before you get assigned on expiration.

Been here since 2017, fam 💕
This is the way, but are you good bro?
Theres like 6 stocks that start with bb
No no, it will need a stock split along the way: $520
Earned it buddy
All in on ICLN, I’ll have the last laugh next week.
This was me on my 100 x 30Cs on Tuesday and should I sell them for a measly $700 bucks. 

That would have been 100K...
Tbh I’ll what any of this means and I then I saw rockets. I only have $500 on my account and I know it’s not a lot but where/ how do I yolo it cuz I wanna be as much of a retard as possible
Bought back in at 9700 GME shares
That was the last  set that came out before I lost interest for a while. Great memories. Those are probably a good price since everyone is so focused on the very early stuff.
I theta Ganged my way to 7k from 3.5k now we yolo and see what happens
Tsla goes through cycles on this sub. It will kill off a good number of people portfolios, stay down for a little while, then pump again. R.I.P. sept 2020. I was there

England, I use trading 212 so pretty sure I get the US stuff as well.

Uranium miners. Nuclear energy has been left out of the investing picture, but we need it to achieve our environmental goals. Japan and China are also investing in nuclear. There is currently a uranium supply deficit.

Who knows, it’s the government. I alway go back to Ronald Reagan’s famous quote on the MO of government -  “If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it.  If it stops moving  subsidize it”.

Want to check back in a week?
Sleepyjoekun
Here come the Cramers
Why the fuck did I ignore all the GME noise
I'll get $GME tatted on my body if it hits $100 by EOM
My play would be a version of that with theoretically no risk, since shorting 838 Tilray and buying 1000 Apha makes you net neutral post merge. But, it would net you 3-4k minus any shorting fees unless I’m missing something
It’s coming bro
How much does it need to move up for 55 call 21 to move up? is 2$ enough?
When is the optimal time to sell? Thanks in advance. Learning the ropes
Jesus Christ. I hope you recover nicely

Uh oh, the flood has begun
Sorry I’m retarded
I'm not exactly sure what happens to stocks in hyper inflation so maybe someone else can enlighten me. But I would think your safest bet would be to invest in some foreign stocks

However, if usd crashes there's no reason that the whole world exonomy wouldnt crash. So in that case I suppose the best thing to hold would be gold

HOWEVER, if theoretically usd did crash to basically nothing which I doubt it will. Bitcoin would literally be unbelievably valuable, and could literally hit any number. Even like trillions or higher. Not saying this would or even could happen but it would be wild lol
It reminds me of the beginning of the game "The Oregon Trail"
2188*
Taxes. If nothing else, Hold onto your shares until you have had them for at least a year to avoid having to pay out taxes on your gains at a higher rate. I'm in a similar position as you. Learning about capital gains tax has made this decision easier.
F
Lol unfortunately pltr barely has any shorts
I had 1100 in the bank at 16 you autist
TenCent along with baba are being looked at for a blacklist it was all over the place last week
Arnt they to expensive?
Buying OPK. They own Bioreference labs and the Biden healthcare stimulus plans is allocating $50B for testing and $130B for reopening schools. Bioreference is already doing the biggest school districts in the country now. Market cap is $3B. Also a few drugs that will be approved this year. OPK is severely undervalued
If a stock has a $39-$40 bid-ask in AH, an I likely to get filled at 39.5 for a sell order?
Shares my dude.  IV will fuck you.
Good call. WSB is leaking. These pumpers try and recreate the hype and then their stock flounders. Meanwhile at GME, backed by legitimate multi-year DD by some posters (YD? Yearly diligence?) that shit took off and didn't stop.
I just bought TSLA today, now what?
I bought yesterday before the drop today like a fucking idiot
WUPFH
Duh
How is all this good for GME? In my country GME shops closing  left and right.. how is this good business?
So we’re squeezing beyond meat and bbby too?
Don’t know what playing being a bitch means but if you mean take off my gfs underwear no
Just move to a no state income tax state for a year
Tendies seller: Miss, this is a Wendy's

Daughter: Nah, this is Robinhood fym fam

u/Bear_Sharp: DAUGHTER, YOU WATCH YOUR MOUTH. You know we don't use Robinhood!
Volumes are too low. All spread out over 20 countries and markets. They should merge all the euro stock markets together to 1 and close all the others. Then it might get some rocket moving volumes on some stocks. Also, buying euro stocks as a european with a european broker is often like 5 to 10 times more expensive in brokerage fees than buying usd markets.
But you could buy a clean 7.3 power stroke ford that will appreciate faster than a house and still be a truck
Not sure I understood a word you just said but I agree 🚀
This motherfucker is going to rrrrriiippppppp!

Excited to see it go, there has been months and months of great partnerships,  settlements and strategic announcements,  if this pumps for one or two more days it will start grabbing the worlds attention and then we are eating tendies off the bare boobs of beautiful ladies....  or that’s what I’m doing anyways.
Who’s relationships have been going sour recently?
I’m not sure PLTR belongs in that gang yet
Yeeess, go BB, be the next gme
Wheres that son of a bitch that said GME would go to $500 I wanna suck his dick real quick no homo.
omg GME is the next TSLA
Are options still good? Or do we yolo into shares ??
Not really sure, a little above my pay grade.. But I would suspect we'd know covering by way of price action and data on shares shorted..
Buy at open
I really need some rescue package green.
All the trannies hard
UH OH
Its my weekly lotto scratcher. Did ya think it hit 39$ twice?
You won’t be disappointed. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Thanks for the tip mate. Arkk been pumping last few days too, would of been good to pop it in that on Monday while I take my time off. Arkg too.

I'll pop them on my watchlist and chill out with them next time.
> THE MODS ABUSE THEIR POWER AND PERMANENTLY BANNED ME FOR NOTHING

good
She’s miles ahead of most people here already lol
Or else I'm fucked and the 20 idiots who followed me for no apparent reason
First of all that’s Down syndrome. Secondly, YouTube. Kamikaze Cash (Mikey Millions) does a decent job explaining basics, plus he is entertaining. If you want a book, the book “Understand Options” is an easy read
That's not a bad way of thinking about it. I appreciate the advice and insight!
Do I buy shares now or wait for a dip at open?
Dayummmmmm
What positions are you looking at ?
No, of course not. People whine about taxes but paying a lot in taxes just means you made even more. You'll potentially get to enjoy the fruits of your investment, so why not? IMHO spreading things out in a balanced manner is best, so don't ignore retirement accounts of course. 

Of course I'm no DeepFuckingValue so I basically know nothing.
$WOOF.
Gamma squeeze due to hedging of positions today I think. No way that was the bulk of the short squeeze.

if you don't give a shit about the facebook thing the Quest 2 is pretty awesome for $300.

You can also do this with a VM on a shit laptop but I haven't really looked into it too much.
Yo, did this just get banned? what's with the auto moderator?
Please explain
Hold up there Jimmeh - WSB created some of finest DDs one could need to invest in proper ticker. Memes and stuff is one thing, but among those there is shit ton of very valuable info. Once you get past initial retardation you don't need to get info from anywhere else to successfully trade shares. Sometimes even options.
The FB drop lately honestly doesn't make sense. 
Their earnings are gonna be monsterrr. There was insane levels of adspend in q4 on their platforms

I've bought and sold CRM 3x in as many months -- each time at, like, a $10 loss, each time to invest in a meme (or pre-meme) stock. Degeneracy has set in. 

Long term I'm bullish, definitely plan to buy in again at some point.
Starting to smell like we're going to be the fall guys
What ever happened to the earnings threads?  I miss the loud wails of agony and incoming/inevitable loss porn follow ups.
If you watch how the difference in price moves between strike prices as the share price goes up, you’ll see there is greater change at the higher OTM strike price than the lower ITM strike price

+ imagine buying the $40 strike for $20.23

+ as share price goes up, that cost will go up to $25.75 where the $20 atrike price us now (using the numbers you wrote above as example)

+ that $50 strike price for $15.63 will be worth more as the share price increases - to maybe $20.23 where the $40 strike price is now

+ the difference is less between the $20 and $30 strike prices

Buy cheaper OTM to open contract

+ sell when the contract gains in higher change in premium when it is closer to ITM
In highschool I needed surgery to remove a pilonidal cyst removed from my ass crack. Friggin traumatic bub, plastic surgeon said it was the worst case he’d seen

I'm deep into that now.  I retired from internet marketing 20 years ago.  I've been studying YouTube for a while now, and my attitude is "this looks trivial, why does everyone think this is difficult?"

I have not yet made my first official video, so maybe they are right.  I am mystified and can't wait for COVID to relax so I can begin my channel.
Your ass? Or the oxy addiction?
I'm like this close 🤏 to selling some Tesla to double down on GME tomorrow...
Ill send you a post card from mars
Got no money left all in GME at least until tmr but thanks for the advice.
Right! I thought everyone here would lose their ass. That’s why I am not missing the BB train.
So should i buy tomorrow at opening bell? 🧐

Lying 🐻
I would caution against going too headlong into this. Let’s remember that during Obama’s *eight* years in power, sure some EPA rules got changed and goals were set, but arguably most of the boost in renewables was a result of the sectors own innovation and long term outlook. He was able to get ultimately ~80 billion spent, so this talk of hundreds of billions isn’t grounded in political reality. Much of that money was in the form of tax credits, so although both allow more money into the game, it’s not quite the same as JPow printing money. 

But wait? That 80 billion wasn’t even passed by itself! It was part of the 2009 bailout and stimulus attempts. **One**bill in 8 years, the Recovery Act. Most of the stimulus train already left the station this time around. Plain old stimmy money can’t affect stock prices the way actual forward investments and innovation can. And too much money just gets wasted (Solyndra). Not only that, these programs aren’t always effective anyways. One tiny example: You know all that money poured into energy efficient fridges? [One study found](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9gysfmwwsmfkmz5/Houde%20and%20Aldy%20AEJ-Policy%202017.pdf?dl=0) that 90% of people would have purchased one of them anyway.
To all the people calling me a clown yesterday for buying gme at 35

I do, I guess that could be it
Of course, there was an outbreak in the U.S. and Europe in Nov/Dec 2019. The cases were simply misdiagnosed.

No problem. PM me if you need any help with it. I do quite a bit of pine script development.
That applies to stocks as well.
GME is still fueling too tho, it will keep mooning for a few days but i own both so 🤷‍♂️💎🤲
APHA
Lol. This sub would make money from funeral Home companies if there was a squeeze.
some people are just so lucky
Options? Expiry? Tbh if it's the end of the week you'll probably lose on it
I'll finger my butthole at $300
🚨 if you’re a tranny DM me 🚨
if youre talking about the ones expiring tomorrow theres an 80% chance you will lose all your money.
It’s not a bubble if I made $$$
In a week, replace “GameStop” in all these headlines with Blackberry.
No problem. He referred to us several times, but yes now many people will be seeing this piece and looking deeper into GME.

Enjoy the ride new wave of people, this could be the biggest short squeeze in history.
please biden make it so i dont get screwed over for buying these dips i am begging you.
Being leader seems fun. Making people suck ur dick and shit

Wtf it’s not too late lmao. I bought at above 40 and I’m green already

Who the fuck says "ducking"?
wait for short squeeze
I’m super confused because I’m not well-versed in the music industry sector.

So, when you go into a restaurant and they have music on in the background, the restaurant would have to pay to use that background music?
The drugs and gambling kind.
75 shares at 19$ No idea what im doing but making some good bucks for a 19 yrr old :))
Shit, this is kid can barely talk and still probably has more tendies than me
My bro is playing this and mentioned it to me. If I wasn't almost all in GME I would hop in.
Have a non-paywall transcript?
restaurants that have venues for musicians to play and charge to heart them should be paying a royalty to the original artists. After all, it was originally that artist's hard work in the case of cover bands. Only about 15% of venues pay royalty licensing fees because its prohibitively expensive for smaller places. Soundstr provides a pay-as-you-go model which means that everyone pays their fair share AND the royalties are going to end up in the right pockets because the data is just better. It's a win-win for everyone. The talent in the music industry seems to love this concept and I believe it will take off.
Thanks for asking for more info. Well when it healed it created a fistula. Check it out online. Basically a tunnel from where the cyst was opened. Had to have a bunch of hot nurses come in everyday and looks at my assholes. Definitely the best part IMHO.
Actually, yes, dailies. 55 1/15 calls have been moving between as lows as $0.4 and $2.5 today.
He fuckin better
how do you buy an option? i used fidelity and robinhood
What’s the asking price?
No way
Wait so do you just see the trending stocks for the day on this subreddit then buy and hope it goes up?
BB🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀GME

Balls deep, folks. I got only a little money from GME 1/15 calls but I'm all in. Take me to tendie town.
I'm creaming myself right now that I got orders filled for stock and 1/22 9.50 calls like two minutes before close.
June?? Not sure we have to wait that long 😎
Why is BB up?
Stop I need to get in tomorrow
Tomorrow
When does this hell end. I sold my $6.5c 1/29 BB  option for ICLN. What a clutz
Sorry man I didn't see how long ago you made your comment, I'm just browsing through haha. Good job though, seriously you made a great mode on dumping your position, you rode the shit out of that rollercoaster.

I think I'm going to get into BB tomorrow also, but just like you I'm going to buy shares, I don't think options is the right move for me with regards to BB you know?
Or a time traveler....
I don't pay taxes in Switzerland.
Should’ve held my 1/15 40c huh :/ at least I’ve got 1/29 55c and some shares still
Buy at open or you’re retarded
I would give this comment Gold, but I spent all my money on GME
When will calls be available? When they print I want be like 
“ who let the dogs out “ 
Woof woof
Sir this is a Gymboree
Proof?
😂😂😂😂
Please don't thank me lmao you have no idea if this was a good or a terrible investment...
Get in now.  The cavalry are dealing with GME right now.  We are just getting the launch pad ready and doing pre flight checks.  As soon as they arrive this shit will explode. Compared to other cyber security firms BB is tiny.  Could easily reach $50 by end of Jan.
First purchase will be GME, cause it’s headed to Pluto 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🪐
Why are people speaking Greek at this casino

ENPH PUTS!!!!!!
Dream on lol. If it even hits $50 tomorrow, we'd be lucky
remember how long Tesla shorts held on, those shorting GME have deep pockets, let’s take them for all they’re worth! not selling till over 100!
I just got my tax statement from Ameritrade - they listed every trade I did last year.  Irs is well aware of what we are doing
Buy GME
What’s that you say.. buy 100 more shares?! DONE AND DONE!

Lol bb is in 60 million cars and it’s going to be important for autonomous driving let’s ride this 🚀 I’m buying shares though lol
This is the way.
We need the data showing that those prices are possible, $40 seems like a huge landmark but does the rocket have the gas to keep going?
Theta eat us alive till Elon come to the rescue with his power & might.
Just an opinion: turn down the music a bit so we can hear you rap
Thanks, you too! Let’s keep it going 🚀
What is a realistic price target for tomorrow? 10.5 and then sell off after open? Or a meteoric rise to 15$
GME for triple digit . You never missed it out . Those chicken tenders are hot from the oven
You're in for a treat
Buy BB or GME shares right now?
My only concern is Sherman not letting the squeeze run before he pulls out the shelf offering.

We better see at least $100 first they let the shorts off the hook.
We can’t dilute the the squeeze all the troops to gme 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
It’s shit sell. I’m selling my calls at open
whenever my futures order gets filled it IMMEDIATELY goes the opposite direction.  I'm putting my bids in below the market from now on, fuck this
Amazon cucking me harder than a guy’s girlfriend having an only fans...
Wasn’t that yesterday?????
Nah we just have to pump it with upvotes harder than we pumped GME so it gets to front page.
First of all. The share float is significantly lower than 3 to 4 years ago. Therefore each share is worth more. 

Secondly, the trading environment is drastically different. Retail is totally FOMO'ing and the shorts are absolutely panicking. 

They aren't even close to out of the woods. Tomorrow will be fireworks.
Yeah I'm considering more if it continues it's recent trend.

Noone say APPS? seriously?
Yeah agreed. Those are just my biggest worries for the country. My goal is to have enough money saved to leave the country when/if things get bad enough. I do think we’re years and years away from that happening though.
In this case your not betting on a direction of the industry overall, your betting the company you bought the call on will gain market share from the company bought the put on. Like earlier in the year if thought AMD was going to saor and you bought calls but the reason you thought that was because intel would be handing them customers due to delays and being bad or whatever, then perhaps you’d want to do what your describing. I’m not a pro or anything, this is just how I see it.
Yup that's the one!
People should not worry about the SEC or funds or whatever coming after a message board that is so retarded it wouldn't know what to do with insider information. We should do what financial institutions do and get a self-regulating body to pretend like we are all in compliance. Can call it BALLSDEEP.
Absolutely.
pissed I missed out on BB. Good DD by the guy, spot on. Ugh. Bummer.
Short squeeze hasn’t even started. Not too late 🚀🚀🚀
QCLN
They are just betting that they can outspend us. In the end, this is what it is, the first one to flinch losses, and they are dead sure we're going to start selling when people start having nice gains, sending this down. If we can't get a perpetual flow of new buyers, they are going to win. They can just post more and more collateral to maintain their positions until the selling starts. It's going to be interesting.

It’s encouraging to see another middle aged person who went back to school.

I’m not really looking to gain more knowledge (although that would be nice, too) but the degree would give me the opportunities I would like to have access to in my field which I don’t have access to without this degree.

My husband and I could afford the payments. 

Another question, though - can I even withdraw nearly the entire amount? It’s at just above 30,000 and I need just under 30,000.
There's still so much time left on GME.

Okay, maybe I should've explained better, but this is what has happened so far: I was selling puts on a stock, and I got eventually assigned since it closed below the strike. I've been selling covered calls since then on this 100 lot. So, now I'm just wondering if there's any difference between using the option rollover tool, as opposed to just let the covered call expire worthless, and then just buying the next contract.

PLTR calls at open for me.
I think personally it might die down a little and people might panic sell or something, but unless there is an actual market crash I think it's obvious to hold renewable shit until this next bill in Feb. More time before the bill will honestly just drum up more hype the way the markets been behaving

Capital gains taxes, 1031 exchanges, carried interest, increase in corporate tax, LLC visibility, etc.  Green regulations (I'm in favor for) also add to the cost of new construction.  

However, on the other end existing product has seen massive cap rate compression, thereby increasing the value of existing properties.  Cap rates are similar to P/E.  NOI (NCF)/Cap Rate = Price.  The denominator decreases, the price increases.

If you want a fairly descriptive way, first take a look at textbooks for a Geology depts “Economic Geology” course for the last part of the 20^th century’.   Look at a class/text that teaching majors can teach and find a text with plenty of diagrams.  

Helps to know the basics of each machine as engineers can modify (usually with software) even old machinery.   May also help to pick up a basic geology text, know the “rock cycle”, etc   My course included oil and our “lab” (field trip) for that week was a refinery visit that week.  So if you can find a descriptive treatment of oil fractionalization, that’ll help.

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with what we’ve done with GME. I’m referring to all of the comments I’ve seen recently trying to “do a GME” on another small cap stock with high short interest

The governments disregard for understanding of macroeconomics scares me. I get we need stimulus but, we need to cut spending in many places. Both parties just want to grow the government.

IDK I've been selling on ebay, depop, and etsy for 12 years and tried but quickly dipped on Posh. Posmark trash and everything sits on there forever bc they force sellers to use priority mail for everything which makes it twice as expensive than it should be to ship anything lighter than a hoodie... ebay is on it's way down too fwiw.

&#x200B;

tldr: posh trash, ebay trash, etsy bull sort term.
oh god TLRY, I can tell that shit is going to fly like Tesla next year or whenever the dems legalize, will probably start buying in
Depends. Is NSFW bannable? New here.
I remember him saying that he would probably be better off if he never sold anything, and him telling another story of how they sold intel in the late 80s. At the same time, I just fundamentally know these companies aren’t for me (super overvalued companies compared to cash flows like draftkings for example). Wouldn’t it be better to allocate that capital to a few positions I really like instead? Or no because I’m so new?
We sure he still has the puts and they haven't been sold?
It depends on what the deal was. Sometimes it is for a set price, in which case you will get the agreed upon price per share. Other times it will be converted to a certain amount of the other companies stock. 

I think I remember reading that Fitbit agreed to a cash deal. So you will get whatever the agreed upon amount was and your shares will disappear.

Fuck this got me hyped.
But...we actually are causing the short squeeze LMAO
I agree, but let's be sure to give him the benefit of being able to change. Today and yesterday had a completely different tone than the day before that. I hope it continues, we can learn a lot from him, but nobody learns anything if they are insulted by the teacher.
If it does and I sold my weeklies today at a huge loss for no reason I will literally off myself
I'm going deep on FB for earnings. monster levels of ad spend on their platform in q4.
As a surgery chief resident, I salute you and wish I had gotten into this at your age.  Also, will be graduating my MBA debt-free for the same reason as you.

My advice, put some TSLA and PLTR aside and do not touch until you're an attending (at least).  More importantly, don't be a gomer.
>why would anyone play GME is beyond me

Who’s the retard now, retard?
Definitely. Or the tie.
More than that.

It's confusing.

Just as it's confusing to know what my social security benefits will be.

I picked up a letter that arrived to my dad's last year and then forgot it, haha. It seems to predict that I'll get like $500/month or so, but in 2042 (approx.) dollars...and I don't know how it works, like if I get more if the fund does well or get less if it doesn't. 

I remember way back when that it seemed to me that I only would receive benefits for 5 years...but maybe that was saying, "if you pull $X, it will run out in 5 years"?

I don't know.

I'll find out in 20 years!

Like a Christmas present.

Same with social security. When I hit 60 I'll look into it more deeply.

Our plan is to hopefully not need either and have this be gravy.

As stated before, my life is weird.

I also have strange delusions of grandeur - like one day I'll write the Great American Novel and none of this will matter - which is dumb, because I've already written a novel and did not wind up getting it published. My NEXT book will be 10x better though, for a number of reasons, which are too long to type out or talk about without wine, whiskey or beer.
Tell that to the banks that were bailed out on the taxpayer's dime while college education costs ballooned. Many people with legitimate degrees were forced to put their careers, based on legitimate degrees, on hold for half a decade or more while loan interest continued to rack up. Favoring the wealthy with economic policies for the last 20 years is what has exasperated wealth inequality and there's no end in sight as long as people are working off debt.
I was never great at mixing
It depends on how your plan is set up. Probably not that much. Just call the custodian and ask.
Mark also seems keen on turning a mind eye to China's human right violations so he can keep doing business with them.
thinking of selling to more more company based stocks.

GTTLX i;ve only made 3720 profit in a span of 5 years 

JAGLX i;ve made 3261 profit in a span on 5 years

HCAIX i've made a profit of 14,564 in a span of 5 years

Is that considered good in a span of 5 years?
Yes we will honey
Can't buy options, but most platforms you can buy shares. On TOS, you just have to choose EXT as the time so it'll execute during extended hours.
legit not kidding...$500
On the same level of calling a divorce a "conscious uncoupling."
You sure did kiddo go get yourself some more shares and a ice cream cone

Wrong fucking way futures
This is the way
rotation out of gme to bb
Uh, I’m often accused of being an Apple fan boy, so... of course! 


Their yoy holiday App Store sales were over 30% higher.  


Now that increase was not because people spent more on apps.  It’s more likely due to MORE people spending money on apps.  The most big spending happens when people get new devices (they often get gift cards with said devices when the device is a Christmas gift).  


In addition to that, the inventory and channel checks seem to indicate a 40% increase in phone sales.  


In addition to the increased sales, their margins appear to be higher too.  


In addition to increased Q1 sales, we all got a stimulus & every time there’s a stimulus, people buy Apple products (look at apples increased sales during the last stimulus package - they beat forecasts). 


And with talk about an Apple Car, people are giddy about the stock altogether.   


So when they confirm increased sales & increased outlook for the year (that’s the big deal), Apple will shoot to $150 pretty quick.  


In short, GME 🚀 🚀 lol
Do yourself a favor and make a budget (if you haven't already) before you close any doors behind you. You have the cost of groceries, property tax, water, electric, home maintenance, gas, insurance. Price out health care before you step out, too. 

I can only dream if when I am in your position, you've done well, now go fuck yourself!
Your wife’s boyfriend fuck you that hard?

Fucking legend. I'm sorry I ever doubted you.
They'll just close enough stores that they'll absorb whatever increase.
Well it was the same way yesterday, but still, it makes me think that we’re headed up
Yeah hope tmr will open a bit lower to let us get the train and walk together 👫👫👫🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
only one with any sense in this thread.  the company is in an industry where every single competitor absolutely prints money (especially this past year) while BB somehow manages to burn cash doing absolutely nothing.  this company is absolute trash.
Ooooo boy we're likely gonna summon the SEC by accident
Lmao your portfolio went higher than her cholesterol
Not even close. They only have 0.02 delta and 53k OI so 100k shares hedged. GME is so hard to borrow the MMs are hedging a good bit with further otm puts

We already saw the price action from those hedges being unwound when the delta tanked from 0.8
If everyone but the current sell order book diamond handed GME could hit $80 tomorrow easy
Haha whatever you think pal I’m sitting here with gains, are you
Yeah bill is too expensive to include infra
Have you talked to any of the mouth breathers in here that shorted GME *yesterday*?

Welcome & ban
I have the same shit right now it’s a fucking nightmare. Already had 1 surgery but now it’s back a year and a half later
It’s simple, imagine all the additional pressure from the options they minted above 40$ today expiring in the money, on top of all
The other factors.
This thread is almost a month old...

KEEP FUCKING GOING!
GME
You really think GME is going to change the world?  At least a case could be made for Tesla but GME not so much.
Crazy to think about. Bitcoin would be the most valuable currency on Earth if the US experiences hyperinflation in the future. May need to start stocking up haha
Yup. Up till 40. And if retired around 40 (or sooner of course) because of WSB help it's "Forever young" by Alphaville.

Come to think of it I will play this tune, right after Ecstacy of gold once I will get to around $1.3M and retire.
BB is the first time I've ever watched a stock after hours.  


This makes me happy. My calls are gonna print hard af in the morning.
Okay thanks. Insulation the guy didn’t even care. Rough in inspection was a bitch though
I think it’s ok if you check, but don’t beat yourself up if you miss going to the moon because you were taking time off you know?
So you buy ITM calls. How far ITM?.. Just what you can afford?
No one should beat themselves up about missing GME.  People post better DD with good justifications all the time and they flop.  Going all in on something like GME was objectively fucking retarded but it did work out extremely well.  Just saying think before blindly dumping money into shit because of fomo.
> AMD

please sue bae!!! :pray:
Because thats what we are, we are retarded. Don't you think gambling all your life savings on a company, just because some autist on reddit told you so, isn't retarded?

Postitions: $GME 270 shares @18$ 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Ya, it would def be more useful to use forward looking metrics. I just don't have a lot of confidence in forward looking estimates for many of these companies going into 2021. So to be a bit more conservative I like to stick with trailing twelve months.

For me, I try to find companies with a score of under 0.50. I think those companies are very well priced relative to revenue. (assuming they have high gross margins)
Institutions selling those contracts will purchase/sell shares in response to people buying them. Which will then in turn increase share price

Payoff your debt. Put 3-6 months worth of expenses into a savings account for and Emergency Fund. Don't touch it unless you have a real Emergency. Open a ROTH and put in the max for 2021, $6000. Put the rest in some good growth mutual funds. Create a monthly budget that includes you contributing 15% of your income to a retirement plan. Treat yourself to a steak dinner to celebrate being on the path to becoming a millionaire.
Up even more after hours. To the fucking moon!

I don't think so you can try lol
I think it’s a phase out. So if you make like 80k you’ll still get some stimi
but if you're expecting it to increase, why not buy 100 shares of Stock x at $10?  Plz help me im a smooth brain
Super easy. 6in edge nailing, 12in field
Tutes are basically Whack-a-moling market opens and any rallys that begin. Demo day on the 26th and earnings in mid-Feb will make Palantir undeniable. We're pretty much at ground level for PLTR aside from employees. Tutes are holding the bulk of shares from 10 to 20 anyways, ain't going under 20.
What’s the level Short Sellers at GME will shit themselves? $60? $100? 🚀
I already have 2 LEAPs on ICLN that I'm up quite a bit on, and I'm bullish in general.

Even if this doesn't move after Biden's speech today, I'm expecting some movement once he's formally inaugurated and gives more details on his environment and infrastructure plan.
How'd you get that?
decent theory
Enough to replace a salary in the IT field but with half the hours and about a tenth of the stress 

Unless you meant my daughter; in that case she’s down about .26% in after hours so far
1,400 checks confirmed. Biden is gonna talk about it  today
Wonder how many people will use them to buy TSLA shares :p
so when do i load up on GME puts
Did you not see the memes? Buy now
Tim apples ducking auto correction that’s the duck who
the short interest is spiking because the capital groups are counting on this sub losing interest in GME at some point and moving on to something else, at which point the stock will crater and they'll make all the money they're presently losing back - and then some.

&#x200B;

The solution, of course, is to keep our boots on their throats until they give up and eat their shit sandwich.  That's why it pisses me off when people say they "missed" GME like it's over or are talking about cashing out and rolling to something else.  The fucking thing is moving up double digits every day and you want to leave in the middle of the run?
Always were
Holy shit someone in this sub has real talent. Color me green.

Stripe is rumored to be worth $100B at IPO so I’d assume 5% isn’t too bad. Yeah I find that interesting they don’t want to get acquired but they were interested before and they technically didn’t pull out, they were denied

I've still got my shares & Apr calls as well - I'm not letting go of those until GME hits triple digits!

I am doing some shorter term (weeklies & Feb) call debit spreads & bull put spreads to try & scalp some income off the continued rise & volatility, though!

How about you learn about the greeks before you buy options you retard
Yeah, this is actually fucking fire my guy
No problem, so currently yes they have "dealerships" so there are these larger spaces which compose of places for NIO owners to have their children play, coffee shops, they host events for owners like wine tastings etc (This is called a NIO house) , then they have something called a NIO space where you can see them in a mall for example where they will have all their models present, but none of those extra amenities.

They are more expensive but do provide many more luxurious features in comparison to Tesla from what I've heard from owners on the NIO app and YouTube, the attention to detail and the build quality is much better (no shoddy fixes and panel gaps).

They are not vertically integrated however, they have a joint venture with their manufacturing partner and they work together to lower costs, their vehicle margin is currently at 12.5% it was at -12.5% the year prior.

There is significant demand, we should hear about pre orders for the ET7 in the next Q4 call in March and currently they have a 4 month backlog of orders which is roughly 25 000 vehicles. 

NIO operates in a more luxury market compares to tesla, as they provide a lot of custom services, like insurance, roadside charging whenever you need it, battery swaps, superchargers all free of charge and a whole host of other benefits.

Check the r/wallstreetbets literally 4 out 5 posts are about the short squeeze on GME. People are making huge money with options.
Stonks only go up
My personal pt is 30-40 eoy I’m gunna play leap calls and buy dips.
 Bro give me 5k I’ll literally tattoo ur name on my ass
Dont get me wrong i love gme. I love the amount of gme thats on here rn. But I dont like the media coverage. Lots of actual retards and virgin boomers are gonna come to this sub. Every 2nd comment is "I jUsT JOiNed, duRgH i aM GmE GaNg DuRgh"
Just needs an Altemeier. I'll hook him up (pun intended).
I'm low key a bit scared now that everyone on wsb is making mad money
Thoughts on GOEV??
When do we get the ISDA?
Thinking about getting 63$ calls for 1/22 but worried. Thoughts?
Wtf is the S E N S catalyst
I don’t think this plan has anything with the climate change. I believe it will be the next on he’s working on.
Been in and out when it's around mid-40.

Should just hold ENPH for the next 5 years at least
did any of the stocks you own underwent mergers or stock splits?

I have a very high IQ, so I don’t comprehend all this Autist speak. Did the BB 🚀 launch already?
Sucking Every Cock
DFV, CTN, and Ironyman for starters
That’s the same position I was in for IDEx and sold at $1.10 and the next day it went to $3

I’m not making that mistake again
I feel like this is the sleeper for the Pharma side of things. Next paycheck ya boi is going $400 on stocks. After that maybe go for a call in Sep for $6.
dude made a shitload of money in a very short amount of time. he's at 7 million in capital gains. he's going to probably cash out a significant chunk. he will owe at least 20% long term capital gains, but probably some will be short term. so he's gonna owe a lot of taxes.
GME was cool but the cannabis rally has been amazing! ACB is gonna buy me a Tesla and a new game at GMEStop
WUPH
If this gets Cramers attention, faster to the 🌝🌝🌝🌝
Rip let me know how you feel tomorrow
there's no percentages on the moon
350% in 2 months is insane. If it was since like June it would be believable but still high. S&P went up like 170% since the dip in like what late March.
The shorting fee for GME is 45%.
As of writing GME is 42$
If you were to short one million shares today that would cost you almost 52k per day just holding that position......

How many stocks were shorted again?
This.
Also anything leaked to WSB wouldn’t really be insider info anymore. That shit becomes public lol
is it too late to buy it tomorrow? Do you know what is the price target for it? I plan to hold it for a longer time.
Shares tomorrow morning! We’ll walk together 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
And you’re right. ‘Squeeze’ is the new meme word of people just wanting to P&D their bags. GME had a VALID reason(s) for this to happen. An actual catalyst. Just because a random ticker has massive short interest, that doesn’t mean anything. So I agree with you fully
probably autocorrect, boomer

Cheers to this sub. After losing nearly all my money betting against JPOW and his printer back in March, I've started to stage a comeback thanks to GME and APHA. My wife opened my eyes by yelling at me "don't be a gay bear, stonks only go up!" I'm up 70% in the past month and could have had more if I didn't paper hands GME the day before the 🚀🚀🚀. May many more massive shrek dicks be in your future.

If my current TSLA calls print in the next month and give me a bag,, I will roll that whole position into a TSLA farthest OTM 2023 leap. That should still give me 2x leverage I hope on the stock price. And TSLA will win the battle for autonomous vehicles. They will have fully autonomous vehicles that are also the best EVs.
Is this the next move?

How is cash app going to let you trade stonks but NOT FUCKIN GME?! This is a travesty 😂
BB NEXT 🚀
Every fucking day
It’s about to get weird isn’t it
thats ONE way to put it
Funny thing:  BB isn't even in phones anymore.  They sold their patents to China.

&#x200B;

BB is now in enterprise security, particularly connected car.  Which is an amazing space that has a HUGE fucking future.  BB is the Phoenix of Wall Street.
time for WSB to open their own short position like melvin
Imo unlikely bc losing millions down to zero in a position is gonna look real bad for Melvin etc. Cutting losses by covering will always be better.

Hypothetically, if they do let them expire though, there's still the matter of market makers. As mentioned, when they sell puts they balance this bull position by shorting the stock in order to become delta neutral. Significantly less open puts, more open calls = market makers buy more of the stock.
Fuckin sweet lets go bois! We will all be forever young!
Already owned PLTR, yes please.
Legit all of this board got hard when this announcement dropped.
Here’s the thing about infrastructure, you need to tax people to pay for it. How you tax them comes by lots of names but the money doesn’t just appear.

But half the (voting) country is dead set against taxes to pay for things they are demanding. Until we get political leaders at all levels of government (city -> federal) who are willing to raise taxes to pay for infrastructure it will continue to fall apart.

My state DOT is forecasting a 50% shortfall for _maintenance_ expenses in the next 5 years because of partisan anti-tax gridlock. Yet at the same time those anti-tax legislators are demanding increased spending on transit systems.
I was on vacation I’m sorry babe.
Post it on YouTube so I can save it and listen to it while jerking off to my pltr shares
so buy more GME ? got it
It opened today
Fat fucking tendies to be had bro. It's up north of 10.50 from a close of 9.11.
GME BB SPCE APHA
That's the worst part. It's likely to come back again if you don't get it right the first time. It has like a 50% chance of coming back.

The reason is because the law suit form the DOJ. They wanna break up FB for being too big & it might happen.

Stop being poor, hold GME and just buy BB
You killed me with the PLTR part.  I'm half GME half PLTR.  I want to take gme gains and just roll into PLTR leaps.
I got in on the [Micron](https://i.imgur.com/Kz4RnYg.jpg) hype in 2017. Still holding from then. I'd say it's going well.
These 1000c i have r dead to me
XLE i really could choose one oil stock but several of the ones mentioned as good potential bets for this year a listed in this ETF.
Have you taken a look at A M C? Looks like the next GME.
I’m actually so excited for tomorrow. Should be like last week.
tplee for some reason
Someone explain to me why everyone thinks PLTR will have the same journey as GME? Im bullish, but shorts only have like 7% of the float there vs GMEs 100+


Is this just wishful bs, or is there a technical similarity I'm missing?
I really want to see the open position of someone who shorted earlier this year.

Haha thanks I will see what I can do
how about the Plaid IPO theyve been discussing?????
I guess that makes a little more sense, but I doubt they paid the new guy the same as what the old guy was making and they're still saving money overall. I understand that it's a large corporation, but I don't think that's much of an excuse either. They need to start paying up and giving proper raises or people will just leave. Especially if you're in software the number of available jobs (including remote so you could remain in your LCOL area) are significant.

Working with one company for over 13 years seems pretty crazy to me, but if you enjoy the work and make decent enough money to retire soon there's no reason not to stay. I agree it's all about balance I just hate the excuse that because it's a large corporation they can't pay. On the contrary because they're a large corporation and large corporations are raking in the money they should be paying you higher salaries compared to other potential positions.
What happened?
1.	Know that trading options is gambling and be prepared to lose
2.	as much as I hate RobinHood, it’s user friendly and explains how buying or selling calls and puts works.
3.	YouTube if you don’t want to try out RobinHood 
4.	buy GME shares
Warren Buffet owns a lot of shares in it so yes.
Also when would I sell it? At the expiration date? Or when it hits $10. I’m so sorry I’m just tryna learn I’m such a noob
Why buy at open? I honestly don’t know
exactly. Think more like music venues, bars, clubs, etc. Most commercial businesses and restaurants that stream music in ceiling speakers and such do so from a streaming service so they are in effect paying their share (assuming it's a service for businesses).
The clean exit
Hi there!

From what I can tell you've got a great start going on your retirement savings and college savings for the girls. The emergency fund seems solid too. Based on what you've written, I'm assuming you don't have any outstanding credit card debt (if you did, I'd say use the extra cash to pay that down!).

A few thoughts for you:

1. I wouldn't look at your company stock as your emergency fund. Your emergency fund should really be in cash. Stocks are volatile (and options are even more volatile) so you shouldn't look at them as emergency cash.
2. You mention that you have stock options and that they will vest soon. Theoretically, it's best to hold on to the option as long as you can and wait to close to the expiration date before exercising. You can look at these options as your ticket to potential aspirational wealth since you've already done a good job in terms of saving for retirement and college.
3. If you still have cash left over (it was hard for me to follow whether you've got $30k or $80k to invest), I would say -- if you're not sure about what you'd like to spend it on then put it in a 50/50 mix of stock and bond ETFs. If you end up deciding to buy the hot tub -- sell the bond ETFs to fund it. If you end up buying nothing then you'll get the benefit of the return on the stocks+bonds.
4. Putting money into the house -- I think that right now (with all of us in the house more..) putting money into your house for improvements is a great investment. Make the house more liveable/enjoyable and I don't think you'll regret the spend!

Good luck!
Where's the 4000%? Also, look like most of the short is prior to the drop due to their recent announcement. Short % of pool is only like 10% according to yahoo https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SRPT/key-statistics?p=SRPT

If you don’t have data, you have NOTHING. Period.

You cannot use absence of data to claim something. 

And you cannot use small data to extrapolate.

You fail basic logic 101.

Holding that for at least a year or until it's legalized.
It already has, scroll the latest in this thread and there’s a bunch of “I’m new to this what do I do?” already
You ever just crush the market and sit back and think.... “Damn I can’t believe I made this off the internet.”
Last one was the absolute worst. Created a fistula and they needed to basically rip my asshole a new one. Literally. Couldn't sit for weeks.
You do have a few choices, but you didn’t say how long ago you sold the covered calls, what the premium was, if you would like to hold on the stock(s), or are you happy with the return you’ve already made. But if you wanted to keep one or even all 3 of the stocks above you probably can, by rolling your covered calls up and out. An example would be, for ARKK, the Jan 15th 133 call closed at around $12.50 
You could perhaps buy those back tomorrow morning, and sell the Feb 19th 140 call for probably a small credit, or a March 19th 145 call for maybe a slightly larger credit.  Not advice, just a thought. Always nice to be in a profitable position (at this time). And by keeping the stocks, there is always the risk they could go back down in the future.
La di da. Look at big dick money bags over here.

What option should I buy tomorrow at open?
How are all you retards getting the vaccine? You probably should yolo sooner than later. GME GANG 🚀🚀🚀
Congrats, and F U! Deserve for holding for 1.5 years. 

Imo in 2 years prob be back down to $2/share if not bankrupt so I would still say great luck. Very garbage company imo. "Hey kids, want to go to Game Stop" said no-one ever.

I got no viable response. I’ll just upvote and pretend I didn’t read that.
It’s great that you’re growing as an investor. Look at that transition as purely positive and don’t be scared that you’ll know more in the future than you do now and want to reassess again. It’s much better to be outgrowing previous investments than to not be learning anything new. While I’m not a fan of technicals such an approach may help you find good exit points from things you don’t believe in long term

People have been making mad money on here for a long time. A lot of people don’t even post. A lot of them lose their money eventually, but some don’t. The crowd has just been gaining momentum as more and more people trust the DD they read and throw more and more money at it which attracts more people, in a perpetual cycle.

Not a boomer but never in my life have I had autocorrect fucking to "ducking." That's just shit technology.
That’s the thing- the interest will kill them.  SEC doesn’t have to do shit.  


Interest on $5-$15 is way different than interest on $40+ 


Also, when it jumps like this, a lot of people get margin calls.  The price is maintained by people getting called or choosing to cover & give up due to massive losses.
Jpow bent me over so much in March I stopped playing in the market. Now we on some 🚀
The major fuck up is that look at where GME is now. SMH.
I think 50 is when things will start getting interesting
Sometimes I zone out and feel like we’re two days away from some mad max shit, and all I want to do is ride a motorcycle, wield a katana, and eat a ton of edibles. Reading your comment was too relatable
Freshly squeeze orange juice for GME bulls from Melvin's capital
So what?
so the theme of this week is stocks that are super old breaking out and trading at multi-year highs.

What next? Is there still a $ears ticker we can trade??

we got BB and GME... I mean it seems like there should be a few others that fit into that category.
It's like a medical Chewy no? WOOF=Chewy=Cohen=🚀🚀🚀
The problem is that dumb poor people are getting rich and making rich people look dumb. You know some shirts are making calls to their homies in the sec to see if they can make a case for MM that big boys get to do daily.
100%. Sell at open cus you might have doubled. If not just below. Then reinvest in the dip and ride to Tuesday as you said.
They will do a special dividend.
Lool
Yes
You may be young, but that really is some.boomer energy.
I read two DD reports on it today in WSB that sounded promising. I would link them if I weren't on mobile.

I may edit this comment shortly when I hop on my pc with the reports.
bruh i've been chucking tits all lockdown #vapelife
Look for the dd on it, it’s good and I’m waiting till open
This Is Cramerica ... Don't catch you slippin now.
Why did you register an account just to post this?

I'd say that's a pretty good indicator of why moderators are needed here.
Ppl have been posting the same shit for this stock for days. Buyer beware
Cramer pumped the shit out of gme a few moments ago. Tomorrow could actually get insane.
A DINK software engineer couple in the midwest can make 250kish in an area where a massive house costs 300-400k.

In seattle, homes are basically 5x the cost while income isn't even double. Also the taxes are so much higher when your income is at that level.
Nice job bro! I didn’t dip in because I didn’t wanna FOMO/chase. Was too risky. And of course it topped at $8-9 lol
 BYND ... just an experiment

BYND .... Take profits while you can ... Lets go short or buy puts!!! ... BYND not making product for Taco Bell this year ... THEY ARE NOT SELLING IT TO THEM THIS YEAR! THE ANOUNCEMENT WORKED FOR US NOW ITS TIME TO TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN! Thankfully nobody seemed to have really understood the semantics of the announcement. They are simply exploring a new product that will be TESTED in the NEXT YEAR .. this means that their experiment if it goes well may begin selling in 2022.
This is sick dude!! Pltr to moon buying calls at open tmr 🚀🚀🚀
If you bought shares just hold them. If you're new to this then you probably didn't buy an option, because you have to opt in to get the ability to buy them. You might see it dip in the short term but if it's a long term investment, just hold your shares tbh it'll be worth it in a few years
ENPH up decently AH
I hope there’s momentum building up to it
It depends on how you set it. My broker sets a trailing stop limit as a percentage, and then you set a specific selling limit.
Like, "if it falls 10%, sell no less than $X.xx"
Buy now! Will run when it opens and you don't want to miss the tendie train
Whatever happens next week will be better.
Never count your chickens til they hatch; unless you’ve pulled out your position you haven’t made anything yet. That being said I am half ICLN and half GME, but don’t go counting your money yet.
Same bro I had MRSA on my gooch once and the cyst burst in the waiting room. Smelled like rotting tampon.
Don’t worry, if she wants to sell I just switch to paper trading 

(She’s up 420% in that account)
Trading at 10.55:)
I think the calculators and "modest" 7% interest is to keep people in check though. It is likely the past decade will have been a major outlier in hindsight over the next 100 years.

Not his DD, but some other redditor called out a BBBY short squeeze ~2 weeks ago.
Damn son how’d you predict this move? That’s a risky fucking gamble
You wish, GME is jacked up on adderall, coke, nicotine, and Mountain Dew and its not even 9pm yet
Where do you think it’ll be by March
We definitely played coffins back when we were loading bodies in the back of trucks
Puts on robinhood.  Allowing 0DTE purchases up 1.5 hours to close.
🚀🚀🚀
Yeah that’s the way this stock is finally getting the recognition it needs this DD was the reason I bought
do you think the people holding PLTR understand anything about technical similarities or shorts/float
$BB
Interesting stuff. Edibles are the best and the possibility of life is insane
Ah, that's fair, the spread was pretty usable if you went into it planning to swing trade.
One punch man
it's a good long play if you're willing to wait but tbh I don't expect it to moon in one big jump
Was this coined in VWAY?
Love this. Thanks for sharing
King Retard
With financial aid that sounds about right
Huge reward/risk ratio. I’m only risking what I’m willing to lose but if it starts moving up we could potentially see a ten bagger
MODS!
Because I didn't know "naked short selling" was a thing
Bought 14 2/19 am I dumb or
It won’t be, just weird you don’t like money. Donate to charity or sum
so is it worth it? whats the math and what call
better yet, this man has     💎 balls
PLTR stands for People Love The RMoney meaning that the only place it's going is up
Holy mother fuck
100 pennies make a pound. 100 cents barely make a sound - unless you have a hundred thoussssaaand you could play it cool and buy one hundred — but you’ll look a right fool if it becomes the full pound— and your left jabbing zeros into your calculator, scratching your head at why you didn’t just suck it the fuck up and buy 100,000....
Is there some online resource that could teach a complete idiot to understand whatever you just said?
What’s going on with BB?
Ahh gotcha. Stripe is bigger in terms of revenue, in 2019 they had $450M vs ~$100M of Plaid if I recall correctly, so more likely well known (these numbers likely doubled under the pandemic and online purchases sore). 

Personally, I think Plaid is more of a long-term risky disruption play – they have the opportunity to completely disrupt the current payments network system. For example, instead of having to go through card networks, Plaid's technology allows you to withdraw directly from bank accounts. 

Right now, that tech is used to fund Venmo accounts, but could hypothetically be used to buy anything. That's seemingly the main reason Visa wanted to acquire them and why the DOJ blocked the acquisition. There's a ton of opportunity for a disruption that would hurt Visa, and they likely hoped to prevent it by buying them out.  

Stripe is interesting as well but has a lot of similar competitors – Adyen, Square, Paypal, etc. Likely less disruptive than Plaid, but it's hard to predict the future.
Fuck bitches, make money
Fuck you dave! The fucking retard could have had a $3.45 gain today if not for you!

Thanks bud, much better now.
It is always wishful bs.  You can justify almost any play on any stock if you wanted to.  Especially with the standards people here expect - just post gains and say "train still at the station all aboard!".
ICLN to the 🌚
Where can watch
Im kinda retarded so idk what that means
PLTR isn’t a short squeeze play, at least not for me. I’m bullish on them for the long term potential of their company.
Line at food banks increased of 10000%, bullish on food banks.
Just need Plug to get on board now

I joined this group after watching this, got in on $BB yesterday so looking forward to the group. 

Here’s my question: how does he know we’re all young?
$BABA
tesla tomorrow
this is it. look at my reply.
fuck man been there. try super salty hot water on a towel n hold it on it. otherwise u gotta get to the dr or whatever
this is what i asked before fomoing into GME after they went up 60%
Market insider is working
The price data in ToS paper trading is delayed by 15 mins.   
I like to look at real time data and then paper trade like Biff from Back to the Future with the sports almanac.

Just set up a RH account the other day and was genuinely surprised at how easy the bank account integration was. Would love to get in if they decide to go SPAC route. Good write up!

right?
Calls for tmrw? Yes? No?
SHORTS STILL ARENT CLOSING. GET YOUR FUCKING SELL LIMITS TO 69420.69. THOSE BROKERS ARE GONNA FIND US ALL UP THERE. GME TO THE FUCKING MOOOOOOOOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Did that with CRSP because I heard of CRISPR and it sounded cool... and I'm up over 100%... do I sell or just let it ride until we're all getting gene therapy?
this isn't even traded on Robinhood
So WSB of you to invest in an ETF
I only bought 100 shares lol
Try not to look.
Yep and yep! As far as I know, that is.
It’s not the sector in the person, but the person in the sector.

Hey, you won't get her to let you cum inside you, but with all that GME money you're gonna make, you can hire the entire Moonlight Bunny Ranch, and that's even better.

Well done.

TSLA, PSTH, BB, ARKG, PLTR, AAPL, TWLO, & last but not least ☪️☪️♊️♈️

Lawyer:  Straps on helmet.  "Let's do this"
Feel free but all signs point to the squeeze still being on.
GME Shares
If that’s what everyone does then I need to join in but I need to know how far back I would need to set the time to on that website between 6 hours and 7 days
but that requires them to have the shares, right? like they would be naked shorting if they don't have the shares, right? i thought that if you short a stock like this and it's rising like crazy you basically have unlimited loss potential.
It's not about the politics---my favorite part of WSB is its un-shaking commitment to making tendies no matter who's in charge.  Go look at the discord for yourselves, they're like our cancerous cousins, we don't need them.
I made a [video](https://youtu.be/xG-MzErtrpQ) on ARK Invest’s new space exploration ETF and what stocks could possibly be added. The “X” might be a hint if you know what I mean 😉
His name is probably The_Crautist or something like that
idk never got an invite im not cool enough.
What’s your target?
Well done Foreignbro
I like it
You’re right.
On the bottom DFV says, "I can go into greater deal when/if the trade works out" responding to why he entered the trade. 

I can't wait for the last chapter.
Can we just have a Spy up 3% day where all sector moon? then maybe ICLN could actually end green for the day smh
And the answer is no.
Done the math. Just need GME to hit 10,000 by EOD tomorrow and I’m a millionaire. Let’s get it.

Checks out with JPOW saying earlier that labor market recovery will be much sooner than originally expected

'**The economy is facing a long, slow recovery': There are 16 unemployed American workers for every 10 job openings**
Joe Biden do something this is unacceptable!
It's all relative. ABNB is far less volatile than some other things I have been trading and mentioned. For some people, stable is a GIC. For others, it's a mutual fund or an index fund. For others its blue chips.
I don't understand your post. Psec and ARR are the exact opposite of Hormel. Hormel is a company that grows, while psec is a company that is shrinking.

Psec had a $0.40 dividend each quarter in 2008. Now it has $0.06 per month or $0.18 per quarter.
Bought 14 shares at $1.75 and sold them at $1.80
GME
Ooof you’re right. 

Hopefully being here inspires normies to bring out their inner autist
fits the theme!
good  price to buy in. AAPL clearly saw some potential so the stock has a great future ahead
How much were they this morning?
This is excellent, thank you
I'm holding a shit ton of 1/29cs ($125-137 in various quantities). Plan to ditch some in the run up but I have a feeling they'll pop based on all the things I've read about their sales over the past month.
You can’t compare US or Europe to what was happening in Wuhan in Dec/Jan. If we had so many cases then In 2019 then why didn’t we get an outbreak until March?

This is gonna be an amazing gateway to loss porn.
Well some autistic “rapper” inspired me to buy PLTR so I guess that’s the move.

None of us realizes how inefficient the markets really are. I'm sure we've heard this before.  What's the potential halt areas for GME ?  Is that possible?
We just started.
1900 shares at 37.66 its not much but I'm doing my part
I have 2/5 15c I feel very confident this is gonna be a 10 bagger
Can you explain what's the point of Stop Order? https://i.imgur.com/WEEdbh4.png 

If the price is below limit why would you wait for it to go up before buying?
BB 1/15 8c was 3 cent each.  Gonna be $2 each tomorrow.
You're saying a couple days ago these contracts were actually selling for 0.40? I somehow find that hard to believe
I am going to buy a little just to lift you higher tomorrow

This is probably not only financially damaging, but mentally damaging to Melvin.
Shut up dad
Ya, definitely. I think it will be very hard for them to sustain growth like that
Thank you for making me feel better about my massive stake in this company.
who the fuck can just borrow 10k from their parents with no questions asked?
Doubtful. They don't have grounds.
$500 won’t make you any money? Send it to the moon and it will.
GME opens at $46.80 tomorrow and BB opens at $12.40.  Love this alternate matrix we are all running

Now I use IBKR for execution and tradovate for data. Best of both worlds.

I sure hope you’re right. I got XL at $32.9 😓 holding in hopes I can recoup that soon
what makes you say that? isn't still a retail store? Can they compete with chewy online?
Yea that's real bad. But hopefully you learned a lot.
Is there anything big and not obvious one should do if they expect to never marry for building up their savings and investments? Not against the idea or looking to start any arguments that might get this deleted or get me banned. Who knows, maybe it'll happen, but I haven't had great luck and currently it seems unlikely. And the vast majority of information from tax rates to descriptions of strategies, always looks at married rates (and often 2 kids, the "average" family). My whole reasoning behind pursuing FI is out of security (mainly being able to maintain a reasonable quality of life without undue sacrifice such as being forced to work extremely long hours or relocate to somewhere undesirable in order to not run out of money if my career falls apart for whatever reason) , so planning for the worse outcomes and what they could mean to my strategy is important. Hitting a specific retirement date is not important to me at the moment, but not ending up like the scores of people my parents age who were fighting 16 year old me for minimum wage jobs in 2008 is vital. As is not being forced to leave the mountain west while I'm still physically fit enough to enjoy the various outdoor recreation activities I love. It seems some things are significantly diminished if single, particularly tax advantages. Things like tax rates, standard deduction and how they relate to things like the Roth conversion for example. While expenses do not double for two people, since housing and utilities will be very similar,  and the more frugal may go with a single car and other shared resources as well. Is there anything else less obvious i might not know about that should be looked at? So far I've been investing entirely in tax advantaged accounts via HSA,  traditional 401k, Roth IRA, and megabackdoor Roth. I do not make enough money to max out the megabackdoor but everything else I do max. And I own a small townhouse with about 100k in equity thanks to rapidly increasing prices here. And no taxable investment accounts of any kind.
XL- primed for reversal and then major breakthrough. Expecting $24+ tomorrow and close to $30 next week or two before earnings.
The fucking calls were so expensive this afternoon that I just bought shares.  Let's rock
Oh because then Melvin can't 'buy' those back...
That man is one of a kind. He must have already been set with money to not care about the loss potential.
Right here, they won't be able to do jackshit.
New sub time
Epic information. What is the math for how you got to $0.06 per day per share?

thoughts on APHA ?

That might be true. But then you would need to roll your positions at certain intervals right? How often do you need to reset?
What platform do u use to day trade? And how many hours before market open do u generally start analyzing stocks?
GME where the fuck are u going back up to $43 please
lol, I passed out because my infection became severe. Sweating bullets and was in the hospital for 5 days because of badly infected it was.

I will hold my calls until 3:58PM tmr so let's see if I can still cum.
Their lawyers might ask for payment in the GME stocks they had to buy for cover.

So you think the median active investing participant on this subreddit is running between $4.6k and $5.8k of notional? Bc of all the option buying I see here it's probably safe to say many are levered, so maybe 1/10 of that is the ulnevered number -- ~$500... yeah that actually seems reasonable but I'm not sure how many of you are using options vs holding outright -- I suspect the less active participants are not familiar enough to be trading options?
“Social Media company claims victory”

Yup, we’ll be claiming A LOT of victories in 2021. GME is just the start.

* Contrary to popular belief, most Ski/board instructors are not highly skilled skiers or boarders.  At least 3 of the new hires had to Ski pizza down a green run. 
* 96% of lessons are first time lessons.  The expectation is you will go up the lift once. 
* The pay is bad.  You see numbers like $18/hr to $26/hr and it looks nice.  In reality, you wake up before the sun, drive up to the mountain, are only paid when you teach and the max you work is 4-5 hours. You are back home past 5pm. Oh and the best part is you may not get a lesson and may not make any money for the day. 
* When you are not teaching there is limited time to Ski on your own. Most instructors simply never get out. 
* There is a significant $ to get to the ski resort.  You need a 4WD vehicle on a regular basis and you go up significantly in elevation.  This eats at your net income.

I can go on, but I think you get the point.  If you are an instructor for several years, then you will get favoritism and things are significantly nicer but never great.
So FCEL is a pile of garbage again?
So what's the long term play here? Is GME worth holding for a year or more?
What is it normally?

VTSAX and VITAX with VTCLX in a taxable account (although if I had to do it over again I’d just keep it simple and forget VTCLX).  When I want to pivot slightly to bonds, I plan on VBTLX.

Now, all of this said, my primary net worth growth source is my business, not my investments, which are really just my backup plan and a way to diversify myself beyond putting every dollar in my business.  Matching market historical returns or even undershooting a bit that in a long term funk will still work for me.
Ah, I wasn't aware of either of those things. Ok, thanks. :)

Basically you got no idea what’s going on. Neither do we but we see numbers get  higher, higher number good.
Don't sell. Markets are closed monday

Sorry, I was a bit sarcastic... sometimes I do it if their research appear legit but you have to be careful.
dude you have to be absolutely joking me. everyone has known about this transition for a long ass time now.  and if you were an actual investor that took the time to follow these companies then you listened to their last earnings call where they admitted they are literally lighting money on fire while every single competitor is printing tendies. i hope you guys can pump it - i really do.  but the stock is absolute F-tier dumpster fire garbage.
My 10 c hope so
Totally new to trading, since the market is down should I put in a market order for market open tomorrow or is that too risky?

I agree. This is far more than \*just\* a President Biden play. This is also a momentum play based on the entire sector gaining ground. People and municipalities are going green because that's the thing to do these days. They're buying fuel cell based buses, getting solar panels installed everywhere they can, switching to green energy alternatives, installing electric bike sharing, etc. You also have companies like BLNK getting global investment like with South Korea investing 1.5 billion dollars into them just a week or two ago.

&#x200B;

That's also part of why I think ICLN is a good choice. Because its holdings are not actually majority US companies, it has companies all over the world. Clean energy is becoming a worldwide movement due to concerns over the environment, and I believe that will be reflected in the stocks.

Keep pushing TLRY
Me too... So I can buy the dip! 😎
This one is going to hurt for a while. I loaded up on $25c all the way down until last Friday, but then I couldn't stand it any longer and sold them for a couple hundred dollars. They would have now been worth almost $2k a piece. In hindsight, they were worth so little I should have just held and let them ride anyway. I feel so bad.
I have shares. I think I will.
Nah fuck it. I’m yolo all in for the first time starting a couple days ago. Massive gains. There’s still time to hop on the tendie train, it’s gonna take a while for this to burn out
I was just in the kitchen eating soup thinking "That wasn't very hard, it's not like I am skilled."
Yeah I just checked, Tesla's market cap was even larger than PLTR's current market cap at the start of 2020, and that didn't do a damn thing to stop it from mooning the whole year...
Thats a lie lol. 500 to 10k yesterday maybe but definitely not today.
CRTX is worth doing DD on. I think it's going to boom soon.
Freakin pot stonks, going up AH after I sold my calls ...
Nice, those are gonna print so much.
WSB correctly predicted what appears to be a short squeeze. I think majority of people believe it will continue up at least for the next few days, as people shorting GME are forced to cover their positions. It's speculation, but seems more sure than most WSB meme stocks. Good luck to you.

Where do you guys watch after hours ??

Damn TSLA recall
They took one quote directly from WSB that makes us look so much worse imo than if they had quoted any of us saying our girlfriends get fucked by dudes while we watch and check robinhood. They quoted us saying "we run the markets now."
that's certainly disappointing. 

following rubio's letter, one would have hoped biden would respond with a sincere effort to deliver stimulus to the american people. instead, biden just showed he's more interested in soundbites than actually getting something done.

he's putting non-stimulus related partisan poison pills in there like a $15 minimum wage. this bill will be as dead as the heroes act.
Is there a dictionary for all the lingo used here?
Are you taking about wsb elite? I was invited there and it’s really dead over there
How do you open that option
It's gone up 1000% in like four months. What more do you want?
How do I delete someone else’s comment
I’m curious how much influence,if any, WSB had on BB today. Coincidence that people were shilling BB yesterday and it popped over 20%?
Serious question plz. Does volume play a role in the short squeeze because people have been saying iti will last a week based on 6 million volume. Yesterday was 100 million. Serious question and I'm not melvin I'm retarded.
Hey everyone check out the new guy 😂
If my puts aren’t murdered by tomorrow morning, I will never be a bear again

This is the answer you’re looking for if you’re serious.
BRO, are you trolling or do you really not realize whats possible here? I see this to often, we are going to 100 absolute fucking minimum, we could see 500 on this. I'll tell you how you can tell if the short squeeze is over, if you see a day that involves multiple circuit breakers on the way up thats when it has started
WSJ is trash.
It's not, but companies measure losses on potential gains all the time. If you apply that same logic, then the bottom 90% of American has lost 50 trillion to the top 1% over the past 50 years.

Nicely done. For a minute there I thought I was actually watching the real show. Talent is pouring out of ya. Here's hoping my call makes it to ITM.
Burry was right about GME all along. Does that mean we short TSLA
Tesla really just shit the bed this week. Sorry elon, I’m out
So why is GME going to moon tomorrow because of the puts expiring? People exercising?
i'll sell one share just for the screenshot, then buy it back immediately
For what I looked up. They are not the first publicly traded PBC. Just first to transition to PBC while being publicly traded. Correct me if I am wrong.

My thoughts are they will be an initial drawback on the stock as we can has already started. But I don’t believe it will vastly change VEEV’s growth prospects much. The stock will prob stabilize again after a while. 

This will help draw ESG investors I think. It may lose some investors. Not totally sure.

Since this is a long term hold for me, I will prob look to add more as it drops a little.
Because of iv... Mornings tend to have high iv especially as the stock is pointing straight up lol

Someone called in and asked about Ballard. Cramer said he is PLUG guy, and he knows that it went down today because someone said something negative but Cramer thinks that person is mistaken

Hello. I have heard from a television host that I can get good investment advice in this reddit site. Now I thought I had been investing for 40 years until I retired, as I was depositing my savings into my brokerage account. I thought it was a managed account, but it turns out I should have been selecting the stocks to buy the whole time. Now I have this cash which is not invested in anything, I think about $4 million. I would like to invest and I was thinking perhaps coca cola or sears. What would you advise me to invest in? Thank you.

I don't want to be THAT guy, but please pay back that loan ASAP. I'm not saying you're about to lose everything but shit happens and you don't want an outstanding loan under your name that you can't pay back. Especially if you're about to get a bigger loan (the mortgage).
Maybe limited risk was unclear. I want some, just less than weeklys/monthly’s haha

I keep seeing people say the squeeze hasn’t even started yet. How can this be true? What is someone’s price target who thinks it hasn’t started yet? 80? This might sound argumentative but I’m genuinely curious

That's how I feel about Social Security.  I'll be eligible for something but its supposed to be reduced by the Windfall Elimination Provision because, for most of my professional life, I contributed to a pension that doesn't deduct for Social Security.  BUT recently, I read that Biden wants to get rid of the WEP.  So who knows?  I might be sumthin' or I might get nuthin', but I'm not counting on it.

because you might think that it is going to break out and run up if it hits a price. if something is in a range say 100 - 110, you might set a stop at 115, so that if it breaks out of the 100 - 110 channel you can catch that run

Not really. BB has been shilled for months
Hey I appreciate that man, odd to see that kind of kindness around here. I can't complain too much I suppose because really I'm only down $600. Initially I put in 900, made 6k, and got way too cocky Friday on tsla and now I have 300 lmao. Just blows to think I made enough to pay off a fair bit of debt and then lost it within this week because I was too hopeful and didn't want to take a 2k loss so I let it ride until it was almost worthless

Oh fuck yeah that’s the next wave I guarantee it

Well darn, artists would definitely love that. 

I’ve added it to my watchlist.  If anything I think it will take off once we open things back up again so hopefully later this year. Do you know when they plan to launch those 450 Soundstr units?

Nah you still leave yourself some play money.  Like a mil.  With that you don’t need to make stupid moves to make good money.  10% trade gives you 100k.  Buy shares of anything now and you have 10% within months, maybe days.

From what I understand as long as you can cover you don’t need to close your positions and can theoretically wait it out. You just get wrecked by premiums etc. the higher the price goes however, obviously the more pressure. You need to have DEEP pockets to hold out. I think when the first big short gets margin called, there might be a feedback loop jolting things higher and higher
Based on your username alone. I'm out.
Yeah everyone in here should have calls on c o i n  stocks. Got some on the dip
It's not what I think.  It's what an entire team of actuaries and number nerds think, plus a couple of supercomputers that crunched months of data from the sub.  

Note I said the average is between those numbers.  The median could be anywhere on the map.
Thx

Let’s see.. chewy is worth 46 billion and does 7 billion revenue. Woof is worth 6 billion and does 5 billion revenue. I get the fact that petco needs to do online and delivery way better like chewy, but I think this guy still has a lot of room to run. Plus, it’s less than $30 and rh retards live a cheap ipo. Without even knowing what it does they will pump it up to $50.

GME is why people say the stock market is detached from reality. I don't even know how the company is still in business, but you guys have been pumping it for weeks now and somehow you've proved yourselves right. Jesus this market is more retarded than all of you.

ive never bought stocks before ever in my life and i have $110,000 saved up to play with. I'm seeing people say GME but even if it goes from $42 to $80, that doesn't seem like a bigger gain than buying BB which is at $10.62.   


Should I go all in on BB?  
Also, what are taxes like for this? Taxes are only on the profit?

It's just not helpful. Yes, could've done better with indexes, yes, indexing is the new zeitgeist. It's just not useful to be the 10 millionth person saying 'indexes good'. The gates example is obviously just pointing out that doing better in an index is not in itself an end if you have other motivations. A great deal of people failing at trading is not understanding what they're doing and not taking the time to learn. The guy was just sharing that he'd done so. But yes, indexes yadda yadda.

Losing money in the stock market is so 2019.
Because if you draw the lines just right they will tell you to only buy at x price for the break out. Then you'd probably set your take profit in the same order.
google what is a short squeeze. that will answer your question.
There will be another. There always is. Patience. Keep some powder dry next time says Cathie.
ARKG AH 🚀🚀🚀😩😩😩
Oh lord is it happening again?
So is this a scheme to just take advantage of the short squeeze or is it also a bet on the company reinventing themselves and being worth the new price?

Like, is it going to drop like a rock after the squeeze or will it still settle at a higher valuation post-squeeze?
Nah he's woke
Good luck fam!!!

Did you ever hear the tragedy of u/analfarmer2 the unwise? I thought not.  It's not a story boomers would tell you. It's a WSB legend.  u/analfarmer2 was a WSB God, so powerful and so wise he could create 700k in a week. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was not seeing a mil in his account, which eventually, of course he lost. Unfortunately, he YOLO'd his remaining balance on $WEED stocks, his calls expiring worthless.  Ironic, he could bring laughter to others, but not himself.

Hey you want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money FRIENDS.
The period is the little dot at the end of the sentence. I call it a full stop. You don't need three.

I agree, you cannot use absence of data to claim something. That has been the core point all the way through. I'm glad you got there and hope you won't do it again.

I don't know why you're now talking about extrapolating from small data(sets) but, OK. I agree with that too.

I'm so glad we found common ground after all the hostility earlier!

It's very narrow form of globalisation of economy, where labour capital has seen virtually 0 globalisation, while corporate capital has seen huge globalisation. This results in corporations being able to exploit labour that is captured by states. Modern globalisation is in effect the destruction of the free labour market.

Again, high IQ. Are you suggesting buying individual shares? Can you even do that on Robinhood? I can call my Schwab broker, working out of his boomer retirement home, but I don’t know how reliable his dial-up is.
While this sounds great, I have a feeling unemployment will increase and more small businesses will close. $15 an hour more than doubles current labor costs. 

Additionally, the cost of living will increase at least the same percentage. 

Both of those things have happened every time the fed raised minimum wage.
From my experience all paint tastes the same pretty much

Can someone marginally less retarded to me explain why Mevlin's puts expiring matters? Can't they just... Not exercise them? They lose the premium and... that's it. Not I realize that ***obviously*** something else is going on. Something about a margin call. They borrowed money from the broker to... not buy stocks yet? Or something? I'm missing something critical. What is Melvin's responsibility to buy back stocks at all?

Great data

I did a similar experiment but less extensive and detailed. I used the trending stock website to invest in 2-3stocks a day. Made really nice profit on CLWD (160%), and IONI (120%). The difference is that I sold it all. Both of these were extremely well-timed (almost lucky exits, as both dipped hard)

On the other hand I am even on $TLSS (plan to hold after today's dip), after being 100% (I did a mistake not to sell after the hip), and doing pretty bad with $OZSC. Overall about 30% profit in a few day. No complaints.

However, I am new to day-trading and penny stocks, so still learning.  

Will use this thread to thank all the people contributing here.

I have been setting it for 48 hours. Since I have purchased nearly all of the top 15, I catch some that have already spiked, ZOM, CTRM, but at the very bottom, I picked up MGTI, EMBI, and IONI which have made decent gains.
Yes
I agree with your sentiment here. That said throwing it all into tech certainly isn’t the answer either. I have Apple, Intel, and several others so I definitely have tech exposure (you have to right?!?). I just think that there’s a decent chance with the new administration that weed stocks are going to run.  Think about it as “high”-versification.
Could you elaborate, please?

I plan to sell at open, after hoping for another AH/pre-market pump. They were about 100% up at the end of the day. I’m not risking holding throughout the last day. I couldn’t find IV data, but I assume it’s >200% and I didn’t think they would get crushed over night.
I'm picking up on some of it but I'm a pleab

Yeah, this is “napkin math” but I took the published 45.2% interest rate divided by 365 days in a year x the after hours price of $42 = $0.05something & rounded up (because all banking institutions round up when calculating what fee to charge you)
I had 10 contracts that expired last Friday. Would have been 15k if it was this week. I also sold a $19.50 covered call the day before the explosion and woke up late. I am hurt to say the least. Congrats on the gains.
I just want to sell at $420.69 because it would be hilarious and I will be rich but ill toss a small sell order at $694.20 as well

I really wish they would quit pushing "Biden's 2K stimulus checks" when in reality it's for a $1400, because the $600 was a Trump plan. I have a feeling people that don't pay close attention are going to be pissed when the amount isn't the 2K they were expecting.

While I am looking forward to my check, I do find his handling of small business relief to be racist and despicable. In the CNN piece I read, he is prioritizing minority owned businesses. If the money runs out, tough shit Whitey, you should have been born with a different skin tone.

This is pretty impressive. I initially thought your methodology meant you'd be buying stocks that have already been pumped, but it looks like you're doing well on this. Looks like a Reddit pennystocks index fund might be a good idea.
It’s worth 2 billion right now. If weed is legalized, that’s a multi trillion industry. Anheiser Busch is worth 130 billion as we speak and margins on weed are wayyy better than beer. I get that we are 5 years away from actual weed shops being owned by a franchise, but this market runs on hope and future outlook. 

Therefor, my conservative estimate for year end for tilray is 100-130$. That’s if we keep getting legalization news and no one details that.

Dang, that's great!

My fav is always the accounts that you (for one reason or another) stop contributing to, and you can just see them grow.  When I moved to the USA I had to stop contributing to my Canadian retirement account, but I still have it so I get to just see it grow.  I only ever contributed $78k but it's now worth $160k.  That whole thing about investments doubling roughly every 7 years.  It's real.

On my net worth spreadsheet I keep track of the total cash I've contributed to each of my investment accounts so I can always compare the total investment to the total value.  It's a totally optional step, but I like it.  It's crazy how much you start to gain eventually just from market gains in a good year.  (Let's not talk about the bad years though!)

yep to the moon!
id say more in disbelief how its unfolding
Just a little perspective.. Ryan Cohen built Chewy from scratch.  It has a market cap of 47B today.  

And now...
He gets to start with a product that is more popular then fucking pet food.  He gets to start in an industry that is bigger then fucking pet food.  He gets to start with a company that already had $6B in sales last year.  He gets to start with branding that everyone knows. 
 He gets to start with a company that has a market cap of 1B but should be 10B.  He gets to start with 55 million Power Up members.  He gets to start with a company that already has an ecommerce presence.  

How much are shares worth if the company has a 10B market cap? ~$140 per share.

How much are shares worth if the company has a 47B market cap?  ~$670 per share.

TLDR: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Position - 8k shares @ 20.50
I hope someone explains this
He might legalise marijuana everywhere.
🌈 🐻 says what? Don’t sell till $420.69
GME will be full on e-commerce supplying any type of electronics imaginable, probably will add great tech support as customer service is what Ryan Cohen really values, it will truly be the Amazon of electronics at this time next year and you’ll be sitting on 50k from this accidental purchase

3. Being able to move to a LoC living area without being worried about the wages there
4. Being able to pursue areas that interest me, where I don't currently have the energy to do.

Some of the areas in #4 may involve getting some salary, but I don't want to depend on it. For instance, I really enjoy woodworking, but I don't currently have enough space to do so. Even if I did, I'm not sure I would have the spare energy do exercise this hobby much. Maybe in the future I will sell some of the furniture I build, but I don't expect this to get much income.

I also enjoy coding & game development. I ended up working outside of game dev because it is a huge grind compared to other software jobs, but I'd love to develop some indie game myself (or with a few partners).

Other then that, I'd love to volunteer teaching Math & Programming to kids. Maybe this would be a paid position, but the beauty of FI is that it doesn't have to.

Working in RE is a very interesting proposition, because even a low salary makes a huge difference when it comes to the amount of extra money you have. Even a low salary like $10 an hour, 20 hours per week adds up to about $10k a year. When all your regular expenses are taken care of by your nest egg, an extra 10k buys a lot of extra gadgets. You just have to be careful not to let your lifestyle inflate to the point where you \*need\* that extra 10k
is there no point buying tomorrow then?
NOKIA!!!!!
It’s not at the station at all. There are still so many positions to be covered.
yes
They had too many stores. They are closing unprofitable stores which means they stop losing money. The stores that are profitable do pretty well. They are also shifting to better e-commerce sales. Overall the company is growing now.
Guys fuck off with Cramer why cant we win discreetly. Mainstream attn is gna get us banned
Been fine ever since tho knock on 🪵

thought say you autists?
I'm a gamer on a budget looking for a decent used Ps2
In the same boat as you, king. Going to be watching it like a hawk tomorrow, and try and take profits while not being too greedy.
I mean passing out because of an infection seems pretty severe. They assumed what I had was mild until they did an X-ray.
Thanks bro. I'll prob go this route next time. Some people suggested Ark funds so that's prob the go.

Right now my quality of lifes gone up a lot. It's a lot better to not be checking the markets all the time and finding a play. I think i'll also be glad to be back though.
Yeah and that would basically ban them from trading in the US right? But would that effect Tencent in their company shares in US companies?
For example Tencent owns Riot Games, would the blacklist effect that in anyway?
>	problem is, the US is behind on vaccines and has messed up numbers due to doctors taking time off over christmas. 

You have a source for this statement? This is the silliest thing I’ve read on the internet today. I work in healthcare, and doctors and other workers work more now than the years before.

anyone have any opinions as to how current socio-political tensions could affect this market? (i.e we've been in the green for quite a while, stimulus is in process, but will Wednesday lead to a dip?)
Fortunately, there aren’t many shares left to borrow... so they’ll have less and less to work worth... and less to stop it from going up

Listen Cramer I care a lot about social issues but they dont make me any money
Been there, highly recommend it

Also, I thought you were actually endorsing the $55 calls, but I gues you thought 1/29 or 2/19, or later.
WOOF?
Come to gme
Damn it Cramer even Elon made his presence known.  All we need is a sign.

Oh for sure but I'm addressing the second part of the OP where they say they only have 15 shares. I think that's a lot closer to the average than people are led to believe from the YOLO hits here.
Go sears
You just wait until they put TSLA *into* the S&P 500
15% below current values
This GME run is for all of us getting shafted by them for getting shit trade in value our entire childhood
This post is like a time machine to a crypto sub on December 2017.

$DASH: loses money and only had $2B in revs

$FDX: $8B EBITDA, $74B revs, will have record hauls this next quarter due to stay at home black friday and Xmas, and oh yeah FDX is critical for covid vax distribution. 


Yet $DASH market cap = $FDX market cap. Makes total sense.  


Damn, FDX would be $1000+ a share of got a stupid multiple like $DASH.
This is the way
General answer, another lost soul.
Haven't put any on yet. It just hit it's ATH like an hour ago after close bud.
WSB must own a majority stake in GME by now lol
Not until feb when he announces his infrastructure plan.  Not a bad thing, more time for me to buy into ICLN!
agree it is a lot for me.  just see some really crazy gains here and didn't want to be clickbait.
Bro we’re gonna wake up to 45
Thanks for the info!
You make money.

It's the hogs...

Quality comment
Dude I swear I think TSLA is just fuckin up all metrics. The amount of volume in both shares and call options in TSLA alone is eclipsing ETFs across the board. 

I wish I could subtract TSLA from SPY/VOLD
Not sure how to answer that one
good thing about r/wsb is that most boomers will see the sub for the first time, looking for trading information as described by Cramer but only see memes, movie-edit gifs, and lots of talks about diamond dicks, hands, autism, a lot of love triangles with boyfriends fucking wives and leave the site, thinking they had a typo. That's how they end up in r/stocks eventually
Lmao those would of been worth 1800% today.
Great picks. Stick with them. Although I also like crowdstrike as the other guy mentioned. I wouldn’t touch pton at this level though
Take the boomer money. TAKE IT.
How long does it take for shared to be released? Day of sounds fucky

What about his chipmunks?
Already talked.  Just mumbled about GME while fumbling with his Blackberry
Dude you’re about to lose all your money man... You don’t even know what market cap is smh. Here’s a rip that might save you, everyone is shilling BB and GME because they’re in it. They have money to make if retards like you buy a lot of shares. But these will come back down soon enough, there’s a lot of better stuff to invest in that won’t bankrupt you. Don’t follow the memes when they already doubled.
LOLOL
The percentage is the same!
Pls bby. And TSLA
I’m here to get my Biden stimmy news
I wouldn’t doubt hitting 50 tomorrow

AMD re-entered the server market 3.5+ years ago. For 1.5 years AMD has absolutely annihilated Intel in the server space in performance, efficiency and cost, and it's mostly a drop in replacement for Intel. Market share is still just a touch over 10%, and expected to take at least another year to hit 20%.

Sure AMD can go from mostly irrelevant to a small but significant amount in a couple years, but to suggest that they're realistically going to challenge Nvidia in that space in the next 4 years in terms of market share is super premature.

I bought $500 worth of GME shares for luls and to help out. Even if the stock went up to 80 I would make like $80. Considering how much I have it would be like Warren Buffet dropping 50 million for luls and to help out internet strangers. Crazy.
Im right here 👋🏻
They do now. New update
bought 2 at 3:59 at 0.52 lol.  Doesn't even have to hit 55 to go green
I agree 🌚
yes
This is a casino Sir
Bought at 0.11 again. Recovered a bit and still up about 15%. Anyone have any predictions for tomorrow ? I don’t have a fucking clue what I’m doing.
🤡
Of course also holding large GME gains still
My biggest runner today by far!! Holding this one no matter what.
Many stocks in that industry are going up with the idea of Biden's speech today, and him being more progressive with thinks like weed etc.
Lol you’ll see. Don’t worry. I’m green and fine. So will everyone else. Stop being mad cause you didn’t get in early to make moreenjoy

Ohhh shoot my bad I read ur comment wrong my man, no they won’t, make sure they don’t go through on market open or they were limit orders I assume
I guess that's fair. Technically, they were sued by the DOJ, but Visa said they were going to challenge it. After discussions internally and with Plaid, they decided to just drop the acquisition given the complex court process. 

I've read that after seeing these huge tech IPOs and SPACs, Plaid's investors and management may have seen the $5B as not as much as it could be and additionally pressured Visa to drop the challenge.
That is real beautiful
GM + E are the two to hold, also GME

Good long-term bet too. Buy at open. It'll probably squeeze for a bit and then stabilize. So you can decide to go for short-term of you fancy it too. Cohen is at the helm so with any luck there'll be consistent growth over the next while.
Prodigal son is back baby. You're right this thing still has a lot more juice.

This idiot has $44 2/19... the way shit goes parabolic nowadays why not.  But yeah.  It’s not working out so far.
Why BRK and not an index? I like the idea of BRK, but even Buffett seems like he'd recommend just going with the S&P 500.
Facebook’s market cap is at 700 billion and twitter only at 37 billion. It should say, facebook lost about 49 billion and twitter 2billion. Which are both less than 10% of their total marker value. This is misleading, they just had couple bad trading days. Stfu
Maybe leap puts and day trade the squeeze if so.

You will either get 50% gains or you lose 50% gains if you buy GME or BB.

Gonna PLTR and see if this shit talking actually works. Anyone know which way the pointy end and firey ends go?
why did GME FADE SO MUCH AH
Mid Feb to be safe, going for 1.80 right now
I’m a little retarded but I think it’s basically everyone buying their call strike prices? So basically it’s a feedback loop with everyone buying their calls @ 55 and shorts trying to cover. Would make the stock go absolutely parabolic for a short about of time
Pretty much. Dems will control house/senate so unless one dem senator objects with some bullshit to get more $$$ or a rider from his constituents it should be quick and easy.
I bought two calls so far starting at 250 and 260! Will go all the way up to 300 if it starts printing
this sub has lowered my IQ by the same proportion its boosted my returns. 

fuck me, i caved and bought AH.
They already jumped from 80 to 120 in the last few months. But yea, definitely a great company, i have some shares in my boring boomer account.
Here’s the way I look at it using OP’s numbers.

If you are holding quality stocks (not some penny stock, meme, pump and dump shit) you could lose 25% of that portfolio and still be up over 50% since last March!! Incredible gains even after losing 25% from today’s prices.
1rony man
BB BABY
its being shilled SO hard.  what could go wrong?
What option should I buy?
!Remind me 73 days
Hello sir, I'm sorry to hear that! 

Basically, IANASB, but you want to concentrate on buying 5 year puts on green energy, space travel and robotics. These fad industries are bound to crumble - going the way of the cursed adding machine, and the short-lived Tamagotchi! You'll be able to retire to a castle, or even buy as many rooves as you want!
BB will be your stronger bet if you're holding longer than 2 weeks (10 years, I see it at least x10), but we don't do that here.
Yeah he missed the point. He sees us pump ICLN and Tesla and thinks it’s cuz we care about the environment
Fuck it time to ride this 🚀 to the mf moooooooon
Should I just buy CRISPR shares and quite stressing over options?
Have you heard of "video games"? It's just like television except you can control the people on the screen. It's gonna be big. Right now the major seller of these "video games" is a chain of stores called GameStop, you know, a place where you can "stop" in and see all the new games in one place. I have been following the news related to this company and I am very confident that it will be a good long-term investment. The best part is, you only have to buy this one stock and not worry about checking on multiple different companies. I believe, if you act quickly, that your initial $4 million dollar investment could be with 8, 12, or even 20 million within a few years. Don't wait, this opportunity won't be around forever. If you need assistance opening a Robinhood account, just ask anyone in this group. They'll be happy to help you. Good luck friend!

the funniest part about BB is i havent played the market in months and woke up and decided to buy 1/22 8.50 C at open cuz i was bored at work
Potential to secure partnerships with other companies which will be huge for them. Personally I really like their concept and think there's enough innovation for them to grow quite a bit. I'm gonna hold for a year probably
BB is your chance at redemption child.  Consume the berry.
$20
that’s a lot of B’s my B
IS BBBY still a buy on Friday?
WSB has become my new DD so why the fuck not!
Shouldve waited until earnings in Feb retard
Here
I bought 50 of the 12$c 1/22  just in case they wanna do EV
At this point does it matter?  We literally can't be more leveraged.  Who's gonna stop them long as the dollar still means something.
Lmao right there with you brother. Not down on my calls or shares yet but it would be nice to see some movement
They’re driving me fuckin’ nuts over here chief. I gotta get rid of these fruitcakes.
DBVT (DBV Technologies) just got great FDA news. About to explode in next 6 months. Already up 75% after hours. Going to $25
I got in right when i posted that.   Close to $29 after hours.   This is looking good.
da fuck u talkin about retard
I’m the only retard pumping PENN. Feels bad man.
Not gonna lie I’m feeling super depressed I’ve only had 200 shares of gme this entire time. 

Could have turned my entire 100k savings into what? 2 mil?
Ya I don't think this is going to end well
F
yea that motherfucker wears a helmet to bed
Nah, scalped in the morning off a small swing. Thought it would fade but then it didn't.. map here we are xD jumped back in.
If it goes up to 80 that’s almost double what it is now, you would make $500
Why not green energy?
Well enough to make you hold when you really should sell
booyah!
NIO can you fucking fly again, im regretting so hard to put my money in NIO and not GME
I would start turning a profit tbh
I made a good amount today, now my brother wants to give me 1k to play. What do I even do?
gonna try to jump on BB in the morning. Shares? or like a $15 call. both probably 🤷🏻‍♂️
Ok
Got u player.
Sorry to butt in from the front page. 

Is this whole thread an elaborate joke filled with sarcasm, or is this really a representation of an average “hobby stock investor”?
Nah
Damn CNK is ramping tf up.
If the market doesn't pump over MLK weekend from this upcoming stimmy talk, then what has all this been for? What have we really accomplished electing this man
I guess it pays to comb over hundreds of comments. But seriously, I wish i saw this. Props dude

Ok look at Best Buy for an equivalent evaluation then.  B&M does not, a company, destroy.  You can have physical locations and strong e-commerce and kill the game, speaking of which GAMING is such a huge market with so much upside in its own right
Love AMD and want all the best for em but TSMC not being able to meet demand for them is bad news for that needed growth(and a price much beyond 100)...intel having fabs makes meeting demand and much higher profit per (inferior) chip is a major headwind.  And if the new Intel CEO corrects the ships and starts producing superior chips the endless Intel/AMD cycle will continue....

Maybe or just go into GME for a yes
GME is still viable, lots of short interest thats gonna get decimated and calls that are gonna expire, everyone investing in BB now was just too scared of GME.
Maybe take some profits and hold the rest if you still like the co
If it's anything like the last few weeks, very boring
Stimmy hangover next week . Get dem poots
So I missed the buy for BB, am I going to miss out if I put an order in for the morning?
Inverse this for tendies
You made nothing until the moment you sell
Lol
I bought PLTR today, just shares though, hopefully get some money for calls soon. Thanks for helping my confirmation bias!

Dude you're literally gambling. Stick it all into a mix of SPY/SPXL/QQQ/TQQQ/TMF/TLT/FNGU/SOXL and stfu.
Wait... Is trading stocks a skill set?

I am up 116% since the coronavirus dip in my main and 33% in my tfsa. Haven't watched a video or studied at all.

Only piece of advice I use is to invest in well managed companies.

GME, BB, and pretty much any other stock I try. I know for a fact that people have longer GME calls.
lit. short squeeze to the max. it hasn't even started! thats the best part.
The rocket launch upon announcement will be unreal  🚀
They are also short tons of shares. With their puts expiring OTM, they can’t exercise them to profit off their short positions, or to help cover them.  But they still have to cover the shares they borrowed.  Again, with the puts worthless they are underwater and will be forced to cover at higher and higher prices.

Yeah, I know what you mean! I've been following some of these post here and have been up 145% in the past week. Of course I do my own research, as well, before I pull the trigger. Some of the tickers I'm following now are  TSCRF (Score Media), TLSS, and now ATVK

what's your avg price per share?

its an ETF. Biden isn't even in office yet. We still haven't rejoined the Paris Agreement (we will day 1 according to him) and were still expecting a massive stimulus.  Your shares will rise steadily and beautifully over a bit of time. it's not a pump and dump. ETFs never are
But tell my why gme can do absolutely anything that the nintendo store (and Microsoft and Sony equivalent) combined with Amazon cannot already do super efficiently ?
I see it up 5% from close
how about a $50 call that expires tmrw?
Should I sell it tomorrow. I bought today.

100 shares @ 28. Not too concerned about the short term.
Why dont you YOLO everything in GME?
This is the way
Glad to be here now let's goooo 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
You’re fucked when it hits $70 tomorrow if you didn’t close those 1/15 calls.
Wouldn’t it take more sense to get the 500 shares rather than sell the call?
GME
Is joe Biden gonna walk out with like 10 CEOs during his pandemic pressers like that other guy did? Let’s find out together
But seriously, when should we sell our GME shares? Tommorow? Next week? Is there a chance the price will crash next week?

Yeah those are available. Weird how it’s not showing in the option chain

Risks increase closer to expiration, so it's really up to your tolerance.  Increased Gamma risk for shorts, and increased Theta risk for longs.
Imagine calling in mad money to pump your stock but Cramer shits on it instead

My portfolio tomorrow is going to be made up of 50% bb and 50% ge tomorrow. I’m selling all my positions and going all in tomorrow. Ge is one of the stocks that surprisingly hasn’t been pumped recently and they will be crucial for infrastructure transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

It's in part because the problem continually gets qorse, and thereforr it continues to make news. We don't really see headlines on the horriboe attrocities in regards to slavery because the problem got fixed. This problem has not. Once the problem is fixed, then headlines and news about it start to go away
> Do you have any idea how Glacier works?  I mean like physically? 

No, and they are intentionally vague about it.

> [This](https://www.itproportal.com/2013/11/09/one-of-techs-most-elusive-mysteries-the-secret-of-amazon-glacier/) guesses that it’s cabinets full of hard drives which—look I’m not here to judge anyone clearly these people know what they’re doing—sounds like a 12 year old from 1993 designed.

I suppose so long as it works in the manner they say it does, it's as secure as they claim it is and they don't lose your data... it doesn't really matter at the end of the day.

For what it's worth I would imagine that the article is pretty close to the money, purely on the basis that there's not all that many ways that Glacier CAN work - the data has to go somewhere at the end of the day, and why would it need to be any more complicated than banks of cheap, suitably replicated commodity HDDs?

If physical storage is a problem then subject to regulatory provision, I don't see why they can't just periodically migrate older data out to offshore data centers where both land to build them and manpower to operate them is cheaper than in the US.

Amazon have their own fiber, so it's not like they have to pay anyone for transit and they probably have plenty capacity for archival operations in the small hours of the morning once people stop streaming content:

would it be wise to buy some stocks on BB when the markets open or is it too late? Currently have 17.7 shares of GME at $37.99 since i went in a bit late. Thinking about buying £500 worth of shares with BB.

I had a limit order to sell my GME shares at $50, but I canceled that once I saw the after hours action 👀
So fundamentals are not driving this at all?
Correct, I was using artistic licence.
yeah true that.
No worries man!! But yeah it’s a limit order on em but I’ll just keep an eye tomorrow morning at open hopefully get in before you retards pump it up LOL
This is exactly how it happened

Learn about options. Its not about the price so much but how fast it rises and some other shit. There's quite a bit to it. I was up 18k off a $200 bet on Tesla when it went from 650-960.

So, it's not just making a $10 profit when it runs from $10‐$20.. It could be 10k profit

I've never traded RSI divergence, used to do a bit of OBV and CMF divergence trades in crypto a few years back though so I understand the concept.

I've never traded DXY either, but I wouldn't think an RSI divergence is enough to drive significant change in price with an asset that I imagine is driven by fundamentals so much.

If your mid term fundamental outlook on USD is bullish, then the technicals could definitely be a valid reason to get you into the trade, but if you expect that USD is going to continue to be devalued by US economic policy, then I wouldn't touch it.

My 2 cents for what little it's worth.
You son of a bitch. ❤️
Imagine how crazy Cramer’s GME segment will be tomorrow

 On fundamentals alone. I'm estimating 6b($80ish) market CONSERVATIVELY. Short squeeze is literally infinity. Whatever price target you want. Put your sell limit at something between 100-800 and it'll be bound to fill once the squeeze starts

I'm in a similar position, and I strongly agree with you. Experience in a specific language is rarely a large blocker to productivity for a senior eng, except for the first few months.

I do see the appeal of going out on your own though, but I'd never just switch to a junior position. Instead I'd pick and choose projects as a consultant or freelancer, or do my own projects.

wsb invesment advice PLC
My estimation for a longer term fair value for GME is $40+. The squeeze might take it higher than that. There's going to be a ridiculous amount of volatility for a long time. I typically make most of my money on Theta, so I'm most comfortable with recommending buying shares and selling covered calls against them. However, I'm not doing that with this play...I'm just in this for the entertainment of the SQUEEZE.
I agree with that but he did indeed hate bonds, and you’re right on the well-researched but there comes a line where well-researched speculation becomes investing for sure. I suppose unless you know everything about a company and you suspect that they will take over the market in their specific field I guess, I agree with you.
i took out a couple fds this morning for shits and giggles. just always hated gamestop so i never got on board. saw the rocket. see it *still gaining heavily after*. even ah today.

bro there is literally a new meme stock every week in this market

every single day there is an opportunity for a 10 bagger, you can't beat yourself up over this crap, its a goddamn casino at this point completely detached from all fundamentals, you gotta get lucky and hold a hype stock before it explodes
ok so in this example you don't want to buy in the 100-110 range because it might drop below? so you wait for it to make a move first?
This sub does more arguing over what the best investment strategy is than talking about tickers haha. Which I mean, I guess may be the point of the sub but its kinda funny cause its the same types of posts.

That being said the average intelligence here is MUCH higher than other subs and theres more collective knowledge. A lot of hot head new guys on the other subs.

Getting the equivalent of say, $500 in 2020 dollars, would be a pretty big deal for us (maybe...I think...who knows?) but we're not counting on it.

My gut feeling is that I will work until my mid-70s or later, in some way or another.

I'd ideally prefer to be in a position that I COULD retire at 65 if I want to, though.

We'll see.

Down to my last shares of GME boys.  Historical evidence suggests that we are 10-1000 percent away from the top.  Hope that helps.

thanks for the downvotes.  for every downvote ill buy another 8.50p for feb
Lol should I make 200% or should I risk losing it by being greedy? Take your money and laugh on the way to the bank
Squeeze is coming tomorrow and next week. Hold on  to your butt
No one in GME gang is talking about it but we are all wondering: 

GME GANG, WHO WOULD YOU RATHER FUCK, DFV OR RC?

Full disclosure: I'm not gay (can count on 1 hand the amount of dicks I've had in my ass).
anyone care about Churchilll anymore?
The plan has already been released. No pump 😞
Bro, how much of your entire net worth is this?
Only if he dies in the middle of the talk.
Most definitely, BB is a pump and dump as much as everybody in here wants it to go up. I’m going to get down voted but save your money man.
Holy shit, I’m in. I’m pretty sure your DD is all fucked up, but I’m in anyway. Been looking to get into silver.

My entirely biased vote would be GME.
GME and BB? I know there are longer contracts for those.

Shhhh we got this... got into TSLA right before the kick in the nuts today to try to scalp some momentum

So now I have 10 1/15 $860c I got too rammed on to dump hoping we move tm instead of MMs trading flat to fuck options
Interesting idea, looking forward to see others’ comments. The buy and hold strategy is always going to win in the long term, especially if you are DCAing along the way. Nothing bad about taking profits though, atleast on your initial investments.

Big if true
This has been so steady, I’m up 100 percent over the past week and my calls expire next November I’m pretty hyped
This is amazing
I sold game at 17 (after buying at 16 something at it going down to 12) and BB at 5 (wasn’t moving like the others). I have mine a loads of places and I’ve very little chargers and it’s mostly free unless I trade loads. So I get a lot of mooners - NIO SPCE and PLUG recently done me very well. I tried to do some pre covid that will climb back to March levels eventually, and then loads of different sectors because if one takes a hit the others pick up on that day. I only ever lose money after a good day which is fine and expected.
Split it 50/50 next time so at least you won’t lose out at least.

Nice! thank you. I bought 225 worth of jagx and it just tanked and hasn't recovered since. Just wanna get close to my original amount and buy something else.

Also a lot of it is: I want to be able to eventually provide for my future family and have a nice house as my own place where I can weather the craziness that is out there. Retirement is fucked, society is changing and crime is going up, Chinese threatening democracy, free speech under attack, ...

I want to be able to purchase some peace, security and solitude for myself so I dont need to care/worry that much anymore.

Lol! He YOLO’d 100k a year ago.
just the Ah action lol.. was seeing gme drop a bit as bb rise
Well, yes. Any business should. They have services you pay just like spotify, that allows you to play music in your retail shop/restaurant/commercial establishment. They are using it a artists work in the course of earning their business. We're not talking huge sums of money here per business, those types of services aren't too expensive for businesses. 

Soundstr is not for these small little restaurants that just play some music in the ceiling speakers, or a clothing store, office, etc. Soundstr could be used by the service which provides the music to those small businesses to stream. Soundstr will inside of radio stations too, which it already is BTW and working with more that 99% accuracy according to the beta test results. Soundstr is for restaurants & bars with live stages, clubs, etc. 

The ultimate idea here is making sure royalties get into the right hands by making it affordable for businesses to be compliant and pay royalties. For bigger artists this isn't a huge problem.. but for the smaller acts, this will be world changing!
So a couple $285c 1/28???

It's up to them. If they capitulate, they could go long on the squeeze to make money back. Or they continue to short at higher prices expecting a reversal at some point. Think of it like a dollar cost averaging for a shorted position. And there will be a reversal. Squeezes always collapse at some point. If you could short on the way back down, you would make a lot of money.

I’m really torn about tomorrow. Was gonna go BB, but put some in WOOF instead. FCEL hurt me today, sitting at $18 and a half.

Your multileg contract should appear as one contract in the app. Select it and select the leg you want to close.

If you are changing the play, just always be sure to do it as part of a plan and not on the basis of emotion.

Yeah I mean if you can time the top riding this back down is going to be very profitable. I'm debating if I have the balls to do it myself, but if gme continues down this path I may just cash out everything except for what I started my account with and walk away once the squeeze is through.
They have a short position; essentially the borrowed shares from the broker to sell way back when that they need to pay back but were betting it would go down. So they may have short sold shares for $4/ea but now will need to pay $40/ea to obtain them cause they owe the broker
I hear ya, I had the same question yesterday.  Basically a lot of people smarter than me, looked at a bunch of indicators and determined most of the buying wasn’t by shorts.  


I checked out a solid 2% of what they said & it seems to hold up.  Lol 


General logic (for short sellers) is to not cover on the “peak” day of news (Cohen’s addition to the board).  So it makes sense most wouldn’t cover yesterday.  Plus, not everyone follows the news every minute or day.  


I’m off this week, but normally when I’m working I catch up on news after the markets close.  I know I’m not alone on that.  So I expect most people who would cover would not have had a chance to do so until today.  


On top of that, most people would not have gotten a margin call until today, so I doubt many were forced to cover yesterday.  


Just judging from people in this sub & not in this sub, there was a lot of FOMO, and a lot of selling and re-buying (that’s me, I did that).  So a lot of the volume seems to be Not shorts again.  They may be hoping to ride “spike” out, but I think it was a triggering event and the pride can’t drop much due to all the people who need to buy.

It all depends on your situation.

Are you going to be adding money to it regularly as time goes on? If yes, there's a good chance these old investments will slowly become irrelevant as you add more money to the portfolio.

Are you going to generate huge taxable gains? Will a new/better investment do well enough to justify the tax bill?
The plan is already out
Shhhh I just bought
I sold $49p a week ago and am honestly kind of hoping I get assigned tomorrow so I can ride it back up.
It's very important to remember that they changed the recipe in the late 90s.

They're still good but nothing like the old fried recipe.

My gut feeling is that you'll be like, "Hrmm...slightly oily saltine with tons of sodium and hint of chicken bullion. B- at best."

It could be a taste you only really love when it's mixed with nostalgia. Like Mt. Dew.

I went from 2.6k to 5k in about two weeks, I thought for sure I had finally found my way to consistent gains then I got too attached to BNGO, CHEK, and OCGN and panic sold at big losses only for all of them to go straight back up like the very day I sold them when they were still down. Now i have to scale back all my buys to like 50/100 shares at a time and try to be more mindful before I start going big again.

But as long as you stay committed and dedicated to the game you will get it. If you really feel you need that one on one help I would get a forex mentor. But be careful and don’t get scam because there are a lot of them trying to sell a dream rather than teach and then you got some that just scam. But keep reading and using the resources to help you. Its for the long run, stay positive.

NGA just mooned 6% after hours just now lol.
You buy the OPTION to purchase 100 shares at $15, and the cost to purchase that option is let's say $0.50 so you spent $50 total. 

The stock skyrockets to $20/share, and now the price of that option has increased as well. You sell it for $2 and make $200.

Had you just bought stocks, you'd buy 5 shares for $50 and sell them at $20 to make $100, doubling your investment. With the call option you risked less initial capital and quadrupled your investment.

How do we know when the short squeeze starts/is over
That’s just buying and selling the option and yeah that’s right and you sell to close the option on Robinhood to do so. But options have a huge premium on them right now because of the volatility so the closer it gets to the expiration date on the option, the value either gets closer and closer to the strike price x100 if it’s in the money or to 0 if it’s out of the money. So if the shortest hold off the squeeze for a week you could lose everything on a 1/22 January call

Cramers respect for Autists is good to see. Glad he is on the side of the little guy as Autist’s together can make plays. Peopl  like Bill (H)Ackman have been moving stocks for YEARS by just going on afternoon CNBC and staying their postition to move stock their direction. Power to the Autists.

Anyone have a link to watch the speech tonight ?
Their profile complains about being banned for spamming, while scrolling for 5 seconds gets you the same article & title posted 20 times.
Im hoping so. I've got a decent bit saved already, so the next few months I'm rolling 30-40% of savings on cannabis, clean energy, and fuel/travel.

In reality, it could be(probably is) a big gamble.. but I'm young and if it pays off then it might pay a nice chunk of my future house. If not, oh well.

Definitely getting in BB tomorrow. Don’t care if it’s at the top and I lose. Not sitting on the sidelines on this one.
Checking in.

Because all the dominoes are setup. Just a question of tripping the first one or getting saved by the Fed once again.

Well that's a drag. Can you please tell me what I did wrong. Is there another way I can phrase my question

My RH year recap?
you look at short percentage
Predictions for tmrw:

Green energy mentioned briefly in Biden speech. ILCN stagnates, FCEL dumps with heavy volume of selling the news

AMZN rockets early morning then tanks to ~$3170 eod

GME finishes the day at $44

GIGA ends the day at $19

I end the day -9%
You serious? Lol
That’s the thing though. They can reclaim as soon as they aren’t. Meaning they need to be able to pay the current share price in the amount of shares the shorted. If a small player gets screwed and can’t anymore, then it could trigger. I remember seeing a while back someone writing that the average short price was $4 (this likely changed since then). But made sense seeing as how GME traded for years at that level. Imagine shorting x amount of shares at $4 and now it’s 10x higher in 2 days. Scary stuff.

Could you share your calculations ? Are you generating it with code ?
I'm doubtful. But we will see
Maybe Warren needs to get out of the house more. 

But seriously how can it be so rare to beat the S&P 500, when it just reflects the averaged returns of a large basket of companies? Roughly half of the companies in there would be expected to outperform the s&p, over any given period. 

99.9% can't beat the average return? Although this claim is often repeated, the math just doesn't check out to me. Any explanation is appreciated.

i've been collecting downvotes all day.  i said this morning once it hit over +20pct im loading up on puts.  even if i get burned i honestly don't care because i'm doing my part.  bb is absolutely the worst fucking stock of all time. their ceo is so fucking dogshit.  he sits around the office lighting money on fire all day while literally every other competitor that came 5 years later prints.  im praying for WSB on this one.
What do you mean?
Up right? Not into the ground?
Last week it did absolutely fantastic. If you're out after 1 week of red on an ETF then you just bought at the top. It's meant to be months of holding. Not one week.

Being able to get them isn't necessarily a good idea. If they are UK non-reporter/non-distributor status (many US ETFs are) then you are liable to pay income tax on gains at your marginal rate instead of capital gains tax. That's a real downer.

There are three oil-themed ETFs that I think are available to UK & EU investors which may interest you: SPOG is one ... also EXH1 and XSER.

There are also some investments trusts, if I remember right, BRCI? Not sure if it's still around. 

but TBH? just chucking it into RDSB/TOT/BP/XOM/CVX in 20% chunks is as good as an ETF anyway assuming you have a W8-BEN set up.

Remember to check reporting status. 

Finally as a UK investor you have the potential of a big tax advantage by splitting 50/50 BP & RDSB instead of an oil ETF. You will pay no dividend withholding tax (vs 15% USA, 26.5% France with Total, 15% on Irish ETFs holding US stocks (hidden from you)).
Don’t be like me. I purchased them minute after close and it likely now won’t go through bc the post market is over 10 now!!!

Wrong bro. They’ll need some on board. Facts.
🤞
So let's say you will work for 20 years then at 50 you can retire  if you start now by putting €1000 pcm into the etfs and stocks I would guess your going to get 10% roi  that will give you a lump sum of €730,000 From this money you can take 5% a year income so €3000 a month ever month for life and your €730,000 should stay intact  on top of the €3,000 You will have any work pension I would guess that the total would go up at government pension age (67)  to €4000 per month this should give you a nice life in a cheap county like southern Italy  

 if you are happy to work and save for 10 more years till you are 60 you will have  about €2,100,000 this will give you €8750 a month + other work and government pensions  == €10,000 a month that's sweet  and can be done from etfs reits and some solid dividend stocks  or  you could just buy a vanguard s&p 500 and sell the rest of your holdings as the roi will be very similar.

A 2nd  plan is to dump the etfs and buy 100% growth stocks  for the next 10 years to build a lot of cash up 

If you bought a stock like tattooed chef or Callaway golf  you could get a 20% a year roi   so if you invest €5000 today then  €1,000 every month and can find a 20% roi for the next 10 years you will have €375,000 at 40years old at this stage you could start buying dividend stocks with dividends of about 4% + 7% growth  you reinvest the dividends + pay in the €1,000 ever month  and at 50 years old you will have €1,277,000 or €5,300 per month work till 60 and you will have €3,800,000 or €16,000 + work pension + government  pension €20,000 per month 

So your looking at a monthly income when you retire of somewhere between €3000 And €20,000 a month 

As you can see its a nice to go for growth stocks to build up a big amount and get €20,000 a month or even retire at a younger age on €10,000 

You told me not to roast you so please take this as nicely as you can 

you don't need a ETFs that your age get some growth going so you can build a decent portfolio fast you got to take a little bit of risk imo 

I haven't even looked at your ETFs but they're going to return about 10% imo that sucks dew to your young age 

All them stocks suck as well have you seen how much debt they've got compared to income Enbridge is a great stock, with a nice dividend the sweating struggling to men saying it but they are maintaining it is a perfect stock for a 70 year old to hold not a 29 year old,  there going to have  a hard life.  And so are you if you hold that  the same goes for Imperial tobacco  everybody else in the market is buying clean energy  and your buying this lot that sucks imo 

If you give me your portfolio I would sell everything tomorrow at market open  except j&j I would hold that for the next 6 months as they will do well this year 

I would then  hold cash €3000  and invest the other €9,000 into 4 good quality growth stocks with market caps between 1 and 10 million  that can bring me 20% roi a year  I would buy tattooed chef  Walgreens and plug  and Callaway golf then add €1000 a month and go for a €2,000,000 pension and retire early at 50 on €8,000 a month 

All the above is an example it dose not take into account tax but I stand by this as very posibull to achieve  

Also for anyone that says 5% Is not possible and 3% or 4% is more realistic I don't expect that as the  4% rule has recently been updated to 5% by its creator he stated that he was too harsh in the face place with a 4% Rule and 5% is more appropriate
Lmaoooo ur gonna be mad when it goes up 😂

yeah unsure as to why but so it goes
Given that so mu h of my income goes towards housing, transportation and just general basic living expenses, in a lot of ways I also suspect on top of the 4 decades of Stagnant wages, we're also overall paying a higher effective tax rate. Where the idle rich can rake in $, sit on their butts AND pay lower taxes and hire an army of tax attorneys/lawyers/politicians/lobbyists so comparitively they're getting a free ride.

I think big bois playing it safe, due to corona and a lot of unemployement, not many have been able to afford iphone 12, but they talk about huge sales, not seen since 2014. i think it'll go up about 15% and 200 by eoy if market doesnt crash on us
Hope Biden doesn't talk about shutdowns, we are fucked then

Love these write-ups! Keep it up and thanks!
 BIDEN IS PRINTING MONEY HE SAID U GET MONEY FOR HAVING LOTS OF KIDS. BULLISH
Yes! Got to put some into that one. This is the way.
Regardless, if I read correctly, a market cap of $4B would be like $60/share. They have over $1B in revenue last quarter. It's undervalued even at $60 now that Cohen has 3 board seats.
What's your youtube?
Wow. Gme put contracts about $100 more than calls at equal price.
Pretty much.  It will vary based on the brokerage - some brokerages have slightly different rates, some require interest payments daily, some let it accrue and then compound the interest.  


Either way,  it’s gonna hurt & it’s gonna hurt worse fast.  They are literally looking at the potential for profit going to zero (if it’s not there already). 


Lastly, they can’t just short more shares, cause that will drive the interest rate up & there aren’t more shares to borrow.  Screwed either way.

Thinking the same. Might roll my GME gains over into a few hundred shares tomorrow right at open
WSB going full retard
VW is nothing like GME. VW was an infinity squeeze driven by the fact that short sellers were shorting shares while porsche was accumulating them effectively reducing the public float.
No problem! And that's totally understandable, always put your money where your comfortable. I did so much research before investing in NIO.
We need enough ownership to get a seat on the board.
Absolutely agree, also we need to get the message out to set incredibly high limit sell prices so shorts can’t borrow our shares!

How are your calls not down? I lost 2k today on Jan 2022 cals.
People were speculating (back in September) that VALE might be the company that got a deal with TSLA. They weren't it, but a couple months later some other positive news came out that I can't remember.

I don't follow VALE so i have no idea what's going on.
Recalling back to GME at 9 after a run up from 6 and thinking "oh, I could buy a few hundred shares and just sell CC if this DD actually blows" and then deciding to buy PSTH.  I'm not angry I'm just disappointed
Dumped ICLN bought more GME, money is better than no money imo
Why
No, but trying to give good advice is. You'd have to be absolutely braindead to not sell any of it. I'm commenting for 0.1% chance that you're not a troll and actually mean this.

You've made a stupid amount of money, but it's not *yours* until it's actually in your bank account, and no matter how confident you are you can never be completely sure that the stock will keep rising. For all you know you could lose it all tomorrow because Elon accidentally detonates a bomb in the factory and kills himself with it.

That's unlikely to happen, but the point is that you never know. Lesson 1 of gambling is to quit when you're ahead. Sell half or even a quarter of it and you protect yourself from any risk while still keeping a large amount invested.
Either that or community college. I went to a state school and commuted and it was still 16k per year

Stupid. Look at all the other parabolic stocks recently. They run on up to the moon. This has like 3 or 4 days left
Omg yes! Are we actually doing this I was joking? I'm in on 2023 $5s but they have decayed a bit since summer.

Nah, it’s an etf, 40 is a huge move. Even if it gets assigned I’ll have 100% profit plus premium so I won’t be sad either way
AMZN is still lower than July's high. Your one year leaps may not be as safe as you think they are
Holding onto my 3 shares of gme, whoop!
I’m still waiting
Lol. DPZ is a health stock because they reduce the amount of cheese available for consumption.
I was of similar thought prior to recently. The narrative has changed though. This isn't about CenturyLink. It's about their fiber assets and Level 3 business. The traditional ISP business is paying the debt, dividend and providing cash flow for them to grow the more enticing side of the business.

Cheap debt and a market looking for the next play provides the setup to send this stock much higher.
Got my account over $25K with unlimited day trades and a bunch of margin. Day trading shares instead of options is nice.

gonna explode from fluff
anyone got a link to the buyden stimmy speech
Agreed. MarketMakers hedging will create an endless feedback loop up, until it doesn’t...
Yeah no this makes no sense. All ps5 are sold out as is and any new stock is immediately sold. And if you're refering to scalpers $1200 consoles, that's third party also makes no sense.
Why BB?

Why is the stock going up now? I saw the DD a month or so ago, and bought a share to see what happens. Q4 earnings come and go, the stock is going down, and I sold at a loss. Is there a specific piece of news causing this, or just people waking up to the facts we’ve known for awhile?
I'm still debating to put $50 on GME...

[Priceless](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4v1lhf/margin_in_401k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
You son of a bitch you've earned all the praise.
The plan was to launch them Q4 2020, which has obviously come and gone at this point. With such a dramatic end of the year can you blame anyone for not getting things done? 

That said, its expected to launch any day. Many people seem to believe that funding round being completed will be announced just after a share buyback is quietly completed so they can have the biggest impact with the buyback move, buying up more shares and ultimately making the run go up higher!! Then they will probably right away announce the launch of the 450 units. Making for a dash to dollar land!

\*\*please note, all my opinion based on known facts out there\*\*
I just assume 90% of the people there have a net worth under 500k.

To be fair most of the people here who make posts like “how to invest 1MM” are also probably worth $80 at best.
2/5 15c that’s gonna be the play in the morning
after their last earnings, I'm not touching that with a 10 foot pole
Do it
Dude no, this shit isn’t even the full squeeze yet. And tomorrow not all shorts get covered. Just Melvin. We hold until all the shorts are covered then this thing really rockets. 200 easy.
Dude this market is once in a lifetime, but $TAN and just stop worrying about it. TAN will see at least 100% gains this year. I buy individual green energy stocks (ENPH and IEA mostly), but you can just buy the etf and not even think about it.
AMD, like Apple, hold an ARM Architecture License, which is the big boy-"do what you want"-license similar to their x86 license, not the peasant "pay money to ARM/Nvidia for every Chip sold"-license. And they are apparently working on some ARM stuff, rumor has it together with Microsoft, but thats only a rumor.
I didn't catch this other one, I just joined like 2 days ago
I’ll go ahead and ride this with GME - to the moon/front page and beyond.

Yup Chinese shit is too dangerous to play for long
PLEASE SELL EVERYTHING AND RETIRE
🤯 genius
It will go up so high and fast that a 20% correction won’t even make you feel concerned. Go back up 10% then start dropping again.
But what about Burry’s Tesla shorts?
Yes, but often they attach a lot of pro big business bailouts to these bills. Do we have all the info yet?
Based on [this article](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/13/amd-ceo-says-apples-m1-chip-is-opportunity-to-innovate-underscores-ongoing-graphics-partnership) it seems like Apple will continue to use AMD for discrete graphics. The GPU on the new M1 chips seems to be [roughly equivalent to that of a low tier mobile Nvidia/AMD GPU](https://www.techradar.com/news/apples-m1-chip-can-apparently-outperform-some-amd-and-nvidia-graphics-cards).
It was, however the price hasn’t really been affected that much. It’s just trading in a range right now.
Chad PLTR crew checking in
imagine talking shit and giving up on ICLN a green energy ETF before Biden has even entered office and before he's reentered the USA back into the Paris Agreement (which he promised he'd do Day 1) and before he introduces his 3 TRILLION with a T dollar infrastructure plan.

If you bought weeklies you are an idiot.  Leaps and shares will PRINT over the course of 2021 like a beautiful, long, steady GREEN bean stalk

I reject the whole Tesla is the underdog story. I’ve spent my entire life supporting underdogs in countless areas; Tesla is a messed up company ran by a messed up individual since day one. The way they’ve attached their underdog image along with their narrative, while the stock corruptly shoots up to unfathomable levels and they overtake the entire car industry turns my stomach. They are not qualified to be industry leaders and also do not deserve it. 

Again to my original point, yes the other car manufacturers aren’t perfect, but they all have a long history of safety recalls no matter how much it sucks to do a recall, they all have a long track record of doing them. To act like Tesla is the good guy in this arena and all other car companies are subpar is laughable.

Even beyond the recalls, if you want to talk about life threatening scenarios, Tesla absolutely takes the cake by misleading consumers with their ‘full self driving’ technology. They prematurely were telling people “in the future you will be able to take a nap or read a book while driving, and the future is now” which was completely misleading and a ploy to sell cars. Even now, their full self driving technology is nowhere close to where it needs to be. There are countless stories of auto-pilot crashes that could have been avoided if the company was just honest about their tech from day one,
Same story w PLUG. 🙃
Yo thank you bro. It was you. I got in at 1.06 at 100 shares and averaged up to 2000 at 1.21

I am just finding this out after the market has closed 

That pos is already up 50% since it split a week ago
Yahoo estimates $1.25 1Y target and it's already at $1.31
not an options expert, though I hold 4/16 35Cs... 
Really up to you, but as it is with questions like 'is it too late', I always answer: it's only too late if the squeeze has been squoze.. and last time i checked, it hasn't yet... not specific advice though, just thinking out loud
If you think that's fucked I had NIO 10c leaps expiring in 2022 that I sold back when NIO was like 8 bucks.
Come out, Jonathan. Mama wants to pump
I have $30C and 60C that expire in 2022. I also have a bunch of $19cs that I got at $11 that expire tomorrow, and a bunch of low 20s for February. 100% of my account is in TLRY. I’ve been closing strikes over the past week and moving them deeper because it hasn’t slowed in momentum and the merger will happen in a couple months so I plan to ride it for a while. I don’t have specific target but I’m very bullish
All time Highs don't apply to you if you have a long time horizon

I’m retarded. But at what short percentage do we know the squeeze is over
Paper trade
Supreme Court ruled on this. Yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theater not protected speech. Presumably, "I won the election, go stop them from counting the electors" isn't either.

Regardless. Twitter and Facebook are products. If we're still capitalists here, businesses should be allowed to determine what their products are used for. If Twitter doesn't want to be used as a communication tool to overthrow the government I'm on board.
I think cnbc had an article about the merger not happening, but gave no sources why.
I'm still in on some shares

It's a self-selection bias. As the stock rises all of those on GME keep shouting louder. When it drops, people dissapear and the meme dies (for the moment). The same thing just happened with PLTR, and earlier than that with TSLA. TSLA's disappointment was brutal after battery day. It took until now for people to come back to meme TSLA.

Look. Just my opinion but you’ve already won. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. Maybe trim half your position to get back your investment plus some and let the others roll? Then if it runs from there, trim another 10% and so on until you’re out. 

But you won, try not to run past the finish line.

Do it. If you’re using a broker that lets you buys in fractions you’ll get one and a somethings worth of a share. If they don’t you’ll need to add more just to buy a single share in the future or worse, never buy a share and miss out on the opportunities.

I live in a state where recreational marijuana is illegal and know many people who drive 2-3 hours to the neighboring state that has legal dispensaries and stock up and drive back home.
I sell a call. I don't cover. The stock price reaches the strike price. I cover. There is no risk of me losing money except if the price of the stock goes down. At which point i can sell. 

I sell a call, I don't cover. The call is really far. REALLY FAR. The stock price moves halfway to the strike, i get spooked. I buy.

A call goes into the money, it gets exercised, the person does not sell the stock back, they keep it. The price has gone up. 

A call goes into the money, it had ALREADY been covered, it gets exercises, the person sells it, the price goes down.

Multiple people cover before their strike is reached, they all cause the price to go up, this causes more people to have to cover. It's an infinite loop (tsla)

I sell a put, i want to buy but cant because I want to have the money if the put goes into the money, the put is now out of the money by a considerable margin, i now feel safe in buying the stock itself which i believe in (because i sold the put)

Earnings might be rough, but they’ll bounce back. They’re going to go back up to pre-Covid highs within this next year most likely.

You could try to sell before earnings, but if you did that I’d suggest to buy back in after earnings. I would say minimum 30% gain this next year. Realistically I could see closer to 50% gain.

Maybe just buy some long term calls following earnings and forget about them.
How far out you thinking?

Biden stimmy 1 all about covid recovery.  Maybe some infrastructure and clean energy mentioned but those are to be featured in stimmy 2. 

The big question is which senator had the smol pp and will immediately tweet NO to stimmy 1, killing any pump
Buyden stimmy is insanely mid
Agreed! Thank you for the IONI DD. It followed the same pattern as CLWD — peaking the following day. It pumped and then a lot of people dumped it the same day, but I’m happy I held on. It’s remained consistent at and holding in the .70s/.80s.  I think there may be another surge tomorrow but if not, might be good to hold. It was a good DD with projections at $2-4 if you don’t mind holding it.
In a way, legging in or out is a way to be more directional on a position and adjusting delta, is this correct?

Also, what's your hourly rate, my cat was in a car accident
Robin Hood has an instant deposit of $1k
I guess nobody at all realised those things and it was just you who knows about them
So you essentially want to buy long term calls for something that’s doing okay right now and that you think is going to rise up to above the strike price at the expiration date?
this sucks for a comedy account. happy cake day though
31. I'm confident it won't drop below my average, at least for any significant amount of time.

On Robinhood you have to certify that you’re a seasoned trader and know what you’re doing and then that’s it. But I’d get a general understanding of what you’re doing before you trade options.

Wow Biden is a worse speaker than Trump this is embarrassing.
Exactly. Also as small business owner he gets fucked on taxes, interest on loans, and the rising of conglomerates in all industries. Even in sewer and septic work we are facing it. So he sees this as him giving the middle finger to large institutions.
That was actually euthanasia
It's almost like he is a prophet (I realize these were the only Jan date available when he bought last year). I wonder if there was some serious coordination with knowing these calls were out in the wild? I don't know how to figure out how many open contracts exist for a specific strike/date.

Personally I’m considering adding more shares. Helps the squeeze and the options IV is crazy. Although if a squeeze happens to the likes what of what is expected it won’t matter.
 Why did WSB think slow-moving ETFs were gonna be the key to weekly tendies? It's a good bet but not for 30% daily returns.

Set a target price and exit half at that level. Let the rest run until the next Fibonacci level is reached and exit half after that. And so forth. 

So far $50 is the reasonable level to exit based on consensus view and $100 if you're greedy.

HELLS YEAH
Averaged down yesterday and today, need bounce
For many reasons, the main one being to keep greater ownership of the company. Or to give the impression of high worth and attractiveness. 

I don’t know the ins and outs of this specific case but when you see big swings like that then yes, the company has usually taken major action.
Hahah I’ve got no money invested through them. I had just paid somebody through there and noticed you could ‘trade’ 🤣


I’ll stick to my definitely better broker—Robinhood 😏😍🥴😍🥰
How tf did you know ?
I literally bought them just after open too for $1.02. Should have stayed at the doctor incase my erection lasts longer than 4 hours.
Good time to buy was today's dip, might not be tomorrow after his speech.

Let's see if this works: $AMZN closes ~$3160 tomorrow given the OI walls I see.

A less bold prediction: between $3100 and $3200.


Remind me if I'm wrong!
sorry was practicing my chant for the speech
Hahaha WSB made it into The Wall Street Journal because of GameStop. Holy fuck lads, we made it. I can almost see a movie being made about this.
We’ll have to buy in the AM I think. Are you using Rh?
Yep
Ha! Same. I bought the i7-10700K for only $20 more than the Ryzen 5 5600X.
I hope spy opens at a min of 380.
That is literally impossible 

PLTR 40 EOM!!
The PLTR desperation on this board is sad to watch. It's not too late to jump onto the GME rocketship
Surely there’s better value for $$$
Yeah and two ex members in the Biden admin.

They will have a lot of power in the near future.
It dilutes your shares and investors hate that shit so this is usually coupled with a selloff. It’s like you had a pie sliced into 4 pieces and you own 1 slice of the pie. But now they add some more cuts to make the pie sliced into 8 pieces but you still own 1 slice of the pie.

New retard here. I bought an TLRY18c expiring tomorrow at the end of today for $0.76. I was thinking to just dump it pretty quick at the opening and be happy with the 40+% return. Just wanted to know what other people do when they're ITM at expiration.

Something big will go down in the next 2-3 months. A 100% allocation to commodities, critical metals and crypto is a very smart thing to do.
Have you found one? 😭
The 200IQ move is to short GME after the squeeze is done
Most people dont have $500 a week to gamble with. Jesus, how disconnected is this place from the rest of the planet?

Me personally I buy $1k to $2k of options every few months (maybe 3,sometimes 4 times a year), that's what I can afford to put into something this risky. But the idea that you can get rich fairly quickly from this is absurd. Sure, I've had some nice gains. But I've also had some big losses.

I would agree. The paper I linked is fairly limited in what it analyses as a wealth transfer.
You're being far too lenient, those people will be criticised for not pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, even those who don't get unfair advantages handed out to them.
I’m glad you see it too. When XOM dropped to like 35 on earnings, I posted that calls on them would be literal free money. I’m up around 100k on that trade in a little over a month. 

Between all the oil majors I have 1400 calls. We’re printing incredibly hard right now.

Yeah the TARP bailout of ~$800bn was ridiculed by the public yet now we have $6.2 trillion of stimulus, plus another $1.9 trillion on the way.  Where's the outrage there?  Keeping rates low, CoV-2, and the Fed/Gov't stimulus has quintupled the inequality, which we've already seen in the markets, public and private.  This is only the beginning.

College education (and private K-12 education) costs have skyrocketed with PE companies buying out Pearson for example with the intent of extorting students via textbook costs.  The colleges/universities turned more towards a business model because they know government backed student loan lenders (Sallie Mae) will bail them out if a graduate defaults on their loan.  Plus universities need the newest technology, buildings, etc. to attract students.

Hes actually gonna get fcked hard. Heres the thing, if this was 2008 he would of won no doubt.

Investing has changed loads since then, dont listen to people when they say this is the same  bubble as the 90's or whenever. Think about it logically, and why people are buying and holding

Why is GME actually already at 40? It should be around $5 no? That fact that it even got to $20 is proof that meme stonks are powered hard by loyal followers. Its basically like an instagram account lmao. The more followers, the more support, and the more buys. If it goes down, people will buy more.

&#x200B;

Thats my understanding of Tsla at the moment, for sure though do your own research. This is just my conclusion I reached

Does anyone here even know what a short squeeze? I’m constantly seeing people use the term improperly lol. You can’t just short squeeze a stock cause you want to, you need short sellers at a high short ratio. I know 90% of you are autistic but it’s annoying seeing short squeeze said on every stock 😂
Wow...
God I hope
Ok, ok. Borrowed shares at a shitty low price because they thought the price later would be *even* shittier. Then bought 1/15 16p thinking they could basically pay back the shares they borrowed at 4x profit or so.

We don't know how many shares they borrowed because they don't need to disclose that information. But we ***do*** know that they took out 54,000 16P. So assuming the short interest is ~half+ them, we can assume.... 🌈🐻  r fuk?

We dont need them lobbying against us. I dont like hearing WSB shoutouts from people with audience that's just me though.
If GME hits $50 tomorrow, Im prob gonna jack off into a ceiling fan as a celebration. Ima call it "Cumfetti"
I know everyone wants to be deepfuckingvalue but if your calls aren’t either deep itm or longer dated than one week take your fucking profits. No one here knows how long the squeeze will last or how high gme will go. Don’t be one of the retards in the coming weeks bitching in here how you didn’t take profits when you had the chance.
That's because they're dead. No longer alive.

I remember reading stock boards back in the dot.com era....P/E? Whats that? To the moon! Deja vu....the smart ones cashed out...the other pretty much lost it all...
Yup. I audibly sigh every time someone mentions profits or p/e with a growth stock. Guess what? If you quit aggressively reinvesting in the business, profits suddenly explode! Who would’ve thought! Idiots.

Everyone has their situation.

I personally set stop losses because I might need the money in a few months but don’t wanna miss the gains. 

I know it’s risky and if for whatever reason it can’t sell or execute I am ok leaving that money in the market but ideally I will be selling some of my shares towards something else in September.
Could you also explain a share? I am new and my...jk
I’ve never actually made a call before on any stock. Is that a safe or risky call?

I mean yeah but those are also more expensive so you gotta balance it. Ideally you buy it before it starts doing good (having high volatility) so you can buy more for cheaper but it’s past that now which is why people are advising shares right now. Yolo if you wish tho, if there was ever a time to do it it’s now. I’m already in with good gains but I might double down tomorrow as well
Stonks only go up
Thank you! Yo people talking shit on here about ICLN are driving me insane. The guy isn't even in office yet and people expect it to skyrocket. Give the thing a god damn chance.
Nope.  Buy GME.  Scream it from the rooftops.  14 year olds should be downloading RH and buying GME shares.
Don’t panic sell!!! Can you set notifications on the brokerage app you use? You’ll have a heart attack if you’re checking every few minutes or every few hours! 

And as others have said, you can’t lose money if you don’t sell, lol.
Someone please tell me what to do. I really don't want to miss this trip to the moon.

Many thanks from Germoney my friends!

Fuck going to college mate, become a day trader

yeah. i really need to avoid looking at my portfolio and what it used to be/could’ve been cuz it’s all in the past now. makes me wanna make as much as possible on every trade and i end up losing money for it. missed a lot of gains this week from selling early and they’ve been making me feel like i gotta make it all back. thought i could start upping the contracts when i made a lot of money and got clapped back to where i started after 3-4 decent losses. thanks for the advice. really need to start thinking before fomoing in and using my emotions
Did you get out of your PLTR yolo for this? 

I was following that lol
The math says it can go much higher. Like absurdly high. The stock is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in recent history. The major institutional short sellers have been so idiotically greedy that they’ve shorted too many shares for all of them to actually cover. This creates a scenario in which a mega short squeeze can occur, meaning a self-reinforcing cycle of the stock price shooting up, the shorts losing massive amounts on their positions and being forced to buy shares on the market to cover their short positions, which further ramps up the price. It’s a snowball effect. And it hasn’t even really started yet with GME. The institutions’ response today was to try to *short it even more*. And even with that, the stock went up substantially. There are very few shares available now for shorting so they will have fewer ways to artificially force the price down. Plus tomorrow is the monthly option expiration and there are a ton of puts outstanding that will now expire worthless; the vast majority of these are held by the same institutional short sellers. They’ve been shorting GME for years, profiting hugely trying to force the company into bankruptcy.
Plz tell me my plug FD’s are safe
Just don’t hold it with the hope it goes back up. If you believe in the company and did your research, hold it. If you’re only hoping for it to go back up because you’re red, take your losses and continue. 

It’s better to lose 10% now then 30% in the long run.

Lesson learned. Believe me all have had lessons like this. My first rule in stocks (especially day trading) control your losses. Also don’t keep watching it after you sold your loss because you’ll feel bad and will trade with your emotion instead of your knowledge.
I need a hug, I have some shit that expires worthless.
You deleted it
The question really is. Where is jack ma?
You know what they say the blacker the berry the sweeter the fruit. $bb 25 eow confirmed.

Sir this is a glory hole
Man this is lowkey fire if the calls don't work out, you put this shit on Spotify and get some of yo money back.
You can resell the option contract and keep all the profit from the stock value increase. (without buying stock)
New to reading charts so I hope this isn't a dumb question, it looks like it has the potential to be ~1.60 short term which would make a good selling point?

Sell me on BB, why is it mooning.
link?
Pure 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Glad I checked the daily thread at lunch and saw someone talking about BB. Already up 80% on 1/22s. Cheers to whoever called it. 🍻
Trending downwards for 5 years bud. Give me something tangible I can understand that makes this worthy
Is that patten manning?
LUMN is a buy and hold stock.  That is NOT the way child.

Extrinsic value will delay the exercising of calls. Covering chains will not be delayed.

I’d be fine with it if it had raised steadily over the past week. Instead it’s been up to 34, down to 31, and struggled to stay above 32.50. I don’t need to to be at $50, just a firm $33.
I’ve been hard way longer than 4 hours LFG KING
700 @ 8 but could have been so much lower :(
You buy a stock at $100 and sell at $200 you make $100. 

You short a stock at $200 and it goes down to $100, you make $100.

You buy a stock at $100 and it goes to $0 the most you can  lose is $100.

You short a stock at $100 and it gets pumped to $500 you lose  $400, and sometimes much more.

\^ That is a short squeeze.
You're exactly right
Man I have a 4 day weekend starting tonight
What is all this talk about a potential short squeeze with BB? Haven’t seen any DD on that. Then again I can’t read.
Please Gme hit 50 tomorrow I wanna make my first 1000
So I’m going to start to get into options 🎉🎉🎉  This is my practice run to get my feet wet. I’ve done a decent amount of research but I still am confused with some of the more technical stuff. 

So I am using Robinhood and have bought: 

SENS $2 call 2/19 (my order is queued)

So to my novice understanding, I have the right to buy x100 SENS at my strike before 2/19

My two questions:

What is a limit price? There was one in there already, I believe .15 and I didn’t mess with it.

This is the reason I’m making the post, once I submitted the order Robinhood told me “your order will expire if unexecuted by 4 pm tommorow”. What would make this happen and I assume I get my $15 back if it expires?
narrator: of course he bought calls the next day, realizing that calls are not “touching” the stock in the way that shares are. and he lived autistically ever after
Potential wise: ARKG or ARKX
I wouldn’t read anything negative into this. It makes sense as he is a director on the board from one of their large investors. They sold off some of the gain to rebalance their portfolio to their risk parameters as the quick Tendies moved their overall portfolio out of balance. They are still holding a ton of shares and this agree GME to the moon
Bull r so fuk
calls
Please don’t bring that negativity
I bought 1000 shares too because my old man still uses a blackberry.
For some reason can’t help to notice he sounds kind of mad. I wonder if he got in on it?
Less liquid. Also a couple years ago HYSA were the same rate as CDs so the latter made no sense.
I’m so mad I can’t get this

I agree 1000% innovation and boomers inability to look towards it never mind for it, is why we make money. 

It’s absofuckinglutely ridiculous when I say anything about stock to my parents they laugh nervously and say they’ve put their money in Fisher Price money management and are happy with that. ‘Comfortable’ is the enemy of innovation and has been for years. 

This is a motherfucking shake down and we aren’t done yet. ps I hope their money is safe

Great stock imo. They’ve patented products and been around a while. Ammunition prices have doubled and tripled during the pandemic so they have great market potential. They have an earnings report in February so it should fly after that

No.
Oh it's definitely dumb. I'm just investing small amounts for now to learn what I'm doing. I just started trading options today. I believe in BB though. For no reason other than blind faith but I believe in it wholeheartedly

[Biden’s ICLN pump](https://imgur.com/a/uB3CYoN)
Not a squeeze gain, but definitely gain porn worthy.  GameStop Director Kurt James Wolf [cashed out](https://newsfilter.io/articles/4-form---statement-of-changes-in-beneficial-ownership-of-securities---gamestop-corp-0001326380-issue-8e27294cee4d739196be9d85647f2ebf) 810,000 shares today for $17.2M.
Kurt Wolf is one of the directors currently planned to stay on the new 9 man board. According to his filing he had to sell because his GME position was too big for his firm's guidelines or some shit.
Had the same problem with tesla. Currently still down 75% but coming back slowly thanks to some Theta fuckery and Aphria
BTC is extremely cyclical. It will shoot up spectacularly and then a 3 year long bear market.
I don't know how they will survive. Someone should start a GoFundMe for them. Fingers crossed!
PLTaRd here 1.1k shards 27 usd avg, never bought gme cause I thought we had to pick 1
How are you not making money in the biggest bull rally of all time. Last 4 years have been fucking straight up, especially with buying opportunities we have last March and April
A little late but the merger hasn’t happened yet, and might get a pump after inauguration. I’m in it for the longer haul this year.
$100 Limit sell for GME
>hug<
Ackshually we have it all figure out
Makes sense. I wouldn’t be surprised if they went through a SPAC. It’s all the hype nowadays
You’re not lying
Yes you are.
Most modern cars these days use silver so the demand is already there. I don’t doubt the demand will increase. The supply for silver should be enough in the short term so I don’t see a 3 month call being enough.

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/idtechex-explains-how-electric-vehicles-are-eliminating-rare-earths-301158962.html

In the report above, there are other rare-earth materials that are much more in demand and needed for the newer EV models. A lot of the supply is in China. I think these mines are probably going to be more of a need in demand and a stronger play than silver, but I’m prob wrong and f’ it 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀$AG $HL $EXK $SSRM

My personal belief is that unmanipulated price of gamestop is 90 dollars. That's not hope that's based on the money they made last year. That's without a squeeze. In short, it's not too late.
Blood red
Still holding???
Yes, speak up my guy. Did you get on the tendie train or you mad you missed it?
On the other hand he does believe in future gains cause he kept the April calls. It is just tomorrow that could be tricky. I would say if you get any profit close the position immediately and convert profits to shares.
40 shares, 26/28/30c 3/19 💎🙌
thank you babe
1200 at 18. Never Selling.
Helicopter money + unlimited QE + no interest + high unemployment + increase minimum wage 

Can’t go wrong!!

Gratz on people with BB calls

Shares.

Nice try Fed, this isn't an organization this is a leaderless mob
Fucking 👑
Squeeze hasn't even began retard. This is all fundamental growth and excitement for Cohen. You'll know when the squeeze begins because your sell limit of 694.20 will dissapear and you'll be loaded to the tits. Take the loss, buy the call back on a dip tomorrow.
TLDR
Biden is going to drive up on the stage in a Cybertruck.  TSLA moons.
I too need this. Last hour was fucking brutal
200 shares at $24 and 3 - $26 calls - 5/21

Any reason I shouldn’t be all-in on amd shares rn?
$BB BOIS
> I was under the impression that the seller will not be assigned until the breakeven price is hit. 

Nobody knows or cares what your breakeven is.  The strike price is all that matters.  You will be assigned if your short position is in the money at expiration, and at risk of early assignment before expiration.  Once you open a position, you are tossed into a pool of contracts that are randomly matched upon exercise/assignment.

&#x200B;

> What happens if for example I'm selling a put at strike $18 with b/e $20 due to $2.00 premium and the stock is at $19 at expiry 

You need to take another look at your math.  If you sell an $18 put for $2 premium, your breakeven is $16, not $20.
We're holding til it hits over $100 bc that's exactly what will happen
Well 98% of this sub is retarded so that checks out

How many BB calls do you need for 100k tomororw
Leaps
If gme hits $1000 I'll eat my socks, I will also be very rich.
At some point you gotta rip the bandaid off basically.
If in the money: you either exercise and buy 100 shares at that strike price or you sell the call and make some cash

If not: your call expires worthless and your money is gone

Guys I know it looks like fun, but for the love of god don’t buy options if you have no idea how they work
“I am NOT throwin away my, CALLS”

Not funny
GME $50 End of next week. Lets go baby
Depends.  Do you mind bill collectors chasing you for years?

wait its closed? why the hell is it closed on monday?
Lost so much money chasing FAANG the last 2 months
Congrats and fuck you
stupid question, why was he never in risk being assigned those calls that are that deep itm. isn't there like rule that 20 percent of calls get assigned? also being that deep ITM who would even buy them once he did sell to close. when he bought $40K worth of calls doesn't he have to have margin to be able to cover 100K shares?
You have a price target?
[removed]. Found what you were talking about on google tho 🍍
How so? Do you have anything to back up your claims? Big if true.
Yeah, similar thing happened to me you just gotta take it as a learning experience I guess, nothing that makes you this much money is gunna be smooth sailing!
Literally just downloaded twitter to follow you and set alerts on your page. Brand new to the stock market, trying to learn the lingo, will be watching you incredibly intently to try to turn my measly $200 to $1000 in maybe a couple months
Let’s get something clear. BB is not in the autonomous software industry. That isn’t their business. They are the backbone of the autonomous software industry. The leaders of the autonomous driving industry use blackberrys software to build their autonomous systems.
Is this actually him?
Source:  Privately commissioned study that took all this into account and also scraped various other social media platforms to understand the full engagement and reach of WSB in particular.  If you want a copy of it, you'd have to help pay for it.

At the end of the day, this data is just an interesting science experiment to a normie retail investor.  It's something they can look at and puff out their chest on a little.  It's useful for people like me because it is another tool in the box to do trend analysis (and the result of that study got me 100% out of the short game of any stock that had even a 40% short interest).
Gonna buy 5k worth  $12 March calls tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Those US tariffs really hit China hard, damn! 

Oops, my bad... those tariffs hit US hard...
I actually analyzed the count of tickers in post titles  vs. its price for a few stonks. Wasn't much of a leading indicator to mooning.

#WMT 150c 1/15 only .11 
WMT @ 147 and peep the chart
I listened to the whole thing and let me tell you... that was legendary!
Doesn’t always make them wrong though. Tesla might not be making killer gains but it’s still up insane returns the father back you got in. PLTR is stagnant but it’s up for a lot of early holders, I got in at 15 and have held through out because I think it’s got potential to go up again. GME gang has been loud for a loooooong time. And they’re being proven right so of course they’re celebrating. But GME gang knows it’s only just begun so.
You just wanted short term gains and didn’t do DD on an ETF
I think you meant 100$.
I sold 100s of nio shares for $6 🤡
Until $80 sound about right?
The puts expiring is just salt in the wound, and talked about because it's the only thing people can track. We can quantify how bad they're getting fucked here.

Shorted shares can not be traced back, but they reported that position themselves years back so we know they have one, just don't know how much. They will get margin called on this but nobody knows for sure how this will unfold.

Anyway take this and almost everything that's said in this sub with a grain of salt. But the fact that GME has doubled in 2 days and held while the only catalyst has been RC being appointed director strongly suggests whales are piling on for the same reason us retards are.

Tomorrow will be volatile.
If he sold 1 Million, imagine what he’s HOLDING 💎
Net worth ?
amazing.!!!!!....this is the next big winner... PLTR being held back & manipulated like crazy. XL also ready for reversal.

PLTR bones for all
Also bought this rumor! It's a gamble, but one definitely worth taking in my opinion.
So excited knowing I’m gonna sell tesla tomorrow and get into BB
So the higher the percentage the better it is?
I'm thinking of some July calls, maybe $40. Idk

Thank you for the gains Bro!  Can't NOK a winning play.
Any plays on CERS?
Agreed.. but all the data from the other threads indicates extremely limited short covering so far. And one dudes math pointing to a PT of $596

What a legend.
Sleepy joe better not fuck my 1/15 spy calls
Wonder what the average income of this sub is
What time is sleepy joe speaking
I'll be buying 40 shares tomorrow 🚀 🚀 🌙
Sideways for more than a week loses interest around these parts. PLTR is going on 1.5 months of it. People get pissed when their pick holds em back from other plays rocketing. That is all. 


Next catalyst one way or another is either demo day or the lockup expiration in feb.
Coaching would be my dream retirement job I guess I have to be somewhere else besides Texas
It will go to $20 by EOM
I was buying options. Is that what you are doing? I’m newer to this too so don’t listen too closely but for example I bought 10c at 1/22 for .84 cents but right now post market it’s already at like 10.60. I mean I ducking hope it goes through but I m using tears as lube if it doesn’t (doubt it does) 😂😂
BBBY 1/22 $30C
I'm not American. Your one-man 'happy China' party is adorable but not related to the thread at all. Actually it betrays your bias and explains the weird tangents before. Thanks.
You know shit's true when r/investing and r/wsb BOTH put a sell rating on the KIDS.

KIDS are 99.9% of the time poor investments that never pan out with any meaningful returns. A 18year+$500,000 investment on the SPY would net you a 10-20% annual gain. Even the worst boomer stocks like (T) would have netted you 50% equity + 18yrs of compounded 5-10% dividends.

Kids will cost you more that your initial investment since they'll require resources for upkeep, their high volatility will keep you up at night, and your first dividend payout after 5 year will probably a macaroni card. They are horrible investments. Trust me on this. I was one and I'd wouldn't recommend me.

Im looking to place my first options trade...I got $5k to drop. GME $30c for April?
885k shares were sold on Monday 1/12 at $19.99 and 90k shares sold yesterday at $31.08.   Those are already gobbled up.
anyone have link to bidens speech?
Limit sales set-

1,317 x 100 = $131,700
55 x 250 = $13,750
55 x 150 = $8,250
55 x 300 = $16,500
55 x 200 = $11,000

Total = $181,200

If it keeps going I’ll back $100 price level up. $100 would be just fine tho IMO. Some say it will swing higher others say $50-60.... I found a good middle ground and watch it religiously and make adjustments as needed.

Would be cool to know what the open interest on $40C and potentially $45C for 1/15 is. These ITM options will definitely have to be exercised by someone at the end of the chain putting even more pressure on the demand for shares

Guys don’t forget I’m a lowly retard now everyone understand everything here but we are trying!
How much did you start with?
Damn. Yeah, there's a lot of ways to invest it. Fuck, just bung shares any of the last few years you could have over doubled that.

I started small with some shares of shit I liked, then starting toying with options. I just had to do it to learn it. Reading about it and watching videos didn't make any fucking sense to me.

I use about 15% of my portfolio on options and hold shares with the rest. Any time I double my option money, I either cash it out or buy shares with it. I learned that doubling down and getting cocky will fuck me over
Yea that’s just wrong. It’s good to keep a critical mind while learning/reading. Good catch.
Yes this is the DEFINITION of high risk high reward. With a price floor of $10 the potential for payout is too great to pass up.
the higher the percentage the bigger the squeeze
This is the most impressive thing I've seen on WSB.  TSLA plays got nothing on this. The fact that you build the position in 2019 and held to now.  I hope I can get to your level of conviction.

Call the bank ask for an extension and throw that on GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌙
Ye I believe in the future as well, but I need the believe for tomorrow first lmao. Definitely gonna close out half of my position at open before theta fucks me sideway.
I'm in for monthlies. Sorry brotha
Missed BB or?
Buy alot of shares and calls... super undervalued.
Sell a put for next week and use that to buy your call back and sell a higher call next week.

Keep rolling your calls forward for credit 🚀🚀😎
Mostly shares, no YOLO.
It was me being super emotional, I know OCGN and BNGO are solid investments to hold for the next month but when I saw the -500 from BNGO and -330 from OCGN, I got super scared and went into the “what if” mode and figured it would better to cut my losses then but as it turns out, if I had waited a few more days I wouldve easily been in the green and over 5k
The squeeze hasn't even happened yet, shorts haven't covered, still got about a week before then. Depends if you want to continue flipping burgers or be the one throwing them tendies while yelling at them to dance while flipping burgers. It's up to you.
fox is for trumpers , cnn is for liberals and cnbc is for people who like tendies 💰
Average cost base that in, monthly and or weekly. This way if there is any major dips or correctly it’s not hit hard and you can buy the dip
Hahaha feels like it honestly

45k but I’m 20
Exactly. They only have a window of low volume to try and push price down and exit with. All shorts going to try and run for the door, driving price higher.
Big if true
Was buying a bunch Facebook calls that expire tomorrow at closing today retarded?
yes
The animation that season was incredible. You can literally feel the strength and the speed.
Where’s the guy that stole the stand last week, there’s another free stand for him
Can you recommend any calls if I get in tomorrow morning?
The market will be big for people wanting to pay more to live longer. Space exploration for innovation and possibilities of more resources and tourism. Just some perspective you can decide how much you would like to ratio
Bought 100 shares at 9.62 and so pissed I didn’t buy more
My stock portfolio is basically imaginary money at this point. Yolo

Exactly. Bunch of impatient fuckers in this thread. This is a long-term play, clean energy is clearly part of Biden's policy ([https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)), and that the market understands the needs to pivot to renewables for future sustainability.

A lot of idiots here have been accustomed to instant gratification rather than long-term gain.

TD Ameritrade I think
Makes sense and to a large part I agree. The only quibble I would have is Weedmaps. It's actually a tech stock that makes its money from SaaS. It's not an actual cannabis play like Aphria. In full disclosure I own SSPK which is what will merge into Weedmaps when it goes public.
Dude, that sound proper retarded. Cohen and buddies have seats now, the party has only begun. Current valuation at .5 P/S. A shitty P/S like that assumes falling sales. If the new gang turns the rocketship around then expect an increase in sales and a P/S multiple expansion.
so... rockets or no?
Hopefully it was to buy GME at 20 cause that woulda been hella slick...
I am fellow mommy autist in training! Take my upvote you.
For every 100 shares of APHA you own you get \~84 shares of Tilray when the merger goes through in APHA's 2nd Q.  
84/100 = 84% Tilray current AH price 19.38 x .84 = 16.28 APHA should be trading at if you believe this keeps up and the deal goes through. APHA is. trading at 12.62 AH.
Well the thing about making his money is sure he can do that, but usually how it will work is for a stock to really increase there has to simply be more buyers. It's the same way these analysts by big banks work, while they will have an underperform rating for a few months, they are buying up the shares while people are selling. Once they raise the stock by their "forecast" a few months later there is an influx of buyers to buy up their shares while they sell. It's been like this since the beginning of the stock market. This is the extremely basic way of putting it but once you become experienced you listen more to your guts rather than people's opinions. For the past year there has been a sharp increase in novice investors thinking they can game the system. A few have been successful but those are isolated incidents where they 100% put their cash + margin into one stock and it went up. But for most people, that's not the case. These experienced traders have been playing this game for years and notice the sentiment of the market and right now the opposite happens instead of what it "should" be doing because they know the market works, they spend millions to study it, write algorithms (fun fact, close to 85% the market is algo trading). When this happens these novice investors get "paper hands" and realize a small loss when in reality the stock probably was down only for the first four hours of the day then goes back up. I know one in particular I saw going down but the sentiment in the market was that particular stock was going up the next day, well I saw a pattern, got out and saved myself from a disastrous loss. You only get this "sixth sense" or whatever you want to call it when you do something for a long time. So do small trades and learn from the victories and losses. You'll gain more doing this and save yourself so much money than listening to some guy telling you to spend money on him so you can make money. I'll leave you with this one thought, if it's too good to be true, it's too good to be true.
Here we go!

Yeah I'm slightly against this. I have no doubt there are people who need the money but $2400 for not doing anything is too much for most people.

More likely it'll be:

Price goes up, you will say "ahh I'm so dumb why did I sell 50%"

Price goes down, you will say "ahh I'm so dumb why did I only sell 50%"
I’m going to keep it 100% real with you. Nothing that’s gonna be posted on this sub is a “safe” bet. Call options are incredibly risky because they’re leveraged by 100x.  I bought 50 call options for that strike price I gave you and it cost me about $3,000. I am well aware that I may lose that money and the option could expire worthless, but on the other hand if this stock shoots up like I think it will then I’ll be up thousands of dollars. Buy shares if you’re not confident in the play you’ll still make money on it, obviously not as much, but it’s less risky

I bought at 5 and sold at 10....
Go to my recent posts and you’ll see it
I'm a fellow autist trying to learn but I'll give the explanation a try. Someone who has helped please my wife in bed will probably correct me but that's because they know what they're doing, unlike me. Also I'm going to use different numbers just for math purposes. 

Let's say your bullish short-term on a stock called SIMP. You have $1,000 you're looking to invest and SIMP is trading at $10. But, SIMP has calls only 3 months out with a strike price of $15 for $2. You can either buy 100 stock or 5 call options. (5 contracts * 100 shares * $2). 

Before calls expire the stock is trading at $20. Your calls are now trading at $12. Let's compare the profits. 

100 stock bought at $10 cost $1,000. You sold the 100 stock at $20 for $2,000. $2,000-1,000 = $1,000 profit. 

You purchased your call options for $2. They're now worth $12. $12 * 100 * 5 contracts = $6,000. You only spent $1,000 though so you've made $5,000. Your return now is 500%
Does that include my 2012 Honda Accord?
Buy BB at open?
While true, they have bigger fish to fry. Just because creamer doesn't like us, doesn't mean we have substantial effect on the market. We've got a few billion going around \*at most\* and even then, it's much more likely to be a small fraction of that.

Thoughts on IPOE
I’ve got 20 calls @.45 expire 7/16
Once the squeeze commences and GME lands on the moon it’s gonna be hard to go back to boring +5-10% days
We've all been there I did that with RDGL @.15 dip, and its now .25. The best thing for me, that I have learned, is to pause and think about why I chose the stock in the first place, before selling.
i truly advise you to put most of your money in an etf (ark etfs, icln, hell even spy when it dips). only leave behind a very small amount to start swing trading options (small enough so you won’t panic when losing all of it). the market is extremely volatile rn you can’t really predict anything. give yourself a nice 3-month learning before you decide to put more money into option, or even shares. 

The reason im saying this instead of “GME 69c 1/15 🚀🚀🚀” is because you’re a dad:) DON’T LOSE YOUR FUCKIN’ MONEY
Because calls are more fun
Yeah seems reasonable.  I think there’s a few flaws in the theory.  But even if that dude is right & 1/3 of float will be sold... well 140% of the float needs to be bought.  So who do you think is going to move the price more?  


Also, I’m buying more.  Lots of other people on this sub are buying more tomorrow, so consider a good portion of those shares already sold lol

Not exactly. He doesn’t need bi-partisan support anymore, liberal policy makers control both houses of congress. Even though Senate is split 50-50, Harris is the tie breaker. That’s also why higher taxes in the future are certainty. 

Renewable energy spending will be put under “infrastructure” to help “create new jobs,” similar to the New Deal. 

The bill also has to be big because monetary policy (brrrrrrr) is pushing inflation higher. The dollar is just not worth what it used to be, at home and abroad.

ICLN is at the launchpad, it's destination is to the moon but the journey will take a while because they'll be taking the scenic route. Just sit the fuck back, grab a drink and some snacks, maybe play $BB for a while or anything else that comes along the way. We'll be at the moon eventually. 

**You fucking degenerate pricks!!!!!**
You can buy both. I have both. My 10$ calls for 1/22 which I bought at .39 have doubled. I'm expecting the stock to go to 15$ EOM. The stock I've bought I will hold longer because the company has great fundamentals and is popping off in the software market.

Lol I tuned in at the wrong time
Imagine not being BALLs deep in HIMX right now, cowards.
Wage control probably alleviates this to some extent but probably won't happen
Depends what strike I guess..
arkg will be $600 in 5 years
This may scare some people and cause a little dip but it would just be a good buying opp. I still see bears talking about the store closings as if that is a bad thing when they will keep around 5000 open and only close under performers. They are just shedding liabilities. My company is doing the same thing and we will come out with more profits.
Update please! i want to see some yolo prn.

Where's Hunter??

Anyways ARKG calls been printing bigly.
Why is everyone talking about BB
Yes they do have unlimited potential losses in theory, but the max loss is basically limited to the market cap of the company. 

Say they shorted 100% of the shares when GME was worth 500M they might now have to rebuy those shares at a 500% loss since GameStop is worth 2.5B. 

Even if Melvin owned every single short share GME would need to go up another 8x to bankrupt them.
Launch delayed by weather, had to reschedule.
Had the expected numbers accounted for the end of seasonal jobs?  I would think that the beginning of the year always had a rise.
wtf was that zoom lmao
Is ICLN done? PLUG being it’s biggest holding got downgraded.
Buying tomorrow BB calls, which ones to buy?
Demo on 1/26 hold steady

You mean 3/19 c at $420?🚀🚀🚀🚀
Hello, I talked to the Robinhood rep guy. He said there is no overnight margin requirement. Like if i were to hold Apple over multiple days, I only need 25% in cash even overnight. I just have to make sure I don't get below the margin maintenance level. Right now I have 75k in cash and using 60k in margin with margin maintenance of 45k. That means I can lose -30k/135k right, so I have 22% of buffer?
I gotta ask you the question that Tesla deniers always ask me. How do you justify current valuation?

Why would these clowns live stream them setting up Biden’s podium lol.
Whats your estimate on the jump after the squeeze has squozen?
Dont see any news..still drifting off guidance raise...but someone must know something? Wild move
Hope you GME guys get another 20% day tomorrow.

Rotated into the arks and clean etfs. Leaps and shares. Can’t complain, didn’t require constant monitoring and 30% gains over the past two weeks+ holding isn’t bad.
Well dang
60+?
is this the guy who is used for biden’s deepfake?
If Biden doesn’t mention ICLN BY NAME I’m never listening to this sub again
You guys do data-based investing? My investment strategy is 100% based on fire memes. I dont even watch the market. I have memes like this to tell me my GME stocks are so fucking hot they could build a second house with all the tail they’re nailing to the wall.
It’s lifting off 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Yo so I just read like 5 studies on low testosterone. They attribute the change to tight fitting underwear, higher room temperatures and lack of smoking 

BRB buying boxers and cigs
tax the rich.

1. physical labour tax, people who do physical labour do not pay into this tax. they are selling there bodies
2. home tax( basic income) every one pays there portion for this one
3. food tax 

these are called basic human rights and should be provided like healthcare and education
What is BB hitting tomorrow?
This has to happen. Board meetings would be full of memes and catered tendies. Fucking brilliant.
ummmm all of a sudden 180k from...60 k on wednesday mnorning..... the fuck is this shit.

True. I've been playing PLTR on and off. GME seems to me too retarded due to the business prospects, but fundamentals don't really matter now and people are making a killing.
Sell the  news
Lmao. #MeToo
That is a great question. I'm a stock newbie that got in around 75 with Moderna. I thought I was SOL when it peaked however news ive read is saying Moderna is planning at least 3 Phase 1 trials of something new towards EOY. On top of needing possible new booster shots every year or two for covid.

Better luck on GME during an infinity squeeze than anything else right?
That would only surprise me a little bit lol
former boglehead turned degenerate here lol
Alright my PLTR boss bulls!

What we expecting tomorrow? $24.40 or $23.90?
When buying BB is there a typical stock price action like GME where it gets pushed down throughout the day? Or does it not really matter when to buy BB?
If underlying stays at $63, it will be $17. If underlying is at 64, it will be $18.

We don’t need these fucking close ups, send out Joseph.

Is Biden gonna continue Donny's tradition of being late every time?
Soggy toilet paper hands eh? Live n learn you made profit
Imagine paying 200k for Education and calling it ‚the Land of the free‘ lmaooo
This easily doubles by the end of February. Maybe even triples. This IS NOT speculation. The numbers don't lie.
Y’all remember how the market would stand still for an hour waiting on trump to come late lmao. March and April were wild
Good thing analysts are more retarded than people in this sub
Biden is gonna go wildcard and talk about how fracking is good. Lmao
Biden please say Tesla or ev.

Well with wage increase he didn’t starve to death at least!
Congrats you’re rich
Risk tolerance is out the window im leveraged up to my tits 😂 But I’m up $600 dollars so plenty of time to cash out if it crashes
Nah, it was about $100k. He had to double down because he was losing tendies.

I'M IN!!!!!   6K in 1 account and just bought 1K in another
No sell. Only buy 🚀🚀🚀
You're suggesting that quantity wont equal quality by virtue of itself. Investing in multiple companies is hardly "pure stupidity"
Shares no calls maybe
Oh fuck thank you sir!
Not really
Okay dude, if you still want to be ignorant about the potential of GME with Cohen in charge then I won’t stop you, I’m rolling in tendies while you sit here salty af
Preach!
So if an analyst thinks a stock is going up to fast they literally will downgrade it.  Let that bullshit sink in.
he obviously wont
Cock and balls
The Biden pump begins!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GME Calls still SAuce?

Thanks
Definitely yes you can. It’s barely been moving as this stock is being slept on. Even boomer analysts expect it to go $30 and above
Hi there. Posts like yours are better served in our daily discussion thread than as stand-alones. Please try it there. Thanks!
Selling naked calls at the top would be the big dick move
For my money, I wouldn't buy shares... A retrace is inevitable in the coming days or week.

Calls? Yes.

With the new ETF: ARKX (Spaceflight ETF).

Taken from the ARKX SEC:

> Enabling Technologies Companies are companies that create the technologies required for successful value-add aerospace operations, including artificial intelligence, robotics, **3D printing**, materials and energy storage. 

So taking this in to account with NNDM being in ARKQ, its probable that ARK will buy more for the new ETF.
Yes Jesus obvi
Papa Biden 🚀
By ignoring the hundreds and hundreds of posts telling you to buy shares and April or later calls and buying way OTM FDs

BIDEN JUST MENTION HYDROGEN
What the fook are they doing
apparently they've got a meeting tomorrow and are supposed to put out info regarding their shift into software that could = gains.  Thats what some doucher on here said anyway... probably total rumor :)
DKNG is never gonna be able to get past this 55 level. So fucking frustrating to have basically traded sideways for 2 months now, all the while, seeing everything else in the market gap up 75% in the same timeframe.
Thanks for reading and responding. Appreciate it
Tomorrow will be good time to buy or sell 1/22 calls

An opinion.

Federal spending delays the date the Fed has to halt QE due to running out of treasuries to buy. As long as QE continues, until the treasuries become exhausted and the Fed doesn’t announce it will start buying securities, we won’t have a recession this year.
Limitless
been here a week and this is what I can tell you.

Their yoy holiday App Store sales were over 30% higher.

Now that increase was not because people spent more on apps.  It’s more likely due to MORE people spending money on apps.  The most big spending happens when people get new devices (they often get gift cards with said devices when the device is a Christmas gift).


Also their servers were bogged down for a few days after Christmas “due to volume of activations”.  That’s a bullish sign if you ask me.  

In addition to that, the inventory and channel checks seem to indicate a 40% increase in phone sales.

In addition to the increased sales, their margins appear to be higher too.

In addition to increased Q1 sales, we all got a stimulus (and should be getting another one) & every time there’s a stimulus, people buy Apple products (look at apples increased sales during the last stimulus package - they beat forecasts).

And with talk about an Apple Car, people are giddy about the stock altogether.

So when they confirm increased sales & increased outlook for the year (that’s the big deal), Apple will shoot to $150 pretty quick.

In short, GME 🚀 🚀 lol
Read the DD, watch the video and the customer's review and make your decision. You still have time to do that until tomorrow 😉

APHA is now 12.11
Tilray is now 18.56

If I convert 1 APHA ($12.11) to 0.8381 Tilray at its current value = $15.55

That's more than 3 dollars gain per one APHA share

On a more serious note, looking through your comment history I see you've been doing finance longer than I've been alive, so you win lol. I have to ask, why are you bullish on PLTR?

That’s what I’m wondering, I had a position at close but sold it 1 minute before market shut cos I was unsure how it would go, I don’t want to be left chasing tho
Wow dude came out early
300 shares and 10 $17c 2/19 checking in. Giddy with anticipation.

I was think $1-$2 OTM. Depends on price. I’d be willing to risk $100 or so if I’d get me several contracts.
fixed the link
I had my first $100 day today :) 🚀
Ok, you got me. Most of the runup was yesterday. Just topped off today.
Do you any of you guys know of a site that tracks stocks that JUST broke resistance? I use Chartmill but it only screens stocks that are near resistance, not broken it.
Would you recommend any calls if I go in tomorrow? If so what
Where can I watch the speech?
Hello my fellow retards. I just wanted to let you know I finally said screw it and took out a loan and bought itm gme call that expire 1/15 today.

4 mins late, ill take it!
There’s no way in hell that can happen though right? Unless they sign some exclusive deal for the KFConsole
congratulations! my OG investment was 510C 12/17/21 when MSTR was $300 but i sold to buy 1/21/21 expiry calls so its taxed at long term capital gains
Maybe, maybe not. I’d wait 30mins after open at least
I like it. Too much DD though. I’m in tomorrow morning.
Biden starting to talk
Lol if only i had the foresight to know that weeklies were the move. Gonna be riding them and BEPC for a while during this admin
Say you’re buying cciv at $100 a share
Hey you want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money FRIENDS.
SAY ITS STRIPE SLEEPY JOE
Hi, what are stocks?
Don’t think that was the point of what he was saying. Now you are 100% not wrong, but over time you can become the best at anything if you put in the time.
I want the drugs this man is on

Worked soooooo well in the past
More buttons = more $$
This would absolutely not surprise me. Or the very least RC and other rich people decided to piggy back on DFVs calls and momentum to trigger the squeeze this week.
LOL it's like they're trying to moon oil stocks before trump leaves office

Oh you posted on a seprate thread for your updates....
As a disclaimer, Kratos was supposed to have a "really cool" presentation at Needham that would "totally pump the stock" and literally nothing happened

I’m not a CPA or a tax attorney, but an LLC shouldn’t really affect your taxes. Both an LLC and S-Corp run taxes through your individual taxes, so it would be the same as if you had no entity. The reasons to form one of those business entities mostly revolve more around protecting your personal assets from any potential legal liability, which is just as important as tax planning. So I’d suggest researching the advantages of each and deciding which one makes sense for your personal situation. I’d anticipate an LLC would make sense for most traders.
“Buy gme you fucktards, that’s how we beat Corona” just confirmed Joe speech

Jackson Call you fucking meme lord you made it into a DOW JONES news wire report on GME short shelling where the fuck are you
Mention Green energy you bitch
GME, to play it safe.
it literally shot up 40% today
I'd guide you into my wife for 1 million

Balls of steel
Don't forget the earning release date has been pushed to Feb., after the merger vote. That news really fucked my exit plan. I might have to hold until the earning news if the price doesn't move next week.
Yeah
HOPE UOU KEPT IT CAUSE ITS GONNA PRINT
Thanks
Shhhh
LETS GO DADDY BIDEN PUMP MY STONKS
Yesterday morning I bought back a 1/15 23.5c I wrote for $70.   Almost didn’t do it because it had gone up from $15 the day before. I am a frickin genius.
It’s time for you to get banned you are pumping this in the r/pennystock subreddit as well

Is Buyden gonna talk about GME?

XOM

THRM 
PLTR

Looking to start a position in Canadian banking and American tech soon.
I 100% agree. I’ve never had the conviction to yolo my account at options but here we are. It feels almost illegal.

Good point. I got into clean energy to try and balance but I'm trying to hold out a bit longer to hopefully ride a wave when things get better towards Summer.
Gonna miss Trump's unscripted speeches
Honestly Biden livestreams gonna be so boring and on-topic compared to 🥭 🍑 

Markets aren’t gonna rock like they use to
To be honest, I'm considering buying 100 shares of GME and selling 2/19 40c. When I looked earlier today, they were going for $9 each. *Nine fucking dollars.*
I’m not saying they don’t suck. But The argument about tax is so dumb. 

Simple solution. If you don’t want to pay the tax dont earn the money. Yes I agree overly high taxes are theft. I encourage you minimize your tax exposure to the best of your ability and to vote for politicians that reflect your tax desires. Unfortunately this day and age it’s more of a pipe dream. 

In the meantime, It is what it is. I am not going to not work to earn 200k because I will have to pay 80,000$ in taxes. That still leaves me with 120k. Or I could not make the 200k and not pay 80k in taxes. 

Take it into account and it won’t be a 80k shock at the end of the year.
Someone hit me w a link to the speech

Who would shop at express when they can go to Gucci with these GME gainz?

Who?
Do they sell Nike shorts?
10k per week is going to take you 3.5 months. 3k per month would be years.

Didn't read, zero 🚀🚀🚀. Upvoted cause you're probably a 🏳️‍🌈🐻 and need all the help you can get.
Last 2 weeks has been tough, whenever I sell my calls, it moons. I sold my MARA calls when it was $11 last week, sold my SPWR calls Monday this week when it’s $29, it would’ve been up 500% if I just hold🤦‍♂️
Wow
Here comes the lockdown
Bigly up
I relocated for work in 2019, and finally got all my prior home equity cashed out in Jan. It felt weird sitting on so much cash so of course I put it all in the market mid February. I think my pension rolled over into my 401k at the same time too now I think about. 

In March and April I was a little anxious and kept thinking about those risk tolerance questionnaires and reminding myself that “I’m fully in the aggressive end of the continuum... let it ride!” It all worked out well in the end...so far.
I swear if stocks move this slow when Biden is gonna be president this will be long add 4 years...
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7rk6gypOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7rk6gypOM)
That’s the thing, I’ve been risking it and letting it ride recently and getting hurt. But this was the play that I decided to not get cute and just take profit. Hurts man but you’re right.
Fat L for futes
Did he mention GME yet?
Opex tomorrow could shoot up. If no one sells then they’re gonna be superfucked
Nope. Stocks basically being slept on and has little volume so lots of room left before moon 🚀
People use the phrase “sky’s the limit” or maybe “aim for the moon, even if you miss you hit the stars” so frequently that they’ve lost touch with their meaning. If you aim for the sky you have no ceiling. 

THE BIG SHORT SQUEEZE. 

Featuring Christian Bale, Elon Musk and Ryak Cohen. Movie poster is a giant gold bar with GME and the WSB subreddit logo stamped into it. Tag line is “To infinity and beyond.”
Gonna be tought to segue into gme from this
I shouldn't have gone in lol
$15 minimum wage can beat Covid? Who knew?
A longer term reference for you: my portfolio around 1999 was: Boeing, AMD, Enron, and Cisco. Holding that hot mess until today would be, um, suboptimal I would say. Maybe 1.5 out of 4 worked out. At least there was no worldcom or pets.com...
BIDEN TALK ABOUT BB POTENTIAL!
Please say free iPads for the kids Joe. My apple calls need em
This doesn't sound like a pump
Biden just said the US government is going to work with GME to make America Great Again
How about $17 vxx calls?
That's the move I would make if I were to enter within a few weeks for a short to medium term theta play. 

I'm too bullish to do ccs or csps tho. I suspect it'll moon or crash in the near term and I don't want to miss the ride
🏅🐻🏅 Biden 🏅🐻🏅
It’s true
I honestly have no idea what this guy is talking about
I see
4:20 West Coast - blaze it
Well set alerts on those
Yep, im definitely trying to be more cerebral with my trades now, although I have been yoloing small positions on the trending stocks in this subreddit.
So many 🤡🤡🤡 sold their GME yesterday to get PDT ban. 🤣🤣🤣
Oof. Sounds like 2008 for me. I couldn’t leave until I had a decent-paying job at 26. Didn’t buy my house until 27 either. At this rate you’re going to need dual income to afford anything remotely liable.
I read somewhere today that these were rejected and BABA will not be delisted. But do your research to verify.
Watch Biden make $TARD stonks moon 🚀📈
Front loading the investment would give the most time for compounding, but the market is hot. If you are uneasy about current valuations, you could put in less up front, and then increase your reoccurring investments. No one can be sure what will happen.

I'm no financial advisor, but with that amount, I would add some cash covered puts to the mix. If you were already going to dump it all in at once, you could at least get some juicy premiums selling barely OTM puts.
He’s got a roach burn lmaoooooo
my first investment was the day before the big gm deal then i got rocked by the report i was able to consolidate back down to around 17.30 currently per stock from about $40 previous
Spent all the stim money at the rippers
Haha you dont want my advice i am clueless, just got lucky after reading some of they guys on here.
The beginning of that saddens me, I had 200 PLUG at $4 and I sold at $8 thinking I did something amazing then it just kept going up to the now nearly $70 :(
TLRY Price target by the end of next week? It's 19.55 right now.
Buyden: buy GME
I think they are for Feb too
Jesus Christ, this guy needs space x orbital lift rockets to carry his planetary sized balls around. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I’m holding long, just shares. Might be a flat period for a little while, but there are rumours surrounding the building of a second factory, which is good news.
I don’t understand how you even unload a million $ worth of calls the day before expiry.. why would anyone be buying those from you, it seems the only option at that point is to exercise.
To the moon baby 🚀🚀🚀🚀
that's my mourner in chief   **😭**
At least a year. They're gonna fucking revolutionize cybersecurity and software in the EV sector

Imagine holding Amazon for the past 3 months lol

imagine pulling out of AOC - nope i can’t, leave that shit in spraying your nut all in those guts.
I wish I knew. But it’s trending up hard right now.  So maybe, maybe not.  I’m sure it will be volatile, but I’m not going to try and time this one too much.  What’s a dollar or two difference when we’re talking 50% change
Congratulations Pal, that is amazing.

thank you!  totally agree and reasonable not to release anything amid all the political craziness.
Ah damn
The shit happening to GME has absolutely nothing to do with the performance of the overall market. If anything a crash would make it even harder for Melvin to liquidate assets and cover their shorts.
NEE

what are you holding and thinking about selling?
This is gold. PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
She seems to know what shes doing - would yolo life savings in her hedge fund - to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
USO was not designed to be a long term investment. 

Google the terms contango and negative roll yields to learn why. 

A really brief explanation is that the fund has to sell the expiring oil contracts before delivery and then purchase further dated contracts at a higher price. They are constantly selling low and buying high.
SAY THE WORD TELEHEALTH
Please say something about clean energy PLEASE WERE DYING
cool
are you serious when you ask a question like that?
So its not too late?
Thanks retard
YUUUGE
WOOF WOOF
Sleepy sounding surprisingly alive
About what?
Will Kanye interrupt Biden???
Bought long calls.
Melvin doesn't have puts expiring (maybe they do, but that's less important)- they have short positions they need to close. There's a massive difference here because while puts can expire worthless if the price goes too high, shorts (which means MC sold borrowed shares) still need to be closed. A higher stock price means the cost of the borrowed shares is higher and higher and higher, and this forces them to close their position.

While puts are likely going to expire worthless, that is secondary to the short squeeze.
I'm aware. Doesn't explain why OI is zero currently

GME n BB gang here 🚀
Of that 0.1%...they’re on this sub helping grow their parents’ retirement accounts or paying of their mortgages and roofs. Hope OP’s kid is part of that .1%
Cathy used to be an outsider but now she's almost a mainstream.  Her warning might be influenced by WallStreet since she gave that speech after her interview with Bloomberg.  

If you look at her buying/sell list in micro detail, she's been buying growth stocks rather than selling.  Always look out to what Feds say about rates and trade policy changes, those are probably the important key metrics for us retail investors to predict what will happen in short term.
Haha, OK. Will I make you happy if I buy some $45 calls. Which one do you have? I’ll bid you up if it makes you happy. :)
God just get to the fucking point
no u
Any retards here hold or trade bonds? Bonds gang? That a thing lol?

Hey bro I’ve been eyeing BBBY for a while now, I mig it buy some may calls. Do you think I should go with the 35c? Also, do you think I should wait for a dip or is it not worth waiting?

Earnings coming soon. Should crush

But it's not [earned income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnedincome.asp) which is required for IRA contributions
Buying more GME shares for sure, definitely seeing another day coming up.

my dumb-ass brokerage firm only allows me 50% over current market price. It's so idiotic.

My tard understanding is they’ve been selling off a lot of patents and stacking cash. Plenty of speculation as to what that is - increasing their presence in IoT, auto industry and integration of autonomous vehicles, etc while focusing on data and cyber security.

Canadian Canabis firm Aphria just jumped 30% today on its earnings call so apparently, Canada and Canabis work well together. Admittedly, they reported a net loss but sharp increase in revenue. Once it merges with Tillray it will be the biggest provider of canabis products in Canada.

Sure do. Don't drink tho
I think it moons before the summer, but I like to minimize risk and maximize gain
Could you shed more light on this? How is it beneficial to hold for longer?
You have reached WSB God status.

Biden mentioned us
Short interest in 72 million shares. Float is 68 million. Tradeable shares. The puts where an extra way to make money assuming things went to plan. Essentially, all I have to note is keep buying shares on dips, bulls 🚀 bears BIGLY fukt.
Did Biden just call us out ☹️
This is not the way. They are incredibly safe long term growth holds
Give yourself some credit.  Your question was probably AMAZING!!!

🚀🚀🚀
WHY BIDEN TRY TO CALL US OUT, WERE ALL JUST TRYNA MAKE IT
is JB's lip okay
It’s over boys
sounds like you don't have an answer but yes why can't i ask such question?

Yes, there is a difference. "Letting the covered call expire" is basically doing the Wheel wrong. Close it or roll it, before expiration.

Bro just pump TSLA, thanks
2.8 Trillion total was definitely not priced in, Dems JUST won the Senate and SPY was basically at the same level
Flippin AAPL. I told myself I'd never buy calls again after losing a few months back. Should I hold 1/22 calls or cut bait?
There’s still a long way to go. I’m holding and plan to exercise at least one
Shorts gonna short
Really why? I'm a PLTaRd. All I know is demo, earnings, more contracts 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚🙏
“...and that’s why my plan is to defeat the virus with clean energy and weed.”

Just say it, Biden. Do it.

*Squeezes can, however involve large stocks and billions of dollars, as happened in October 2008 when a short squeeze temporarily drove the shares of* *Volkswagen* *on the* *Xetra DAX* *from* *€**210.85 to over €1000 in less than two days, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world. Short squeezes may also be more likely to occur when a large percentage of a stock's float is short, and when large portions of the stock are held by people not tempted to sell.*
5 hours at this rate
futures apparently like this...maybe?
This isn’t Mango with Remdesevir
I wouldn’t but if you think there will be sell off
I don’t have to imagine
How dare he say the word bear
OHHHHHH ok this answer sorts it out for me thanks for the response.
I pretty sure they will voluntarily recall.
Oh fuck.... He just called out Wall Street. We're fucked if he doesnt turn this around
Y’all remember when a cough meant SPY puts? Lmao
Did Biden really said let's get millions with BB?
Damn Bro ty all in.
USO was not designed to be a long term investment. 

Google the terms contango and negative roll yields to learn why. 

A really brief explanation is that the fund has to sell the expiring oil contracts before delivery and then purchase further dated contracts usually at a higher price. They are constantly selling low and buying high.
Buyden looks like a  🥔
lol i love how you are keeping tabs

closed those covered calls with big profits : [https://stocktwits.com/turktrain/message/271224547](https://stocktwits.com/turktrain/message/271224547)

What happen ro it?
Bro wtf.
Aaaaand the number is already down to $1,400, less than 24 hours after I told you that you weren’t getting 2k, and less than a month after Joe promised you’d get $2,000 as soon as you gave him a win in Georgia. 

You’re welcome.
Bought 5 AAPL 130c expiring Jan 29 before market close for earning play

WHAT CRISIS WE ROLLING JOE LEAVE US ALONE
Still, the last few months have shown that even if tech is here to stay, sometimes there are much better short term investment opportunities. Foreign, small cap and value stocks have been soaring while most of OP's companies have traded sideways. A bit of diversification never hurts.
sold today with 350%
You should just quit med school and trade stonks
this speech is boring af.

At least trump was entertaining and never put me to sleep
Wait till it tanks duh
The profit you make from selling options, is it taxed as short term capital gains? Thus meaning you're taxed whatever the rate of your income tax bracket is?

you know how politics work in the us? they literally do not. They own the house, senate (with the tie breaker), and the presidency.
Atomic? Freudian
I’ve only lost money on this shit stock
Yeah I own 120 shares of ARKG, but just bought CRSP when they had that big dip a few weeks ago. Also bought PACB, and am looking to get into more, but I’m waiting for those big dips that happen with biotech somewhat frequently.
Ay Biden can you just flip this speech around real quick my calls ain’t liking this
See how it goes tommorow, don’t get left holding, but maximum id say hold till next Tuesday after the long weekend
im speechless
same. I love mint for spending tracking and goals for my cash. 
Though they have a lot to be desired when it comes to tracking investments though I'll say I've liked the updates to investment but they don't help me too much yet.
I'd honestly pay for Mint if they let me make my own reports, alerts and etc.
Lmao this is good satire
Insiders couldn't have even really made this kind of move happen
Do you own any GME? If so, how in the world did you lose money
Who's holding APHA with me? To the moon
What did he say
Screw off with your crappy pump and dump stock.
Drivel is my middle name
Big taxes incoming? lol
It's all a several generations crisis. What the fuck was 2008? 😂
💎🤚🖐
Yes, no
PLTR is a platform, a suite of tools. And Palantir == Tableau + a data warehouse tool (like Snowflake or Fivetran). Just wait for their demo day to come. That should clarify their products and roadmap.
Big STIMULUS energy
When does Joe reveal his $1.9 kajillion Game Store and clean energy relief plan
Glad that I've lived through so many of these once in a generation crises
sleepy joe making me sleepy. get to the point
You sure seem emotionally invested in GME.  


I hope you make money, but your attitude is straight trash, dude.

"Today, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:[TMUS](https://pro.benzinga.com/stock/TMUS#NASDAQ)) announced five-year, multi-billion-dollar agreements with both Ericsson (NASDAQ:[ERIC](https://pro.benzinga.com/stock/ERIC#NASDAQ)) and Nokia (NYSE:[NOK](https://pro.benzinga.com/stock/NOK#NYSE)) to continue advancing and expanding the nation's largest 5G network.

Not now. Wait for the dip
Nikola can make you a reverse millionaire for sure!
“65% capital gains tax effective IMMEDIATELY”
Actually doesn’t sound stupid. Well done!
Heard I should keep APHA till this afternoon then it’ll prob tank should I sell?
Settle down folks...This is all leading to Stimmy for all!
Allow factional shares option chains Joe! Do the right thing!
You clearly haven't shopped at express in the past 7 years
That's why I was confused why people are reccomending more Tilray than Apha.

What am I missing? Will they "adjust" the converstion rate when the merger happens? is the .8381 conversion still valid? or are there more stipulations that I'm not aware of?
Oh come on we are not Wall Street. We now own Wall Street. Cramer said so.
Very nice. You must have bought right after he was on cnbc. So did I. 125 shares.
already miss donny pump
He could've bought Tesla 8 months ago and made 5 times the amount back today.
Did my part and made some $ on the old PLUG push 🏝️
Just so you know for DoorDash. Some people will tell you that’s a very risky stock with bad fundamentals and it’s massively overvalued. A stock like that could lose you a lot of money.
I’m a user and I love it. If they would develop it more to be the complete package from order to cash it would be unreal. Unfortunately always have to rely on other systems for some parts of it.
GME is impervious to anything Biden says
Looks like stimmy was already priced in. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Ima join ya.. but I do occasionally buy FDs..

Also, I wonder how many people here call them FDs without knowing what it means.. I wanna hear Cramer say it
🚀?
Biden is sounding pretty bearish...
16.8% in 2019.

Thank you for making me to look deeper. Learned quite a bit.
My $32 call 1/2022 is at 7.90 cost and valued at 8.85... so it's not great but still profitable
I started off making $50k in 2015 doing quasi-finance work with a degree in finance. Worked my way up and moved over to marketing and now overall comp is somewhere between $110-125k depending on company performance. Marketing budgets are quite healthy; there’s money to be made in it. Focus on digital marketing and SEO and you should be able to get a decent paying job out of school
You know I might actually like Biden if he wasn’t a dinosaur
Did he mention GME?
i mean as long as it goes at open tomorrow just sell it and secure whatever $$
There were more shares shorted than shares existed.

&#x200B;

What we've basically done is bought all the shares so the short sellers can't even buy the shares they need to get out of their positions.  In so doing, we've basically put rocket fuel on the fire.  Options expire tomorrow at close.  No shares for the shorts to buy, the brokers will FORCE the shorts to cover at any price the broker needs to pay in order to acquire the shares.  More rocket fuel.

&#x200B;

TL:DR:  Stonk go up.  Way up.  Stonk continue to go up.
I got my shares about 3-4 weeks ago when it reached $9 and then went to $6 😅 honestly I think still has future, a guy posted a long and detailed DD about BB this week, you should check it out

thats 836 dollars. Fuck my home country's currency has gone to shit.
Looking at the technical charts it's consolidating right now. $25 Jan 29 or Feb calls would be a safe bet
He's talking about ROI, that's bullish?
Why are his hands like that??
Literally nobody...only way I can tolerate listening to this clown is to hear about the puuuummmp
I miss that guy. Didn’t always agree with him but I do miss his comments
So did mine until I told her I lost 30% of my portfolio in a week in October.
No I don’t think I will
Biden ain’t said one good thing yet what the fuck pls
Hey you want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money FRIENDS.
What’s Biden even saying? 
Also, what’s the best SPAC under 11 rn?
Catalyst is earnings
The President isnt really supposed to be a comedian
He’s fuckin pasty

Depends.
Monday market is off. Tuesday/Wednesday is when it is gonna be at its peak.

They have a catalyst for 180 days once they receive approval for the new devices. So you could hold until then to see 8-12$
There are plenty of permabears absolutely getting their ass kicked.
Why are futures not up after Sleepy Joe’s money talk?  Pls fix.

Isn't ICLN too late to buy? Looks like it was around the same height it's at now in 2008 and since then has only gone down until Covid hit and now it's spiked back up.
Nice! You deserve a good profit! Lol

Hahaha are you me? This happens every time I get into a new stock lol
It's impressive, wonder what he was thinking when he did it lol.   Power to him
When a stock drops for no reason. Buy it then, instead of after it's taken off on a bull run upwards.

That makes sense to me. Thanks for the reply. Never considered VITAX over ARK or some other individual stock holdings, but I might shake things up. I wish you continued success with your business and your holdings.

Only in the world of GME calls does +121% look like the "wrong" investment.
Why the fuck would Joe biden even mention GameStop
Calm down you autists, "Helping main street"=Stimmy Money

It will be financed with deficits not taxes, that means stocks go up.
Baba mooning in hk , our leaps coming back from the ground !
Just say you’ll give stimulus so more can dump into the market. My god, GET TO THE FUCKING POINT
Thanks!
Instruction unclear, bought 50
I think fundamentals for GME are good. In all honesty I think this weeks run up is a correction, but an upwards one. Fueled by Ryan Cohen and management change, plus sales reports. And now Cramer is talking about us and even more join in on the eventual and ultimately insane squeeze. A lot will profit take when it squeezes, including myself. But I’ll merely be hedging my position down on the way down. I don’t believe I could time a peak nor do I intend to try. Instead Ill sell a small portion once the squeeze is over but I’ll still hold GME long term because I think Ryan Cohen could do something with it.
WOOF!
I wish I could buy stocks but I do not live in the USA .....
What'd he say
STIMMY BUYDEN STIMMMMYYY
Yeah, I noticed that.
Cathie bought 500k shares of PLTR today. Let’s fucking go!

Over 40% of the American workforce makes less than $15 an hour. If you think there’ll be some magical productivity increase and not the shift of business owners looking to eliminate as many expenses as possible then that’s your opinion I guess.
No
Too many people asking about the next GME, guess what it is still gonna moon even more. Plus, this DD and thesis has been legend on WSB for the past 6 months. Even if you were handed the golden DD from DFV himself you probably would not have the balls or the understanding to bet big and win.

CATHIE BOUGHT PLTR
Again no. Family is just weird when it comes to their money. If you lose... they’ll be upset. And if you win it’s not your money it’s someone else’s. So no
I mean to be clear, this was truly retarded.

But congratulations on the win.
I don’t want to mock people with less money but come on - one post is stating they now get 2$ a month in passive income. You could get more from finding loose change at an arcade.
She needs to come back with me that’s so sad 😭
Biden caught a case of the herps
PLTR 1/29 30c.
Currently valued at 0.69. It’s a sign.
I have the same calls and we have been saying for months to be patient. This short squeeze WILL be a longer process than everyone is thinking. Hold or exercise
It's surprising no one is talking about Planet 13 Holdings its currently between $5 - $6 a piece 🤔
Kamala lurkin in the shadows. This man is a corpse
How convenient
This stuff is all bullish for the stock market.

More money at the bottom is good.

Cathie Ark buying Palantir now! Good news for you Palantir holders!

Nah it's due to paper hands, my dad set a sell order at $40 and I feel a lot more people did. I tried to talk him out of it but he was happy with his 100% gains and thanked me for the top so it's alright. I'm still in it though.
Finally ARK bought more PLTR. Ridiculous 32 million short volume on GME January 13. Masochism is not the answer
Uh...cause Joey is a socialist?
Smart folks bought more
Does anyone in here even have puts anymore 😂
How long til Cramer says "FDs" on air?

CATHIE BOUGHT PLTR
Ok here we go. Step forward is to dump money in EV and clean energy.
Dumb question that I think I know the answer to. 

If I set up a taxable brokerage account and automatically contribute 1000/mo into a mutual fund, say three years from now I want to withdraw all of it. If I have been investing the whole time, will I pay short-term capital gains tax on the contributions that were made within the last 12 months? I assume the answer is yes but am seeking confirmation.
Thus why spent new car money on taxes in 2020 to convert a Roth.  GTFO taxing my tendies.
Why would you be upset? You’ll be doubling your pay at Wendy’s.
bro looks like we were cautious and kinda wrong lol

squeeze is here. i wrote $40 calls for tomorrow. might miss the big upside if this continues

where do you see this going now?
Joe giving mixed messages to the algos
All he has to do is say brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Yada yada yada. Just talk about GME is the future of renewable energy
This article explains it very well. Basically, you pay a lower capital gains tax rate for assets held longer than one year.

Maaaan, a month ago I said I'd join the next big thing. I even bought this shit, but then sold because I'd rather get some "real gains" with NIO. Fuck me again.
Powell or Yellen saying the worlds “Raise” and “Rates” together in the same sentence would trigger a recession. The whole thing is ready to tank to the ground if confidence in the Fed is shaken at all.

That said, I’m also 100% equities. Nowhere else to go.

Our queen is now long PLTR, you know what to do boys
Good point, apparently yesterday 1/13 short interest actually rose to 77m shares, on a short volume of roughly 53%, todays short volume was 30%, I think it's about to take the fuck off tomorrow. Going to wait 1 min after market open to see if it's up or down and yolo a market price order if up

HE SAID CLEAN ENERGY FUCKING PUMP IT
CLEAN ENERGY
INFRASTRUCTURE
HE SAID THE CLEAN ENERGY WORD
His reasoning seems...ok. I’ll buy more shares when it dips to 24 but consider that he’s lost a lot of money on his 1/15 27 c, they’ve dropped 66% just today, I wouldn’t take what he’s said too seriously. I’d go a bit longer on pltr maybe calls for end of feb and beginning of March
She said she likes it down and dirty
LETS GO
Cathy bought more PLTR today... never a bad sign
Yo Biden is pumping
>There's a ton of current and former Chinese residents willing to do it for free.

HE SAID IT
CLEAN ENERGY!!
Yeah that's right, you're not sure which way it will go. Some brokers will let you set a stop limit, so after the stop buy order executes it will swap to a limit sell for whatever you set the limit it. You might set the limit sell in that example at 120.
CLEAN ENERGYYYYY
Do you hate money??? PUT THAT SHIT IN $GME. ITS LITERALLY FREE MONEY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
HE SAID IT HE SAID IT HAHAHAHA LETS GOOOO
HE SAID ITTTTT
PLTR gang always squeezing more into the shuttle.
Clean energy wooooooo
MOOOOOON
What happened to PLTR?
HE SAID IT, ICLN TO THE MOON BOYS!
I started buying around $14 but sold at the first spike and rebought as it went below $19 so my avg is showing at $18.56 now.  Though I did profit on the first sale I only netted about 20% and missed the majority of the run-up due to my paper hands. That lesson was valuable though, when I saw it at $28 yesterday I said nope. Without that lesson I would have done it again. You should be saying that with pride! Most people’s skepticism prevented them from buying in at all. Also, think about the people who lost money on GME yesterday. 

I sat on the sidelines with skepticism as I watched other people make $ on meme stocks pretty consistently so this time I put $5k on GME and it has paid off handsomely so far - 0 due diligence, as is standard around here.
I’m jacked to the tits in VXX shares

Does anyone know of an online tool to see my portfolio breakdown if I only own ETFs? Some of mine have overlap and I would like to know how much of my portfolio each company is so I'm not overexposed. I could do the math myself but was wondering if there is a calculator.

Let's feed some kids, I'm no wimp but this post made me cry, you're the man. I'm surrounded by chicken plants here in S.C. and when I'm able I'm on board.
18 million jobs, bullish
CLEAN ENERGY
Joe is fucking with my emotions
Depends on the variants — mutations. For example, the new variant from the UK is much more contagious.

So, the variants in US/EU in late 2019 were possibly less contagious
dude honestly tho, my instincts were wrong as a motherfucker

r/investing and r/stocks get hate here for being 🌈🐻 but they have good recommendations for resources. Investopedia is always good to get basic definitions and stuff down. And honestly, hanging around WSB is a great way to learn stuff. Sure there's tons of memes and BS but the comment sections frequently have good info. Just don't get sucked into losing all your money on options lol (really do your homework before touching options).
Icln poppin tomorrow thanks grandpa joe
I wonder how big the font is on his teleprompter
My moms boyfriend said not to gamble the money. Good thing I can’t lose money on bb

Oh yea had to go back so looks like they got rid of nearly 700k shares of GME @19.99 and then the next two sales were at 31. Um if my math is right (I’m retarded) they missed out on a cool 7milly
I’ve been trying to decide for years

Someone should have made a bingo board...
I don’t know, there aren’t any 🚀🚀🚀
I think he understands that the market is completely unhinged from fundamentals and it will ultimately end badly for us all.

You'd have to be either retarded or a sociopath to look at all of this and not feel a bit unsettled.

If the full squeeze happens yeah. But I bet there will be too many paper handed bitches.

But then again the hype stock is getting could set it off and the shorts get extra fucked and we go to the moon
"We need to prioritize aid to those business affected the most, black owned businesses, hispanic owned businesses, Gamestop, and Plug.
Most importantly, they don’t have cable tv assets. I dumped T and threw that money into LUMN. I think any telecom that has cable tv or satellite tv legacy businesses will underperform as people drop their tv packages and instead just go internet. I wouldn’t doubt if the giant telecoms/media giants start to spin-off pieces of themselves in the next five years. And honestly, even with the iffy customer service, CTL has the best gigabyte service in my area.
Clean energy. FCEL to the moon 🚀🚀
This stock isn’t trading on fundamentals sir
Cause he plays cod on his ps5 in the whitehouse
Is that really Comrade Biden?   Looks like one of those Tupac hologram deals

I can’t watch the speech, someone tell me if icln is gonna rocket tomorrow
Where the fuck can I watch sleepy joe give his speech?
On the chart I see a long 7+ year base, a great springboard for a big leg up. I’ve had some other stocks that I bought 7 or so years ago that finally started to move again after a long down to flatline period ie DDD and GOGO. It’s BB’s turn.
It will go up with oil. As Brent keeps rising, this will rise too regardless of technicals.
Cuban is an asshole.

Build my calls back better uncle Joe
I'm looking at the same.
If I lost thousands in the stock market in 2020 can I get a biggie-sized stimmy?
Biden used stimulus pump. It’s not very effective
You've built up a strawman to attack me with. I never said anything about GME failing. Like literally where did you pull that from, other than your ass?
Sorry,  didn’t read this,  my eyes were glued shut....   don’t ask

Cathie's DD: here lol
Damn 100 million shots wtf
It can be for selling
When you exercise the option you lose all the additional time value you have (which is a lot for something in april/june), so best bet is to sell the contract when you're comfortable with the price and buy back in with shares if you wanted to re-enter
BUYDEN!!!

china owns reddit, chinese miners are who is making the most profit selling nakatomi's, chinese MM's dont want us to talk about it to keep all the tendies for themselves
When people buy calls, do they usually sell the option contracts, or do they usually exercise and buy the shares to flip later?

Is it not too late to go BB?
HE SAID HEAVEN = OUTER SPACE
Oh noooo, my comment became a 'stock picker's' paradise. I am an index fund investor, so I will never tell you to buy individual stocks. For me, risk-off has been the usual: increase positions in cash, commodities, long term T-Bonds (increasingly adding to these). All new addition to the stock portfolio since the last couple of months has been in ETFs with low tech exposure. Increased my international slice substantially too, mostly focusing on EM. Asset allocation is dynamic and I will change depending on current market conditions. I personally don't believe there will be a crash, a series of corrections perhaps. Great time to save and buy whenever that takes place.
Lady Cathie bought PLTR!!! Load up tomorrow gang!!
Nope. Still on the launch pad. Short interest barely changed they haven’t begun covering
Give it time homie looking at the charts there's a good chance it'll start moving towards $30 in the coming weeks.

Everyday I see GME gains. Everyday I don't buy. I'm a fking idiot. Don't be a fking idiot like me
I’m not taking the mark of the beast. Just say TSLA already
GameStop is basically clean energy right? Makes us more money so we can buy more ICLN

PLTR is right up his alley
1.9trillion DOWN PAYMENT

Totally missed that - thanks! And well done!
True. If we go to Pluto on this GME rocket then everybody on board wins & bears/shorts get burned by the exhaust plumes. Just dunno if this is what RC is really focused on atm, given he’s an entrepreneur first & foremost
Cathie bought almost 500k PLTR shares
Ark buying PLTR

Lmfao I’m not getting that zombie ass shit 😂

GME is innovating the short squeeze
Depends on your risk tolerance. There will be a higher federal tax on short term holdings, but if the stock goes back down more than maybe 10% it’s current level, then the tax savings are negated. Usually if something has a sudden boom, it’s not typical and will often result in big sell offs. What’s usually safer is steadier growth. If it “broke out” like you said, then I’d not be surprised if the wolves start to want to bank their gains.

Remember you’re competing against everyone else, focus on your interests first. Ask yourself what your risk tolerance is, and if you’re comfortable playing more Russian roulette.

Otherwise, if you sell it and take the profit, and it still goes up later, don’t worry - that will always be part of the game. However if you reinvest in another stock and that also gains value, then you actually didn’t really lose much in the end.

There’s really no right answer, you can make good money a lot of ways, as long as there’s validity to it.

Congratulations by the way! 🥳
He said “stonks go up”
Where you guys seeing Cathy buying pltr?!
Cathie baby

Look at his eyes dudes definitely on some grade A shit

Just say weed or Green. Tf
So, say GME hits even *near* the moon. What’s the timeframe on that? I’m not trying to be a paperhand, but also not attentive enough to hold onto and check a stock for a whole year.
The free stock I got from Robinhood is up about 200%.  CLF
PLTR MOON CATHIE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I sold PLTR folks get ready for it to moon 🚀🚀
What other stocks are heavily shorted that we can pump to the moon?
KEEP SAYING CLEAN ENERGY
Dump it all into GME or BB and start posting memes.  If that doesn't sound like fun, definitely not in right place.
THANK YOU CATHIE
Oh I’m retarded lmao your right
Nice, Cathie bought PLTR. Guess I'll re-enter tomorrow.

Biden just said next month he’ll give a speech on his “Build back better” plan next month
Let me guess, you missed out on GME too?  FOMO is weak with you.
Why couldn’t Trump just have some normal speeches like Biden lol he would have won in a landslide, it’s really telling that he just couldn’t do it when Americans needed him the most.

I started a little less than a month ago with Robin. $40 plus the free stock. It’s fun to start with play money to get a feel for it all.
You got to be kidding me because of Cathie wood , PLTR just went up afterhours.
I was telling my 50-55 year old colleague about it today and even she was thinking about buying into GameStop.

OH MY FUCKING GOD BUYING PLTR CALLS WORKED???
Fact.  Had some money parked with them for a year.  It's a sit and collect dividend stock
Thanks - I didn't realize you were going to keep the sheet updated.

I would say for someone like me I'm mostly interested in the changes - so increases by percent and also new positions.  It's kind of hard to do that with the sheet since it's locked and I can't sort without breaking the link to your sheet.  And yes I know we're talking about a few minutes of scrolling, but it would be worth it for people that actually use it.
Looking forward to part 3
Biden sound bullish af
I would look at r/stocks they are more for beginners/stocks to invest in and they would probably help you a lot. I don’t use Robinhood I use Stockpile but so many people use robinhood so you’re probably good with that! Personally I don’t have a ton of money seeing as I’m only 17 lol but I like to invest little chunks of money into big companies (Amazon, apple, etc) just for easy money. But I also like to throw money into companies that are newer and are going to do well. My favs right now are AMD and NIO, they’ve given me a lot of return and I don’t even own many shares. Just invest in what you like and what you believe in, you’ve got it!

Thanks for listenin
God damn, bunch of beta cucks on Wall Street.  What’s different from this stimulus than when Trump pumped it out?  Why the fuck we bleeding out?!!
What is the Yahoo “estimate” if not a guess?

WSB, let's get this dipshit Tyler at Citi fired.
I disagree, leave the door open for more retards to wonder in :)
Biden's speech is about future speeches.

Like, I get it, but after today I wanted to hear something to move the needle.
Congrats! Now fuck off.
Should I buy GME shares at open tomorrow or put a limit order in for $40 hoping to get filled during a dip?

One thing I love doing is switching over to Stonktwits and reading the comments of all the bears posting how they can't wait to short GME cause its ran up 100% in two days.  And I thought WSBers were the autistic ones! These folks are about to get run over.
I would Rick roll the shit out of Cathie
ARKW bought 500k shares of PLTR, hope you boys bought them calls!!
Most beautiful thing I’ve ever witnessed on WSB. For everyone reading this take one lesson: CONVICTION WINS.

Oh Its pumping. 🚀
This guy was buying Jan 15, 2021 calls 18 months ago. Either time machine or insider trading. Either way, props to him for making it work, but there is no way he timed it down to the day from 18 months ago. Cannot convince me otherwise.
Is that why it’s running AH?
Fuck the system we takin this bitch down and their money.
Wondering if I should sell my PLTR profit for more GME tendies??

Cathie Wood bought some more PLTR today.
Is there any possible way to set a sell order on a certain day. Instead of a sell limit at a given price just doing an input of a certain day, or is this not a thing?

Hey you want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money FRIENDS.
BB even though GME is booming..
 Because GME options have really high IV at this point.. few days of no movement will cause really high IV crush and you will lose a lot.
Fun fact he’s publicly admitted to liking PLTR
And you let her do a Sheenis

Maybe I have to work on how I layout my posts,  it there really are only a couple motives behind posting about a stock. 

-asking for a second opinion on something one is looking at. 
-sharing personal or third party DD because your Invested in The stock and want it to hit its potential. 
-you’re bashing a stock to buy cheap or are shorting it. 
-lying and trying to create false hype for a pump n dump

I just think with earnings growth, and that at least in of the tests they are working on will bear fruit. And if so, this  5M share company has the potential to provide good returns from here.

It better fucking pump
Merger vote is still the 20th and if yes merger 22nd right, I looked a lot and didn’t see otherwise.
In all fairness, I just deleted my fb and IG accounts, and it *ain’t* because I’m bitter about trump being banned, it’s because I’m grossed out by how far they let this mess go before doing something.
i almost bought PLTR FDs, smh   😞
The difference between Trump and Biden energy and purpose is literally night and day.
Been awhile since I hopped on a meme so goddammit I'm in.  AH stonks and callz tomorrow.

Ark bought PLTR today
🛸
I don't know if the conversion is set in stone. I think it will be close to an even swap imo. It's minimal either way unless you are looking for a short win. Imo I think this merger should set up for a longer play for me. I bought and will try not to pay to close attention for a few years.
HE SAID CLEAN ENERGY
NO WHAT THE FUCK. ICLN WAS SUPPOSE TO MOON
This guy held onto the call since January or something? I didn't check his post history, but that is absolutely nuts. I can't imagine anyone not having a heart attack, unless they'd forgotten about it.
I'm assuming that's including all government jobs?
damn for real, I thought they already covered 2/3... read it somewhere on this sub. FUCK YEAH

#To anyone who is new here:

Buy shares and enjoy the ride 


A lot of firms and people have shorted GME to the point that there aren’t enough shares available to go around for them to close. 

As share prices barely go up, the dollars short and damage they incur reacts exponentially.

These firms could be getting burned longer and harder than Australia (not making a joke)

🚀🚀🚀
Cathie is trying to baghold PLTR like the rest of us
After earnings which is yet to be announced  is when lockup happens
No. China's recovery was largely facilitated by strong public health controls. 'oppressive' or 'stringent and effective' depending on the propaganda team, obviously. "China has a lot of slaves" is an ugly truth that isn't necessarily relevant everywhere. But surely you are smart enough not to answer their supposition with something laden with fresh fallacies of your own...

Basically, yes.

If it's a cash account, you need settled cash. If it's a margin account, you need buying power and settled cash is one way to have enough. There are exceptions for certain special situations, like a vertical spread that expires ITM.

But a better answer is **never exercise**. With only a few exceptions, you shouldn't ever need to exercise.

I don't have a ton of experience, but once you don't "need" a job, it suddenly is a lot less stressful, when you don't "have" to care. 

I was a lifeguard in high school and in my 4th year of guarding at a water park, the owners sold to new owners who treated me and other employees like trash. A lot of people quit and they started needing lifeguards more than ever - so I knew I had leverage and couldn't be disciplined. Combined with an acceptance letter to my dream college, I was willing to quit at any time because I didn't need the job and I was only sticking around because it was fun: saving people, first aid, hot women to hang out with all day, fun parties after work on the weekends. 

At one point I mocked a boss and her ridiculous way of criticizing me (she didn't like the way I was using the leaf blower when opening the park before the guests arrived) and she threatened to fire me. I snapped back something like "I'd love to see you try! I know you're short on lifeguards this year - there's no way you can fire me - and guess what, I don't care! I literally am doing this job for fun and will never need this place as a reference." As a teenager, it felt so empowering to stick up for myself. She put her tail between her legs, ran away, and apologized later. She knew I didn't need the job and she knew I was only doing it for fun. Making it not fun for me would only hurt their business. 

Once it was clear who had the upper hand in the relationship, the stress of working for the terrible new owners went away because they knew I wouldn't put up with their crap.
Wait when are you selling them?
Lets goooooo🚀🚀
Nice try, cats only drive scooters.

But to answer your option question, yes. For me, it’s usually a debit spread going south where I buy back the shorts and then sell the longs at an even worse price than if I’d have just stuck with the initial plan.

OH GOD I'M FULL OF PLTR AND GME  


I'M RIIIIIIIIIIICHHHHH
I’m looking at dropping $5k on some..care to share with a fellow retard what you went for ? I’m thinking $35c for April expiration.
Astute observation. It's true you can pretty much throw a dart blindly these days and make solid gains. That's what happened to me when I literally just bought meme stocks and blue chips with 0 trading knowledge. Then things started moving sideways in October. That was a wake-up call to actually learn a thing or two about stock picks. 

If someone were to actually invest the time now into the technical and fundamental aspects of trading and investing, they will certainly have an edge once the market "normalizes".
LET’S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO

BUYDEN!
I’m holding. I bought them before opec cut production. Between that happening, lockdowns easing up, money printer brrring, and BP also moving toward clean energy- I think it’s worth the hold
I got in mid day. 75 1/22 9C 0.49 average. Already up 125%

They're gonna pop tomorrow might be able to find something ATM at open that's cheap.
2000 DOLLARS TO YEET INTO THE MARKET WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO

$400k in savings?
PLTR WTF... are my 1/15 27c actually going to cash??
Ok, I’m gonna say it, photoshop?
I would never use a stop loss for a few reasons:

1. Flash crashes happen. That's a great way to sell at 10-20% under the current price with no way to buy back in at that level.
2. Taxes. I don't want to lock in a gain when I'm not ready for it.

And it's worse when 1 and 2 both happen, where you sell your stock way below market rate and still owe a bunch of taxes for capital gains. That's just not appealing to me.
Where? I’m interested too. I saw many posts showing that it didn’t move, haven’t seen anything about 2/3 covering. Highly doubt it... the price would’ve absolutely blasted off there are 68m shorts
You're telling me. Ive been holding ICLN 34 and 35 calls that expire tomorrow, and Im down a fair bit on them.
think it's cause cathy just bought some. Email just got sent out.
MY GOD

THIS IS ART
Yeah I know but more EV = nickel pump.
Biden confirmed $2k more yolo money for us degenerates
I literally spent all December finally saying maybe this is the stronger strategy. Small gains are easy to grab in a swing, especially with limit orders.

Let’s say I swing 4 trades of +10% in a 3 month period, or 1 trade of +30% in the same time frame. I made more on the 10% trades, they really add up! Plus getting 30% involves serious DD, 10% swings are common in most volatile stocks. You should still do DD ofc, and also be prepared to study up and know which stocks to cycle through, but if you’re willing to do the work then it can be a nice payoff if it does workout.

Good luck :)
Guh
After 4 years of Trump im not used this kind of speech by a president

Biden better at pumping than Trump already, epic
Hey thanks I love that movie
!remindme 74 days
I personally own gme 

29jan50c x 2

15jan40c x 4

29jan39c x 1

shares

If you want to help the retards at 55cc you should buy 47c to bridge the gap but that's probably a bad move, if you want good odds/liquidity you should by 40c. But it's too late, futures are up 5% already (we're at 42). I'm not sure what's the best anymore. Probably whatever is closest to being ITM in the morning would be best, or a far off strike with a longer date.

I felt the 29jan50c were good. bought them at 3. Actually wanted to buy 2 more of em but couldn't

Can't really recommend anything. Didn't want to give my EXACT position because i didn't want to just make money off of people buying my options.
Dear Mr Melvin I can’t wait to sell you my GME shares at $69. DM if interested
I bought half a grand in $8 calls for Jan 2022 a day or two ago.

How retardedly stupid/genius is this? Don't know anything about fundamentals but...

* we definitely gonna open up by summer
* the smaller players are going under leaving AMC with more business
* four Marvel blockbusters, Spider-Man to top it all off in Dec

Lemme know what you all think. Trying to be less (actually more) retarded. I just don't see streaming as a replacement for seeing blockbusters at the movie theatre. All the homies want things to go back to normal so we can go see the big pictures.

Proof?
who's literate and wants to post INTC DD? 

Intel is the new Tesla
Yeah but they're probably going short at higher price points. It's like dollar cost averaging when you buy stock at too high a point and buy when lower, shorts sell at higher amounts to average out.

At some point they'll sell the top the way you can eventually but the bottom. But they might get margin called by that time.

I just worry the short interest doesn't tell the full story. Even if they are rolling their shorts higher, they're definitely bleeding everytime they have to do that.
PLTR TOMORROW 🚀🚀🚀🌚
Bravo
Chill broke boy. It’s not like you have a dog in this fight. Prolly buy shares 😂
TSLA FDs are a basic need
these guys cant stand it when they cant control the market
I love you degenerates
To open myself to ridicule, is buying GME stock wise tomorrow. I would like definite answers - will it go up or down?
I was in a similar situation like you about two months ago and used robinhood to start off at. Once you have a feel of everything and want to go to buying stocks past the 25K range, you should start going to a different platform for stock trading. Also look into what you want whether its short term or long term. As retarted as this place is, WSB is great to have an idea around long term stocks. The stocks I've bought so far were from this subreddit and I've gotten a lot of money just from shares already. Also avoid doing the whole calls and puts til you feel 100% comfortable losing money from stock trading. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Get robinhood to start off then change later. Buy $MGNI
Gotcha. But you could theoretically just sell for a quicker but possibly lower profit? Assuming it hits the right price.
Thank you!
No fuckin way
> They're now worth $12. $12 * 100 * 5 contracts = $6,000.

this calculation is confusing to me. Where does the 12 come from? What happened to $15 strike? shouldn't it be ($20 - $15) * 100 * 5 - $10 paid for calls? 

you buy stocks at 15 and sell at 20, so $5 profit per share, 1k shares = $5000 - 5*$2 = $4990 profit

Estimate what SPY closes at on 1/18. Closest to the right amount will win a special prize.
I’m praying
They say the best traders of a generation can switch with the market, the beast that it is. 
Theres a place where this makes sense to catch the potential longer growth of bullish but right now indulging the stocks that are MEME'ing larger gains works.
Keep the tech analysis stuff as a skill that will make solid gains when shit calms down but right now .m follow the money ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Diversify out of your company stock holdings when you’re permitted. Both your employment and a percentage of your net worth will be tied to its success or failure if you do not, which is too much risk. If you want to keep some, the rule of thumb is to not hold more than 5% of your investments in any one holding.

I dont believe that Americans are having a problem finding food to eat bruh. Lets be honest, we fat as fuck
Idk, there's logic either way: congress is backed up with impeaching the mango and will be for a while, thus dems won't be able to pass any cool legislation and green energy will stagnate and IV crush occurs, or people will keep hopping on the train anyway. You could go for the $0, no expiration calls as well, as I think it may be hard to predict precise price target and dates with a new administration.

Prob fat people they polled..
You can have your money back when you put it all in pltr
 definitely deserved, after you kept that one through the valley of tears last march :)

Since you made such good experiences what stops you from starting another $1k apple call for expiry in mid of 2022?
Can take more than 10 years. Some companies make it to billions in 10. The question I’d be asking myself is if you believe in the people and the company. Do people at work get excited really when you hit milestones or is it fake? And the product, do you see it taking off? 
I made the mistake of thinking I could loose all my money as it was after the crash and never invested that much in the company I worked for and cashed in 5x and only because of a takeover I had to. I knew it  would take off it was a no brainer but I had the crash fear in me and I needed my savings for a house. I would have paid the whole deposit on the house if i went all in
Saved me today...thanks bruv.
Valuation wise the stock should be at $200-300 based on latest revenue that's supposedly is gonna come out. Cohen (guy that turned chewy into a massive company) bright 3 other chewy members into GME.

So besides the short squeeze there's still shit ton of potential.

If the short squeeze starts I'm waiting for $500.

If you have no one to buy while its rocketing then youre stuck with it until it expires at the end of the day.  You'll take stock price minus strike price as profit. If strike is higher than stock price then its worthless and you lose your premium.

Up to you. I’m not a financial advisor. I wrote a skit about Christian Bale based on the events unfolding in front of me in a meme subreddit that calls itself a casino. 

That said, if you look at the DD and decide GME is only gonna go up, does it really matter what price you buy in at in 40s 50s or even 60s?
Up 5% in AH. I was wondering why the jump.
Movie theatres will sadly die because of movies being premiered on streaming app. Disney will faze out theatres and go make people buy their Disney plus rather than go to a theatre. Soon all movies will just be premiered on their respective streaming app.

For me its depends on how high it goes, I'm hoping if its confirmed lucid we could see nikola, xpeng or hell even NIO market cap within the year. Especially considering they launch the Air soon and supposedly have better tech than Tesla. I think Nio and Tesla have a lot more going on for the company but I can easily see atleast with regards to EVs. These will be the three leaders in the end.

China: Nio
Western + Maybe worldwide: Tesla
Middle East/ Saudi/Dubai: Lucid
Cathie Wood bought PLTR you all. We going to the fucking mooooon 🌙 🚀
It’s a two part plan with the first part (Rescue) being $1.9 trillion.

Tbh it’s the hungry families fault. They should’ve just bought gme
JOEY fucking PUMP

cue my absolute favorite comment of all time:

  
\>  You managed to lose 8.8k a day and your response is to post elaine benis  memes. You seriously have a fucking mental problem. Who would buy  gamestop calls? They should have never gave you niggas money.
wow

Because you can look at buying into 3d printing companies, AI, Batteries etc. SPCE is just one company who is looking at space exploration.
How can we get you linked up with a RH type app so you can visualize and research here and deep linked into the buy/sell screen of your platform.

Dude Intel has been sleeper for so long its going to moon now. Like cathie said, longer the wait sweeter the fruit
Holy shit pltr
Locking in profits is a good thing don’t let the people here shame you. Just get back in if you think it’s going higher.
Thx cathie
When did you buy these?
Thanks for sharing the enthusiasm. Was intrigued, but I was persuaded by all the negative stuff on Seeking Alpha. Major theme there is that the AI revenue is a small on an absolute basis. And a small % of total revenue. Also it seems their R&D spend is low for a co in the AI space. They had a decreasing spend in R&D for 6 quarters in a row. Co spent just $3.6 million in R&D in 3Q2020. So super interested to know what is appealing to the bulls, that I am missing?
Mr Buyden pls elaborate on Clean energy again 👍
Can't believe its finally happening! these diamond hands paid off! Put Cathie Wood on the board 🚀🚀🚀🚀
He did
To the fucking mooon 🚀
Cathie or one of her minions are definitely in here and looking at PLTR comments
God speed. I'm.trtarteded
1400* 600 has already been out
grey switch or neon switch ordered both cant decide
Lol did biden mention it
The word "journey" in general is a good sign to stop reading that post.  If Reddit supported killfiles, I'd automate that.
Imma miss those 330 speeches man

$BABA BABY
I understand that. 

I am making the point that short term capital gains are treated as taxable income. From OP's point of view - it doesn't really matter. The contribution limits are based on a tax payer's modified AGI. Since it sounds like OP is making less than 125K - they can contribute up to the 6K limit. 

AFAIK - the ROTH funding requirement is based on a cap of modified AGI. Where the funds comes from should not matter. It could be a gift, inheritance, selling an asset, or in OP's case from day-trading gains.
nah not now. He can't afford to crash the market. maybe next year.
Pretty sure he was banking in value play based on inventory. 

The console super cycle overlap was bonus. 

The gaming demand due to covid was a bonus. 

Cohen was cherry on top.
TOMORROW WILL BE SO GREEEN

It’s not hard to buy a 40p April call but IV is high af in both directions.
Calls on Kellogg's anyone?
He’s playing the game boys, he might as well have stared in the camera and winked after saying that. Only peasants would buy  that he believes in that now and, as we now, that was many Goldman Sachs visits ago
Ehh the first two seem like an irresponsible choice we need to make better choices this year.
You heard him boys. My man joe buyden going to create 18 million ICLN jobs for minorities. Get in now 🚀🌚🚀🌚🚀🌚🚀🌚
PLTR up biggly after hours!
GME 69 EOW. Ty for coming to my snek talk.
Mommy bought
Damn it, I came here to post this just now. :)
I need PLTR $40 STAT
Got em...thanks.
Sad that some people do not have money to eat when others can legit log on to Reddit buy GME and make 250% in 6 minutes
It's slowly back up
No. I really don’t know what that means please explain
$400 a week, what a fucking joke.
Alright I've decided
Tomorrow at open im buying 5k shares of a certain SPAC that is rumored to merge with an EV company.

Pray for me. 🙏
Me too @ 25. Today tested my will; here's hoping this AH bump lasts overnight
Lol what FD you throwing it in
If there is any meaningful amount of money involved consult a tax advisor. Generally though:

- Invest in Irish-domiciled ETFs for an easy life since they will handle all this stuff in a really optimal way (Ireland has amazing tax treaties for funds based there) but always check the UK reporting/distributor status (will be listed for ishares, vanguard etc). You can hold US shares this way without stress.

- it's funds/ETFs not stocks. So if you hold USA stocks and complete a W8-BEN page (and are eligible to do so - e.g. UK tax resident), you will pay a dividend withholding tax of 15% on US stocks in a dealing account or ISA and 0% inside a SIPP. This tax deduction will be automatically done by your UK broker. W8-BEN available easy peasy at your broker. 

- btw I personally recommend AJ Bell and HL as good UK brokers you can do the W8-BEN online with them too.

- Making life even more complicated, if you die holding a bunch of USA shares as a UK citizen, your executor must do a tax return to the USA if you held over $60000 shares, I believe. Again a point in favour of just investing via Irish ETFs (or!!! UK investment trusts! look at theaic.co.uk. Learn what a 'discount' is in the context of an IT. These can be like getting ETFs at a discount rate, depending on market conditions. 100% UK domiciled too, ez pz for tax stuff). NAIT is one I recall from memory
ARK just bought a ton from what I read
Biden announced that GME will be used as a Covid vaccine distribution center. You can also use trade credit to pay for the vaccine!

Why did I sell my PLTR calls!?!
why didnt' I buy more
Things look fucking priced in... How did spy not move up and up after stimmy announcement
If I have a worthless position 1dte for a widely traded trending stock, I always throw in some extra contracts end of day to try to average down, i figure what's an extra couple of bucks to average it down just in case news.  You will be surprised how often this works for at least a pop in the morning.
Cathie bought half a million shares
Benjamin Franklin as toilet paper
You better buy calls because $10,000,000 is going to be the new $1,000,000 pretty soon.
Lol go read a balance sheet kiddo
i don’t think you have a choice. #GMEgang
My sweet baby Cathie  🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I feel like a dumbass considering Biden’s infrastructure plan is widely known but I’m still waiting for him to say the words “clean energy” to see if ICLN goes up
2k total. 600 + 1400
Overall, perhaps, but as a "low stress" gig I'm not so sure. The work that patrollers do is very serious, and you're dealing with people who are having a very bad day. There's a reason why they have x-ray facilities in the lodge!
Should have done that today while it was stagnant.

But yea, a lot of people are expecting the Dems to pump ICLN
I have no problem calling cathie daddy after this rip
Cathi of ARK bought 500,000 shares
Space X is not a listed company
and nikola proved buffet wrong..
Not really ripping lmao
Guess who sold today
Got one $10 3/19C at 3:59pm after extensive DD (saw a post with BB and lots of rockets). Let’s go!
No wonder why it just jumped to 26.30 after hours. Better buy some calls at open ! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
If you feel bad about yourself, just remember that I threw 3k shares overboard at 23 yesterday because my self-esteem is afraid of success. Have to physically restrain myself to stop from paper handing winning plays.
Wrong call SNAP is dead compared to tiktok
I think SNAP is dead but they have a lot of business in AR compared to as revenue

The SEC deals with such specific and technical issues. At the level of the Chairman and commissioners, even those with industry or law firm experience depend heavily on staff expertise.

I see the role of SEC commissioners not so much as managers, but more to set policy and priorities for the organization and to rule on enforcement actions. An industry background could help, but so could other backgrounds.

How much money did you initially start with?
Probably won’t go through with the AH increase. You’ll want to watch price at open
I said I'll never not follow you 'tists again but here I am without BB and it up 80% in a week
Mother of God PLTR is already up 6%
 This one is the only one we need
😅
Let it dip in the morning, then pick some shares up when you start noticing it trend upwards after a bit. 

Thinking it might have a similar period to today
Lets say that the current average short price is way higher, lets say 10.
That leaves 30$x60M, or 1.8B in total losses on shorts excluding fees.
There is certainly potential for a squeese.

Also seems like the lender can reclaim the stock at anytime with or without reason. They just usualy don't since they rely on trust. Having your short position terminated at an inoportune time without reason must really suck balls.
Ill buy 100 shares after hours if you do.  Lets all make some rocket money!!!!!
They already gave $600
I also like Lucid’s plan, the Air this year, with less expensive models coming in future years. But releasing the “best ev on the market” in year 1 is SMART.
First time joining in, I wanna be in the autist club. $10k into BB in the am. 🚀🚀🚀🚀 is that right?
Cathie bought PLTR but for the holding I don’t have. Dang it. I need some Ark W
When should I sell GME? I only have 31 shares at 15.45 but I want to get on the $PLTR and $BB rockets soon
So if you deposit 8k do you get the 2k straight away ?
Bro sleepy Joe making sleepy
TO THE FUCKING MOON.
No clue, I just bought in because I keep seeing some decent analysis from articles and posts. I am considering using margin for the first time ever to invest more but not sure about the risks of that lol
Wow dude. This is so much better than I could have ever imagined. You’re our ticket to getting that hip hop money behind this sub!!

How has the trade war benefited us?  It cost us 60 billion in payments to farmers to cover their losses. China  has  a trade surplus. Another fine job by trump.

I would not sell though. This is just the beginning
Every bit counts thanks soldier

They spend a lot on lobbying, bought Gulf Power which uses a lot of coal. They fight against rooftop solar and hydro. Slashed their dividend recently. Allete has a much better dividend.
That was a complete joke
Damn isn’t that just normal shit tho? Thought she had been accumulating recently anyway
Publicly traded companies have regulations they have to follow. So unless you don't believe in the entire system, which obviously there is room for that argument, you should take that at face value.
It means buy GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Done. Let’s rock out with our Two Thousand dollar cocks our.
That’s my boy blue!
Who has the biggest shorts on GME?
Are there any metrics better than just short volume for seeing if shorts have started covering? It's possible that they have and new short positions are being opened at current levels and so short volume hasn't dropped right? Or am I thoroughly smooth brained
We have the best energy. People, very smart people, say it’s the greenest. It will rise. If you don’t buy it you can die. Like a dog
Being early is the same thing as being wrong
Correct even at this price it is still undervalued. Which is why most of us are still holding our positions. If Chewy crew executes their plan then this is a 5 bagger from here easy if you have patience.

Ship just started to fuel today.
I THREW 13k @ MMEDF IN NOV AND WAS UP 75k DIAMONDHANDED THAT SHIT AND DIDNT SELL ANYTHING WAITING FOR THE NEXT FUCKING POP

TRUE FUCKING AUTIST
Cathie if you’re reading this pleas buy GME
Yep, but I sold 25% today around .014. Hard to pass that up when I was at 1100% gain. I'm riding the rest though!
Yes, it's a CSP and I run the wheel. Except unlike the traditional wheel where you open a new CSP as soon as you close you're current one or it expires, I look for opportunities in different stocks instead.
Y'all talking about BB and PLTR but you know BBBY has a 70M shares short (61%), we're two days in the BBBY short squeeze having traded around 50M shares which OBVIOUSLY isnt only shorts covering... We've got a long way to go until all shorts are squeezed out here
PLTR IS FUCKING MOONING CUZ BIDEN SPEECH
Same - now I am not sure if i should increase my position now, or if it is too late..
looks like we launching tonight  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀** F8%K you CITI
GME up; SNAP down. All is right with the world.
An absolute gem of a video. So glad he reuploaded that after everything else was taken down.

I don't necessarily agree that he's proving a point, but it's incredibly entertaining and interesting nonetheless.
Imagine thinking you’re fashionable with your little cute cloth mask, yeah you.

PLTR is up almost 6% AH? Why. I have 40k in it. I’m happy but why?
If Cathie Wood cannot get PLTR to pump....it's not going to happen.
Where ?

PLTR just jumped from 24.90 to 26.36 post market
I did this too but fortunately had the "buy and hold!" mentality of orevio index investing. That helped me hold on instead of panic selling. Also led to a bit of unwise bagholding. :P Saved my account from plummeting overall, so for the year, I have some pretty decent "idiot gains." Finally learned strategies for buying in at non-hype, letting the winners run, and cutting the losers earlier.
thanks!
I am watching now but it sounds like another 2k.
So refreshing. Stonks only going up for the next 4 years 🚀🚀🚀
AAPL loves this mother fucker. Joe Biden for two terms bitches 🌙🚀🌓🚀🌒🚀🌘🚀

Lol you're definitely a free thinker huh
Video games! Would probably turn more towards board games after independence. Way less stressful heh.
HE DID IT TDOC IS GREEN AH
Smart
U got this fam
Stock is up another 25+% since this advice lol.

It's certainly a gamble. Doesn't sound like you've really vetted the available DD abd you're parroting old narratives. 

But at the moment all that matters is hoe many shorts are outstanding who will get margin called into continuing this squeeze action or who will sell to avoid further pain.

I'm setting stop losses at 30% below current price to lock in gains without getting shaken out on the way up.
pltr tomorrow? pltr tomorrow.
I’m not mad just disappointed
PLTR is special
Did biden say buy pltr? Wtf?
It is, with PLTR hype recently it can really take off. I expect a big day tomorrow with the after hours today. And I was thinking it was gonna be way more mellow...guess WSB has some crazy sway after GME
BUY PLTR NOW OR AT OPEN ITS GOING TO 30. DEMO NEXT WEEK, RECORD EARNINGS INC
I've been selling on my way up. I've already recouped my initial investment several times over. I may sell another 50-100k shares between .25 and .50 but I won't go below 100k shares ever. I think it's way over priced now, but everything I thought was going to happen with this stock in the last couple months has been wrong, in the best way.
no
i’m late why is bb ripping
Why is TDOC in ARKF lol?
Nice
I'm so hard right now.
In my trading account I literally buy stocks based on how long the DD is on reddit, I couldn't give a fuck about anything else. I haven't lost money on a single trade and the majority are >10% inside a couple of weeks. It's genuinely impressive to have lost money over the past year

I will not buy in, therefore ensuring GME skyrockets. You’re welcome.
We just have to wait for the GME gang to take profits and reinvest them into the other meme stocks.
Do whatever you have to do to get in $BB ASAP
$BB $PLTR and $GME looking up to our $TSLA brethren and saying “see you soon”
icln not going up is it?
This is the way

Yes 300%
Cathie woods bought PLTR today
PLTR!!! Maybe my 30c won't expire worthless
The results of Seattle's $15 minimum wage experiment have been mediocre at best. If an expensive and wealthy city like Seattle can barely absorb it, imagine any town or small city outside of the West Coast or New England.
Pltr has been flat for weeks, 5% got everyone so excited. Sad
nah because buyden wills it
Lockdowns mean stimmy
Ok I got the message. Investing only in clean energy and EV companies this year.
LETS GOOOOO
The bird is only approved to sell $100mm worth of shares this year. That’s 2.5mm shares. We wouldn’t even notice.

Cathy woods just bought 5M shares lol
I didn’t even make a projection, you just randomly responded with a useless comment stating that other companies sell electronics online, it was hardly a worthwhile comment other than to be pointlessly negative
Nah that’s great! You got in early.
What do i buy now?
Same here man, and a few April calls that have been bleeding this week haha. 🚀🚀🚀
Wow, I hadn't looked at them in awhile because they've struggled to break out for so long.  I hold some through a semiconductor ETF, but not individually.  The level they've suddenly jumped to in the past couple months hasn't even been approached since mid-2000.  That's honestly somewhat scary.
Biden has herpes
Thoughts about Twitter?
So?
Gimme stimmy!!
Another long dated Disney call.
Yes.
This rescue plan trash asf
Throw in IPOE and I'm down
so that's what caused the after hours spike

This is new to me, can someone please explain this to me? 

Thanks!
Don't fuck with us citi, this is your final warning: if you keep downgrad I ng stonks you're gonna hurt yourself.
Psychedelics are great stuff but def not mainstream like weed and many people still see them as heavy drugs so I dunno
What’s worse then missing out on GME

Pleas fly again
Sleepy joe so boring omg bring the crazy man back for some action!
lol
Yep
If the merger was just announced you think that it'll cool down here in the next couple weeks before the merger hype kicks back in?
Anyone else buying PLTR at open? once people hear about Cathie buying it, they gonna be spamming buy orders
Step daddy. Let's keep this PG.
💎👐
I’m brand new. Should I be buying something other than shares in BB?
>Those people, who have a combined knowledge of banking business practices and banking regulation, are probably the most qualified for jobs like this

Very true. Don't worry wsb this is required selling. Also. We zoomed past that price target so it won't affect us, double down!
So is PLUG gonna moon tomorrow or what? Only green energy stock I have
I’m holding
Ok SENS. Take me to Valhalla. I’m ready.

I got bodied this week on my first Tesla calls ever I feel like the dumbest piece of shit on WSB and not in the good way
$400 a week on WSB.
Limit buy on BB or wit until open??
American people live so far beyond their means its fucking ridiculous, and they call us the retards. If you don't have $500 bucks to your name, you done fucked up.

It's mooning because whoever decided it was the time.

Right
Maybe BB. Apparently they're a cybersecurity company now and people are just starting to realize it's not a shitty phone company anymore.
Are you serious?
how do you get these updates
Currently have no stocks. Wad waiting at 1.05 for it to drop just below 1 to invest and it drove away and left me behind. So now I'm waiting for the dip tomorrow to invest in. It will double dip 100%. So for me I will just accept the loss of the gains I could have made and just be grateful for the gains I'm going to make come investment tomorrow and seel on Tuesday
Dude, Democrats control both houses and senate. They can easily pass it.
This sub is always the easiest to exceed in because people rightly assume stupidity first
Let's show GME gang who's boss!!
Got Goldman instead

IPO  and trading fees
Why is it up so much?  I missed it.
Posted 2 minutes ago on his community tab:

 PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH $SENS.  This rise has no fundamental support right now, and I fear that this is a P&D. The nearest catalyst I found online is not until the end of the month. My community is NOT large enough to be pumping this, and I do not understand what is going on.  I posted in the interest of transparency since the chart indicated a buy to me BEFORE I could possibly publish my video.  I'm sharing a screenshot of my position so you can see my average cost. That is where I felt comfortable entering. I WOULD NOT feel comfortable getting in with the price where it is right now.  I will show you this same average cost and position size in my video on Sunday, and I will NOT be selling. This is a long position for me.
Finally to the moon 🚀
Take me with you Cathie!
Cathie wood
Forever legendary
Yeah that’s my though too. I foresee $100 at least so a couple dollars a share isn’t a big deal. I got premarket orders in rn
They spend a lot on lobbying, bought Gulf Power which uses a lot of coal. They fight against rooftop solar and hydro. Slashed their dividend recently. Allete has a much better dividend.
No day trades left and don’t have any positions to close on tomorrow sadly. Anyone buying and holding for weekend? If so what
i did the same by putting limit orders in today. wouldn’t hurt to try. but keep your eyes on it because it may blast past $42 and never look back.
Haven’t seen this mentioned all day, but I’m bigly up on XOM and also feel like they will benefit from this “clean energy” push.  As evil as they are, they were some of the first to research the science behind climate change (despite keeping it hidden) and I cannot help but believe that they have their fingers in many crevices that will benefit from clean energy spending here and abroad.

Also they pay a fat dividend.  $XOM - bull gang
What do y’all use to do your taxes and get the most from option losses?
Broke above downtrend line today
Pltr is on the move right now. Cathie bae to the rescue
CSP gang RISE UP!!
Fuck it I’m going long Bed Bath and Beyond this can’t go tits up
Been there too, the bad days you always think about what you could of used that money on instead. The green days make things blurry. It’s all a learning lesson, you’ll be fine in the long run.
wsb strength
why do we vote for old people
My role model!
I already don't like the "sympathetic Joe" voice
I dont know who cathie is and at this point im too afraid to ask
This was my first ever call. I really regret getting in late because I literally wasn't allowed to sell puts in time.
hey daddy say clean energy 3 times before u end
Really it means -5%. They always go down with good news
Ur beautiful
Build Back Better (Greener)
Yes but it’s promising since Biden is our president now. There’s a lot to say about icln but i recommend you do some research first before buying. also do some research on ARKK, ARKG, ARKF, etc. too. Your first objective in the first 6 months is to not lose your money:) Don’t worry too much bout how much you gain. cheers
Easy 🤤
That’s huge buy
Absolutely- the last couple days were just a correction.  The sqeeze has not happened yet
Sending more money to my depot and buying more GME shares for sure, definitely seeing another huge day coming up. Fuck Melvin and all shorts/short positions.
It’s 1.4k since they already gave $600
So was $TANH a SCAM or what lmao so confused
Fuck
it got added to ARKW
every single meme stock mooning except icln 🥲
Hell no. They’ve got 50 plus thousand 24p expiring tomorrow -

Which if you don’t know means they have to buy a shit ton of stock that we control the price of (as long as we hold and keep buying!) 

-
And as long as they can’t buy more shares to cover, they’ll be fucked to infinity because the short ratio is above 100%. They’ve shorted more stock than exists.
Of course Joe Biden is going to fuck this up. What was I thinking

What’s the BB play or any DD?? How’s this boomer stock booming 🚀🤷🏻‍♂️
He’s had a life long stutter bro
GREEN ENERGY PUMPDEN! WHAT ABOUT CLEAN ENERGY!!!!
From my reading on SaaS, too many players and they are only getting into it.  I still see them as a bulletin board company.  I think the best play in this very fragmented markets with too many small players is the regulatory side such as Metrc - if they go public I would probably invest.  

Here is an article that really opened my eyes to stay away from it as being too fragmented.

Cathie Arkk just buys the dip like any regular wsb retard
PLTR is mooning hard in after hours
This is my exact game plan I’ve 16. Started following ARK and doing half my choices with them now.  Half my own, which some meme stock and gambling and energy.
What does the fraction mean? I'm new to stocks and I want to watch wsb degens in the wild, and knowing the terminology helps
Yeah lmao, i guess it was already picked up by some other instition tho, or just pure retail bulls
Ima pretend I heard it from you first.
Higher priced homes AND a bigger interest rate?  Count me in!!!  The disconnect with the average American is unbelievable.
I sold my pltr at the beginning of the day and moved it into BB. Can’t be too upset
PLTR $40 EOW
>Did selling and missing out on big upside taint your view of the company or people who are still invested?

If Tesla were to peak to 700 (I sold at 450) then yeah I'd be salty, but even if I held I know there would be *no way* I'd hold past 1200.

When Tesla is worth more than than the next 10 auto makers I'm not going to be salty over a an unexpected and unrealistic valuation.

Compared to forgetting to buy 1000 shares of NIO like I had planned, I couldn't give a shit about making a 50% profit on Tesla and getting out.
I know exactly what that means!

2.5% drop at opening
God chatie is a hottie
Stock market is closed Monday for MLK day.
$1.4K

Adding already $600 equals $2k. 

Same plan that didn’t go through Senate.
BB is also easy to spell which is a real plus.
Stop trying to recruit into PLTR gang, PLTR gang is depressing.
BUYden pls say clean energy one more time
so the momentum on pltr begins. told yall last week
They need to raise the income cap on the stimmy checks. Daddy needs a new grill
Weeks.
Wake me up when he says fuel cell
Cathie bae picked up 500k shares
I don't believe anyone is getting swindled as it's retail on one side, and financial professionals on the other who could have looked at GME's surprisingly strong balance sheet/made another choice. Your second part is the general thesis of the theoretical "short squeeze", although there is a other intriguing long term thesis for GME
Pltr printing rn in after hours
"And I think we need more EVs rapidly - like those spectacular NIO cars.  Will CCIV and Lucid  merge already? Cmon man!  Last but not least, we need to support our home grown heros...we need Gamestop to thrive - consider buying some GME to support their cause."

As a dumbass who started a small business last year, feed me daddy!
That would be so cool, I think RH has some deeplinks people have uncovered but nothing for setting up an entire strategy or even linking to a contract.
I use Interactive Brokers. Look at them
Minimum wage has got to be the dumbest thing to do right now. With unemployment rate this high, who's gonna want to employ more people for that high a cost? And then he goes on to give an "aid to small businesses"? It's like kicking someone down then offering them a hand. Man I dislike trump but this guy's a little bit off too.
Amen. couldn't agree more.
well i bough  TRLY, ICLN, and VALE so....yes?
If this stimulus package passes. It would fucking skyrocket clean energy and EV. This in conjunction with a build back better plan is fucking tendies heaven.

Hi there. The mod team has determined that your post violates rule #3:

Already is. 5M buy order for ARKW

In this market!? If RC becomes CEO at the June shareholder's meeting, or even just chairman, lays out a grand vision for remaking the business, takes some of the debt off the books and gets credit upgrades, FOMO both retail and institutional could definitely take this to $200 by christmas.
Cathie with the PLTR buy. Thank you!
R u fucking serious
Thanks man!
$500
Can't go tits up
For your own sake, please be careful and follow the sound advice that's been given to you.

Very rarely do WSB give this advice, we seriously don't want you to lose it all.

I would avoid options full stop. Trade shares with 10K to get a feel for the market, it won't be the end of the world even if you manage to blow that up.

Do NOT make big trades when you quite clearly have a lot of learning to do. Trading isn't as simple as looking at past charts and thinking it'll go back up.
Only if you are a gay bear
If amc announces it has managed to raise enough money to stay solvent through 2021, I'll probably buy a chunk and see where it goes. It's price is basically as cheap as it will ever be at this point. Assuming it doesn't go under lol
If i use margin to day trade on RH but return it before end of trading day. Do i pay interest?
I saw the P/E was a measly 10... that's a normal 10x valuation during the most retarded bull run in history. P/E 100 puts shares at $600 and makes me a millionaire. 

House on the hills or BUST. See you all in a year.
Biden said "old mobile telecommunications companies which have pivoted from outdated hardware to 5G network infrastructure"...

sounds like NOK....
Holy fuck- just curious where do you get this information?

You need to have enough capital to be able to buy 100 shares of the stock at whatever strike price you sold at
Got me some head on the back row many times. And because of those delightful memories, I'M IN.
wont stop deflation
how could you possibly have missed out on GME? 99% of this sub has been spamming it every day for literally 6 months saying to buy.
Get shares
Look at $MAXR aswell
"are rescue plan will provide stonks with the capital required to get to new heights, courtesy of J Pow's printer going into BRRRRRRRRRRR overdrive" 💦💦💦
Please let this PLTR pump be real
honestly this is better than I expected, the sentiment is hope and moving forward and also making sure Americans can afford to enjoy the transition back to normal life

this mixed with low interest rates into possibly 2023 but absolutely for the rest of the year is gonna be hella good for the market

This is true of course, in hindsight.

At the time in March, people were afraid we could have been entering into a new depression and could have stayed at those levels, or went even lower, for a much longer period of time.

Or basically, we don't know. Hence the risk rating

It’s going to depend on the retard strength of WSB over the next week / tomorrow.
Not gonna lie. Kinda wish I bought monday spy calls.... I feel like tomorrow will be sideways, and Tuesday will be up
So what's your expectation on the price? Looks like it would reach 50 within next week?

I'm thinking a 10-15% pullback by the end of February, maybe once we know more about Biden's policies (capital gains taxes?), or perhaps it won't even require a catalyst. Only then will I buy -- I'm 95% cash until then. For what it's worth, also seeing a lot of analysts predict SPY will peak in April, correct, then trade flat to down for the rest of the year. I just received a lot of money in inheritance too, and don't even want to put it in. I find the thought of long-term investing in this environment / at this level to be terrifying.
I sold 350 shares of PLTR to buy 1000 shares of GOEV FUCK ME lol

I'm doing something wrong. I bought a call on IWM delta is 0.5801 price is 214.05 and the option is worth 2441. Why am I getting a negative 0.949 value for leverage?
I agree but people also make poor choices when it comes to what they eat. I know people that only drink juice/soda instead of water. Little choices like eating wheat bread etc. I know that unhealthy food is usually less expensive but sometimes its all about making the better choices when we can.
That purchase was on ARK W
Watch Beijing Biden push EV by saying NIO never had a recall
Good idea to buy PLTR at open?
I'm relieved that he won. No longer fighting for the rich man.

How is the market going to react to the minimum wage increase news?
And they call us Europoors
Obviously you should sell gme when it dips, and buy pltr on top. Have you not followed this sub at all?
That's correct, if you're passive and just going along with company structures. The point of highlighting your own accomplishments is to differentiate you from coworkers and plant a seed in your manager's head before you go to them and ask about the path for promotion.

Personal anecdote: I have managed multiple people, and I tried to reward them appropriately for their contributions. But the ones I actually went to bat for, gave them opportunities to try new things, actively worked with them on growing their careers? They came to me first.
What if he ends the speech by just saying all of our meme tickers, and then drops the mic and walks off the stage.
Make sure to use that app deal for the free large fries. Life changer
You’ve nailed it. I’ve been searching and reflecting through these gains, mine and others, for the past year or so. The probability of gaining 6/10% vs 20+% is ridiculous. The problem is greed. Often stocks have their ATR and you will gain 8% in a day and you will hold waiting for the target 10.

The more frequently you take small profits the more you can compound gains. I have done in the region of 60 trades with an average return of 6%. 

The real problem is greed and win porn of 1000%. 

I will be here in 10 years making my small gains. The big gainer will be out and bored.
Why GME short interest so high? Isn’t shorting GME illegal?
Saw this too! Moon mission to demo day 🚀🚀🚀
Which part of it?

Why do you think that MJ has made a whooping +19% return over the last year, while YOLO made +95%? Hell MJ is trailing 10% of YOLO and MSOS over the last 3 months and its basically been money falling out of the sky.
$BB, sorry guys
Shares over calls?
Joe I need you to roll a blunt right now do it just face the camera and do it
Keeping rates near 0 and printing unlimited amounts of money isn’t going to lead to a crash. It’s going to lead to an explosion.   We are devaluing our dollar to nothing, so those gains mean nothing when it’s in USD and the purchasing power of that dollar continues to crumble.  Just one mans opinion.
You'll be living rent free in my memory you basterd

We going to end the war on drugs by legalizing weed. Yeeeeaaaaah
I'm legit so sick of this sub. Is there a stocks sub that requires you to actually do some research or reading before blindly going into investing and freaking out or celebrating?

Fucking amazing, long live PLTR!

Yay barely still young!
I love/hate seeing these.  

Fuck you and you’re the man
Still over 2 months to ARKX, no need to rush the sale of a stock that is itching to break out in 2 weeks.
So serious daddy
Ur done
Apple pleas go up
Next 5 to 10 years
Stocks only go up. So I guess 100$
Wow. I posted this 35 minutes before takeoff...
How fucking poetic it would be for Cathie to come and rescue all of the palantards in here
My DUDE!
2k stimmy from Buyden and $600 stimmy from Trump, did I hear this right?
Evil sounds good..... I'm in! 🥳
1,000,000 Zimbabwe dollars
Why is Pltr mooning??
Help a brother out
I mean... you're still retarded.
Already thinking about the type of sauce imma dip my tendies in thanks to these PLTR calls.
No, i’m a fucking degen
It's not going through options only trade during market hours
The market is closed on Monday.
I wish she could find a way to invest in SpaceX
Love SPCE I made 8k on that stock from Mid November until the Friday before the test flight.
Aunt Cathie heard your prayers and she took a position on PLTR. Be patient and let her take care of you 🚀🚀🚀
This is a central inverter. Enphase focuses on micro-inverters. Enphase will be fine.

Very true that’s my thought as well. I think I’ll just go with open to make sure I get filled. A couple dollars a share either way doesn’t make much difference when we’re in triple digits
If Cathie keeps printing me money I'm going to have to create a shrine to her in my closet
Hope you aren’t white.
Oh shit! Haha no, no, no. I've only made half what I made last year, so my first time playing the stocks is with only a handful of shares, 2 of which are GME.
Woah he has a plan? Investors impressed already 🚀
$50 Fair value for GME? Been selling FD puts on the runup. Thinking about selling longer dated ones cause IV is so high
Rapping is hard I'd rather check my phone a hundred times a day so I can make my 3% after taxes
Mama
Yo Biden if you wanna help people in poverty so bad pump green energy
Young is always whatever age below whoever's judging it
ARKW half million today 💦
My kid was the reason I started trading tho
its been going on so long, I am not sure it will make a difference. the demand to see audits is not new. also Gold is as much a criminal enterprise in being manipulated. the most likely outcome imo is that the criminality will be taken over by the powers-that-be and will carry on in the crypto space. there is too much money and institutional involvement to uncover the rot without big damage, better to take it over.
Ok, let me put it another way:

You've made nearly $2,000,000 in TSLA stocks. Sell around half of it now and you get a guaranteed $1,000,000. For most people, that's already a life-changing amount of money. Let's say stocks rise by 10x in the near future. You'd have $10,000,000 at that point... or, if you were wrong, you'd still have $1,000,000 to fall back on. If you stayed all in, you'd have $20,000,000... or, if you were wrong, you'd have $0 and a lot of regrets. There's not much of a difference practically between $20,000,000 and $10,000,000, you're rich as fuck either way, but there's a huge difference between $1,000,000 and $0.

Obviously this is all simplified and exaggerated, but I hope you get my point. You've gotten an opportunity most could never dream of, don't risk it all because you "really believe in" a company. For the record, I agree with you that Tesla will likely keep growing, but with so much money on the line that's not a risk you should be taking.
I’m stackin 20 dec 23 calls while they’re cheap
Lol Republicans who didn't vote for the $2k stimulus must be kicking themselves now.


Good job guys. Cost you $2 trillion so far and we ended up getting it anyway. Was it worth it?
How do you do that? I can't find how. I have gold
I dont think anything happened.
IPOE will become SOFI after merger.
Anyone else noticed he sounded like Trump for a second?
It’s just a fancy term for “do your Google’s”
I took my GME profits this morning and rolled them into more PLTR shares and leaps. Feeling pretty big-brain right now.
Biden needs a red Bull or something
Imagine thinking raising the minimum wage to $15 wouldn’t crush the already devastated small businesses who already can’t pay their employees
If you've been investing in the same market as me since march you are really bad
“Woman get back to work” LOL
Nooooooo! Wiggz!
What do you think about direction from here since macros are mostly priced in? 

15 dollars for wages at once may strike the inflation up in the near future.  I guess we shall see.
All they way until next week.
Also many catalysts for future. One of them is in the approval and more in tbe testing.
GME all the way 🚀🚀🚀🚀

This is excellent. Well done mods.  

That was a ridiculous thread.
Nope. Can't think of one fitting that description.
There absolutely is potential. It’s 1.8b now at $40 ($42 in AH). If it jumps to 50 tomorrow, that’s 2.4b.... The thing that makes this case so special is there are more shorts than the float... when it starts, then there’s no knowing where it actually ends.

worth noting it's in Spotify ToS it is to be used personally only and not for commercial use, but I have never worked for a restaurant that used anything other than spotify or pandora. That 9/month is meant to cover 1 user's listening and not 500+ people a night in some bars - artists are the one's getting boned by this. Spotify doesn't pursue because they still make money, artists miss out on an incalculable amount of royalties.
Yeah I'm fucking pissed
Yo I followed this post earlier this morning and my FUCKING CALLS ARE UP 2000$.

And rather than address the issue our politicians go here’s more money to blow on things you don’t need!
Yes, she’s up to almost 2 million shares in arkw. Will be interesting to see if she keeps adding next few days.  It’s only a matter of time!

from 50k to 7mil and beyond. this is king shit!

PLTR TO 69.42 LETS GO

Doesn’t happen often for me.

Sure... that's why your currency has fallen like 10% compared to mine during the last 8 months.
ARKW bought in today. Cathie loves us!!
Funny I was banned from this sub for calling out his blatant lies and untruths. Tweety birds and Goldie friends and boastful gains for trades that didn’t exist and views that no one with credible science or medical backgrounds could ascribe to. And then of course the chicken little reaction to pandemic and then revisionist history post bounce by deleting their history. 
Saw lots like them on Twitter, including the meme’d “moving to Mexico”.
More money => more spending => Stock Prices soar

As for how it changes the value of the US dollar. Who cares you’ll be rolling in cash.
The rule is if you need the money within 5 years, don't invest it in the stock market.

https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/101

Ben Felix explained it in one of his podcasts. Timestamp at 31:49. The 0.38% number is at timestamp 38:32.

By not having all of your money tied to the stock market at T+0, you aren't efficiently capturing the rise of the market as a whole. This results in underperformance of your portfolio compared to the market. 

He looked at 10-year rolling periods (Jan 1970 - Jan 1980, Feb 1970 - Feb 1980, etc), individually in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, UK, and the US, of 100% equity portfolios. DCA was done with $1 million over 12 months. 

On average, the annual growth of the DCA portfolio trailed the lump sum portfolio by 0.38%.

*He also looked at bear markets (20% drop) and bull markets (95% of highest P/E ratios), and lump sum still beat DCA >50% of the time.
just curious what do yall use to watch prices AH? I use business insider but I feel like there has to be a better chart somewhere

HE SAID BATTERY TECHNOLOGY AND CLEAN ENERGY PUMPPPPP
What did you call me?
It wont unless they get rid of the filibuster
I'm glad you're saying this, I've been buying a 'lil bit of AMD roughly once-a-day when seeing it discounted. 

Even if the bounce doesn't spring itself immediately, the worst-case scenario is just holding until announcements and releases nudge it back up, so why not?
l o w e n e r g y
He hasn't mentioned item one about GME or TSLA and I say - Why?
YAAAAASSSS HE SAID BATTERY TECHNOLOGY!
He said it!!!!
I'm watching it through these comments
The amount of time spent typing your question could have been spent searching GME with dd flair in this sub. 

I could give you shorter version: because: 🚀🚀🚀🚀
>	What happens then? Do people still buy stocks as they go down or do you go cash

Like with any crash, there is fear thereafter.  Dot com happened and the accounting scandals begun.. Enron, world-com, tyco.. Wall Street darlings.  Amazon and other darling “new paradigm” companies were -95% and going bankrupt everyday.

You think Tesla is hot today? Have a look at Amazon from 99 to 01.. it later bottomed at $5.xx after having gone up $5 to $100 in under a year from 98-99.

https://i.imgur.com/QZcU2OI.jpg

Amazons historical chart is especially nice because the stock has never split. The prices you see are what they were back then.

—-

Once average Joe got accustomed to the reality that stocks are “dangerous” and “you can’t live in your worthless share certificates”... on came the next great investment to make that you that big money you saw just a few years ago... *real estate.*

So no.. not too many people were talking about stocks until 06-07 and that’s when the cracks in real estate were coming through.  We know the rest of the story.



On a side note.. Dot com started showing cracks when the fed raised the rates in quick succession spooking the market. It went higher but there was fear.  The accounting scandals, 9/11, war in Afghanistan, then Iraq, hurricane katrina etc all happened back to back to back. No exactly “safe” from an average Joe’s point of view.

Anyway..  people are *always* looking to make fast money. It happens again and again.. junk bonds in the late 80s  early 90s, “internet” stocks in 97-00, real estate and housing derivatives 05-08.  You can see the same patterns play out today in crypto markets, EV and SPAC’s.  No one asks questions on how this technology can actually be used to *make money*.  It’s completely secondary to “buy now and sell higher” ... you know ... *greater fools theory* in action.

How what’s the count on Biden saying clean energy so far?
I did miss out on GME. I was too afraid to go in when it was at 17$ and look at in now. I'm fairly new at this and am trying to get into the ship.
ARKQ + ICLN
HE SAID IT AGAIN!!!!
Clean energy!!!
CLEARN ENREGY
HE SAID IT
All politicians over the age of 65 or so are dried up stinky dick lickers.
......
He said clean energy ⚡️
HE SAID BATTERYYYYYYYY

ENERGYYYYY
AAPL 128 02/26
"if you work 40 hours a week and make less than $15/hr then you're living in poverty"

depends on where you live tbh. $12/hr probably isn't too bad in places like alabama or kentucky. Minimum wage should be set by state, which it already is, since states have didn't cause of living
He said it again clean energy everybody take a shot and buy calls.
Wow cathie you couldn’t have pumped pltr yesterday my calls expire tomorrow
CLEAN ENERGY FUCKERS
I’m gonna fucking cum.
I’m balls deep in XOM 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Biden said pltr. Your patience has paid off friend 😘
It will, but honestly good. If they can't afford to pay $15/hr they probably weren't meant to make it anyway.
OMG CLEAN ENERGY OMG OMG OMG ITS HAPPENING!!!!
He said clean energy again!
Thanks bro 👊🙂
CLEAN ENERGY
He said it! Clean energy!
It’s above $42 (at the time I’m writing this) already in AH.

Can we squeeze this after gme?
Here we go

HOLY SHIT BUYDEN PUMPING EVERYTHING
Hey thanks fam hopefully I gave ya some giggles
Nah they are doubling down on petroleum, which can be good for them if everyone else diversifies. If you want oil majors that are moving into green spaces look at Shell or Chevron.
I help
HE SAID IT AGAIN, CLIMATE CRISIS YES JOE! I KNEW I WATCHED THIS FOR A GOOD REASON
HE SAID CLIMATE CHANGE.
NEVER in my life did I think the word “infrastructure” would get me sooo hyped
YESS Joe!
Anyone have any good resource for understanding calls? I’m brand new today and don’t want to miss BB 🚀🚀🚀
He said clean energy!
CLEAN ENERGY HE SAID IT AGAIN
Yes welcome aboard comrade. Please do not fart in your space suit, we will reuse them for the next moon mission.
HE SAID IT!!!
Small gains add up for sure. Everyone wants to go to the moon but a lot of the ones they said would do that are still grounded! No one made it rich overnight, it takes time and lots of effort (and a little luck haha)

Plus cycling through a lot of stocks gives me a hobby and keeps me busy, so that’s nice.

I’ll upload a video of her first covered call. 😂

In my trading account, I’m currently selling OTM covered calls on AAPL, SWBI, RKT, APHA, MJ, DKNG, AMD, DAL, T.  And now PLTR I guess. 🤷‍♀️ Holding shares of ICLN, TAN, and a bunch of weed stonks. I hold etfs and total stock market indexes in hubby’s retirement accounts, and a mix of all of the above in mine.
Don’t you fucking dare apologize for this masterpiece.
Fuck yes. I love you joe Biden.
interest rates will have to go up by 2022
Hi! New to trading, have approx \~$500 USD to play with that I'm looking to securely grow with mostly safe long-term stocks, and some more risky short term ones (but still responsible!). Any help would be greatly appreciated while I'm still even :)

So far I am:

\- 10% NIO  
\- 10% BABA  
\- 10% PINS  
\- 10% AMD  
\- 20% ISRG  
\- 30% AAPL

Going to snap up some BTC and some TSLA when feel more confident and the price seems right :)

Everything in this post. 
This was an intelligent thought out gamble and everything worked out in his favor for an absolute massive payout due to his patience and procedural precision. Let’s see what king of payout he walks away with. Who knows what is to come, and when this diamond hand genius will sell.... 😎
Because he can pump and dump and profit off of people who don't understand pump and dumps.

To the guy saying Enphase is done and buy puts. Enphase makes micro-inverters. Tesla is releasing a central inverter. Companies like SMA and SolarEdge will be more affected by Tesla’s new inverter. Enphase will be fine.

Yesss he said clean energy and climate change!!!!
HE SAID THE THING
build our roads to make them faster lmfao
Shit man I’m sorry if it makes you feel any better I lost a tuck load from my TSM gains from today chasing TSLA.
The 14th isn't showing up for me. I just saw from 31/12 to 13/1
Lot of 2000$ check is gonna go to TSLA OTM calls. If same gamma squeeze happens like last time where all the call sellers are running to buy the stocks to hedge their positions. TSLA gonna have a 1000$ run when the first check comes out.
CLEAN ENERGY
That’s some big dick energy.
Clean energy. Let’s go to the moon
HE SAID IT HE SAID IT HE SAID CLEAN ENERGY AND INFRSTRUCTURE
**Battery, energy, clean energy, infrastructure** yeah, yeah, yeah 💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦
Current market cap is $1.3 billion actually. 

[Found some press](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/porch-group-announces-four-strategic-210500882.html) showing their projected 2021 revenue was just increased to $170 million, which would represent a 134% YoY growth rate. Doubling would put its P/S ratio just above 15. Without any published financial history, there's not a lot better to go on than that, but by itself, 15 seems reasonable considering the rate of expansion and announcing four acquisitions today. 

To back what you're saying, LazyFA shows total cash/equivalents, plus current assets, totaling approximately 1/5th of the balance on their total liabilities (though LazyFA shows zero debt, so not sure what a liability would be without any debt - I'll chalk this up to newly-public company, lack of available data, as macrotrends isn't showing anything either). 

I can see throwing 0.25% of my portfolio at it for FOMO sake and call it a gambling play, but I wouldn't do more than that without some published numbers and hard data to look at.
Options to buy with big gains in the next 2 weeks?
Marvin's got the wettest.  Some have even called them Sharts

Biden just said to pre order a new PS5 on my IPhone on GameStop.com while high on marijuana and to pick it up in my EV
No problem man, It's good to keep a note of what ARK is buying and selling. Some smart mofos there.
If consumer buying power moves up it's always a good thing. Anything negative in the markets is an overreaction.
He said ICLN!

One of the articles linked on RH proposes a $200 share price in 2022. I guess everything will need more memory? I'd be pretty pumped if that came true.

Biden just said clean energy boys!!! To tendie town we go🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I 100% agree with this, and to me this is a continuous process. But self reviews are a tiny fraction of an overall effort. What matters more is what else you're doing and brokering the other 360+ days a year.
>blackberry?

BBY is Best Buy, BB is blackberry. Please get your tendies bro
Biden speech is a classic sell the news
Intentionally making bad choices is gambling. Choices such as buying way OTM calls on the .001% chance you quadruple your return. 

It’s not gambling if you stick to stocks with stable track records. Making smart choices is investing. In fact, parking your money in a savings account and watching it lose value to inflation every year is a losing proposition. 

But the first time you make more money in a day than you do in a month in your regular job...it is a rush.
says the dude trying to become rich in the greediest subreddit
At this point should Biden put Cathie in his cabinet?
Wtf am I gonna do if our President isn't mentioning the current DOW price every time he talks?
Darn he just said battery and clean energy and i climaxed!!!
This shit is such a shit pump. Buydon more like Liedon
gonna have to at open
Thanks a lot mate will definitely take that on board. Currently on a reasonably low salary as I'm on my first job after uni but hoping this will change soon, regardless, I'd rather not get taxed any more than I need to so will stick to your advice. Cheers pal
Wait, you sold the 1/15 calls for only 1M?  Ban
Wtf do you think son?

BB, ICLN, PLTR
You are too bullish about your own future for such poor performance. 
Statistics are also against you. Just buy index funds and use your time to learn a marketable skill for a side hustle
I mean...I wouldn't trade having access to the city for being stuck in the middle of nowhere...so it's worth it for me.  I make enough that my 10 year plan is a house in the city and a second house somewhere with lower COL.  Taxes aren't that much higher and I'd have to be paid significantly more to put up with living in low cost of living areas. If it's low COL then there's generally a reason why.
Is Biden papa now?
IWM gonna get cleaned tomorrow
CLEAN ENERGY, COME ON GOEV

Money is fungible so right it doesn't matter exactly what the source of the income is, and you're right in that the Roth IRA income limit is based on MAGI, but that has nothing to do with my comment...

They cannot contribute to an IRA if they no earned income, they have to have at least 6k in earned income in order to contribute the full 6k - OP said they have no other source of income, and capital gains is not considered earned income, so no, they cannot contribute to an IRA
Just reward a little, fellow tard.
So what you’re saying is 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Asians not poor
I had GME for about 8 weeks, made a peak of 170%, but sold major chunks out at 10/20/50/100. So overall not a huge amount. Maximum per stock was 8%. Your gains are still epic
Did he just use a quadruple negative?
dear god someone help me i dont have enough money to invest in even 1 call of BB and if i sell my current shares i will have to wait until next week to get in which scares me. i didnt get into GME bc i dont ever have any extra cash. what do i do.
Bc politicians don't want to think beyond the broad strokes
Arkw has been buying pltr
$15 per hour is going to destroy small businesses lol

Buyden should wrap up every speech with some variation of his "then you ain't black" meme.
Pffft, wouldn’t YOU like to know 😎
Best way to start off is an S&P index (voo or something similar). Basically leave it in there and forget about it.

But I also like to mix in tech ETFs/Mutual Funds (VGT/T-Rowe Price)

My ROTH IRA is: 30k (50% voo 50% vgt)
My 401k is 40k (40% VFIAX and 60 % VGT)
Wow that’s like $5000.00 a person. Have fun paying that all back Americans. My condolences.

How many double negatives was that
I think that while some theaters like AMC are still a risky play, theaters in general are never disappearing. Yes, new releases can be watched from home, but that’s not the real reason people go. It’s for the experience. Just like my wife and all her friends, there are still multitudes that want to go. The smell of popcorn, the commercials for checking on what good movies are coming out, and the place itself acting as a social medium for friends and dates all factor into the unique atmosphere it creates (all according to her). It’s been such a standard for dates and hanging out for the past 100 years that ripping it out of American culture seems highly unlikely. Maybe a really long term play, but the industry will recover for sure
That’s why he put 2k on BB🚀🚀🚀🚀
He’s so fake it hurts
Invest? INVEST!!!
Cathie bought 500k shares today
I generally recommend that people practice with paper trading before trying real money trading, so your mistakes won't cost you money.

You can find the answers to basic questions like this in the resource links at the top of this page. **Getting started in options** is a good place to start.

A limit price is an essential part of a limit order. The order will be filled only for the limit price *or better*. Since you are buying, that means $0.15 or lower. Always use a limit order and actively set the limit. Submit the order (when the market is open -- the market is closed is why yours got queued and got that message) and wait 10 seconds. If it is filled, done. If it is not filled, modify the order (cancel, resubmit) to be slightly closer to the market. What's the market? For buyers, it's the ask price. For sellers, it's the bid price.

Yes, for a day order, which is the default, if it is not filled it will be automatically canceled. But don't wait a whole day for an order to fill. Ten seconds is plenty.
Biden literally told America to buy the dip
NEVER DOUBT YOUR VIBE. PLTR🚀

"GME will be full on e-commerce supplying any type of electronics imaginable, probably will..."  


Yeah ok, you're from the future and you're talking about the past in your timeline. Got it.  


Yeah you do have a point, it was kind of negative. I apologize for that. I just didn't see how GME would supply any type of electronics imaginable. They won't be competing with digikey and mouser, or parts express. But I have bought electronics from them recently.  


I don't even understand what "amazon of electronics" means except for hyping a meme. How are they going to compete with amazon?

Can you imagine if Biden just brought up a line of his favorite CEOs just for them to kiss his ass and pump stocks? Last year was a wild time.
:(
Check with a broker - call Fidelity or your bank if they offer a ROTH. I'm pretty sure you can contribute your gains to a ROTH. The ROTH limits are caps not minimums.  

But I suggest using a broker instead if you want to trade stocks in the account.
PLTR tomorrow $60 EOD!  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀
Yeah, i dont like IVs in the weeklies. But you do you. It's gonna moon anyways.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
SAY IT. SAY ELECTRIC VEHICLES
Look at OSTK last year from the end of June to August.
Hypothetically what would happen if every single person that owned GME stock put in a sell order with a limit price of like $200?

As brokers force people to close short positions, they would be forced to buy at $200 right?
Say something about clean coal
So, im debating buying more. I had a bit in there, i sold some a couple weeks ago. I didnt expect this to happen lol so I took some profit. We really think its gonna keep going? If so, im gonna put more back in.

I don’t know exactly what you guys want to hear from Buyden, but I hope he says exactly what it takes to send your portfolios over the moon tomorrow. Good luck out there, retards.
OOF he’s to the tax part
So this may be a dumb question but who is holding before the spike in RH users?  The company?  People on other platforms?  Market makers?  Someone is selling all the way to the top to these users and it has to come from somewhere.

I have never tried trading before at all, watched the WSB page for awhile and put $500 on RH a month ago, currently at 925. I think knowing to take profits even if you missed the top is the only reason I keep going up.
If you are in this for the long term and want to trade as a business they are incredible. I was with them for 6 months and learned a lot! Remember it’s tailored to safe trading over a long career. No low float penny stocks. 

I would start with the chat room only. They bring different folks on the mic all day and you can learn so much in if you have the time.
Buy them while you can🚀🚀
I'm not sure what you mean by "a mini Tesla of the hydrogen world". A sleeper value buy? An over-valued meme stock? This phrase is rooted in your opinion of Tesla which I can't determine one way or the other.

I would not invest in a company without understanding the fundamentals of their service. Tesla makes sense because batteries+car manufacturing a both well established industries that happen to work well together right now.

Hydrogen is a different industry all-together. From my technical perspective hydrogen has no future. You can find dissenting opinions though.

 It is less energy efficient than pure electric and has the same overhead limitations that traditional petrol has. It also will never be truly renewable like electric power. It relies on other actual renewable technologies in order to *seem* renewable. The hype will die.

Will they corner the hydrogen market? I don't think so. It's possible with enough investment though. Old hydrogen production methods are vastly more cost effective albeit polluting. They won't be going away anytime soon.
INVEST NOW!!!
PLTR Cathie approved
STOP THE COUNT BIDEN
He doesn’t even know what he is saying
NAH VALE, MT, CLF
Yeah I don’t know but my take is if they offer shares but it’s nowhere enough for covering it doesn’t change the short squeeze thesis and provides GME with extra cash so it strengthens their position.
#FUCK
Man I need to learn how to buy shorts. Anyone have recommendations on where to learn?
Facebook
This is the way
Confirmed?
What happens to PLTR?
wait biden why are u crash mkt
So mine isn’t settled yet, so I’m not sure if I can use margin even tbh. I’ll have to check tomorrow after I close positions. It’s probbaly have to be settled tho tbh
Them buying 500k is the equivalent to you buying 2 shares
When he stuttered he said BABA , baba to the moon 🚀🟢🟢🟩🟩
BUYDEN NO
Thank God my pltr calls might actually print now. Gme was my only green stock all day.
These 2K checks is going straight to Timmy Iphone12

AAPL to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
My guess is that a lot of people are having the same thoughts as you - taking GME profits and dumping them into BB. You could lead the charge. Sell half your GME and toss it in to BB.
Bring back Trump, this grandpa fucking sucks
Futures why you red
is it too late to get in?
Just said, Clean Battery Tech, AI, Solar, and future energy all in the same sentence.
calls never expire on monday.
I sold $32 for next week. I’m worried.
I can confirm I shorted at 42.70 and covered at 41.30 to keep bulls from getting paid on their $40 calls
Almost up to 2 million shares.
American manufacturing huh? Yeah tsm is too big to fall now, don’t touch my tendies.
A LEGEND providing YERS OF EXCELLENT HELP TO THE FUTURW GENERATIONS OF THE FUTURE ALPHAS 💎🙌 MAY GOD BLESS THIS TRADE 🙏

THE TAXES ARE COMING THE TAXES ARE COMING!
Please mention canopy growth and black berry
Can someone tell me what this means
You assholes have me convince! 

In for 502 shares cause I'm too retarded to option. Please take me with you
Biden...say cleeeaaaan....


ENERGY!!!!
With he $15 federal minimum wage increase it'll get people who are holding onto unemployment back to work sooner. This is smart.
Yes but that’s also illegal
Uh oh. That commie talk just took us down
Very little talking was involved.
This guy gets it
So should we sell tomorrow since he closed one of his calls?
Been that way for a decade
I don’t know. I’ve been a user for a while so that may be it.
Plz
FUTURES ARE NOT IMPRESSED.
Dude if this shit goes to 100 I’m in for a GME ass cheek tattoo as well

$1k into GME?
Me calculating what I'm going tell my girlfriends I *would* have made if I just bought Jan 15 GME Calls and not touched them when I told myself I should.
I dont understand how to squeeze , can someone tell me when this short squeeze is suppose to happen? 

I get it, tutes have to cover so they buy in, but when does that happen..
Poke ICLN with your stick Joe. Say it with me, read that prompter. “GREEN ENERGY”
Biden is horny as fuck for a good economic recovery 😂
Half this sub works at Wendy’s, now they get $15 an hour. Market is about to break the stratosphere. 🚀
Long = long schlong

Short = 😆🤏🍆
WSB is the world's most elite hedge fund
Hahahahaha.... Sigh... I wish this wasn't painfully accurate :/
Yes, this is an interesting one. Despite having around 20% market share in China, it will still the largest market for Boeing in few years. They can’t disrupt COMAC supply chain, as it will hurt Boeing as China can respond by simply banning Boeing and going Airbus. ARJ21 was just ok enough but C919 could be an issue.
Earnings might be low, buy gradually
Damn I got 15c 1/15 ??????

Hey don’t hate the player. I’m just playing the market literally anyone can do what I did.
There he goes talking about taxing the rich lmfao.. market aint gonna like tht boss.
Finally some news on PLTR! Zaddy Karp and Mama Wood = 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Wait till after the lock up Has expired and all of the insiders have dumped all their shares that’s when we go on a mad buying spree and create the next GME moon mission
Just stop. He’s not going to dump his 6 months of income into otm TSLA calls no matter how hard you yikes at him.
" everyone will pay their fair share " - Futures be like fuuuuck that
Lol, I sold those 55 calls that expire tomorrow. And, if they print for you, I’ll be cheering with you because it was a covered call sale. So, if it prints, it means my shares will have jumped from $19 a few days ago to over $55 by EOD tomorrow, and I’m good with that!!

So, here’s to those 55s printing for you tomorrow!!
We'll become like the vikings and raid Canada
biden wrecking my spy calls
Spy not like closing tax loopholes
I've dreamed (perhaps naively) about becoming an MTA conductor and riding the subways all day in my own private room, alone, reflecting endlessly on life and the meaning of it all.
DO IT, DO IT NOW ES! :D
Amazon pack your shit, they coming for your bald ass. Split you shares or they going to split your ass
Fuck! We were up bigly before the speech. Now we're BLEEDING! Bring back 🥭
Good timing. Cathie just added almost 500k in shares today to arkw.
Ford gang 🛻🛻🛻
BABA BOOEY
Went over battery tech and clean energy
And more games at GME
Man - if I wrote this speech it would start with “be ya’ll seen the movie Crank? America’s economy is Jason Statham.”
Why is everything dumping on stimmy news?
Got a COVID test yesterday to fly tomorrow. Been refreshing that shit like a college application and still “in progress.” Ugh
This guy fracks
Don't be grateful, be marginally less condemnimg of their abusive corporate behavior that makes money off hate propaganda. This sounds like someone in an abusive relationship
Sheesh not bad
Biden just needs to say “your calls will print” and drop the mic
I’d feel safer with BB at this point.

But what do I know? I’m just as retarded as every other person here.
I only started in August and I'm up 36% but I'm mostly just lucky that I bought some TSLA. Just focus on something like SPY and let time do the work, pick something odd and fun when you have the chance imo.
What’s expiry date did you pick?
This guy sucks
It always goes back up after hours
Holy shit SENS  putting me to ATH 🚀🚀🚀
ARKG and THCB gonna moon tomorrow
Looks like puts are back on the menu tomorrow
Wood
Tanked?
We can’t afford do not do this stuff?
At 90 it’s market cap is equal to their yearly revenue
Nice. A lot of jobs are in small businesses, and now they’re fucked. Lmaooooooo
No stop talking stop
Biden said 2000% of stimulus funds going to gamers. Hold forever
Bruh just *say our tickers* 🙏
what do the BBB hat look like
Omg! Tards! PLTR AH! 🚀
how many shares did they own before this? Shows 1.9M at the moment
You, like 99% of us here, are retards 

You become an autist after you post your 1000+% gain porn
Ark bought more PLTR today!!! After hours $26.50, just in time for tomorrow’s $25 unpin. Let’s gooooooooooooo
Yeah this is a shit show, none of this helps the market.
Biden is not my president!

Actually I’m from Germany.
Can Cathie buy up a bunch of GME? That would be dope
EOSE ~13% today. I was eyeing it but dont know a whole lot about it. Seems like some news broke that is driving away investors. Not sure I want to be in it.
In Cathie we trust
Mostly for the shit posting and confirmation bias when y'll aren't screaming about meme stocks.
Fr tho. FA x Stonks
Fuck so my KFC tendies are gonna become more expensive?
Why is pltr going up? I’m not paying attention.

Tax the rich = the rich don’t pull out of stonks
They are one of the "clean supermajors" along with Enel, Iberdrola, and Orsted. I think ALE looks more promising and pays a good dividend.
We’re taking the world with us bro.

Welcome to thunder dome
Futures down as soon as he mentioned taxes
MOASS
🤡
Fuck why we drilling ? He wants to tax us into the Stone age ?
BIDEN OWNS ALL ARK FUNDS
He said "raise taxes", ban Biden!
It wasn't not very too many I don't think unless he didn't mean it the way he said it ya know?
Cathie just bought PLTR for one of her ARK funds.
U don’t get scared of it tanking one day and losing everything? I’m such a pessimist and that shit killlls me when wanting to make financial decisions.... always thinking the worst... and “playing it safe”..
Tf they selling hard. Was this a sell the news event?
Cuz Cathie is a smartie
futures are not liking what biden is saying
Ever heard of Fordism?
Say clean energy one more time
Dude said innovation, biotech, clean energy, robotics, manufacturing, batteries

Nah I work for my gf’s family
Premium - $.10 (fee you pay, each contract is for the rights to buy 100 shares at the strike price so $.10 x 100 means this call will cost you $10.00)

Stock price - $8 (what the price of the stock currently is when you)

Strike price - $6 (where you think the price will go)

Stock price - (Strike price + premium) = $1.9

$1.9 x 100 = $190.  So this makes you $190, if the price didn't exceed the break even point (strike price + premium = break even point, $6 + $.1 = $6.10 in this instance) by the time the option expires your option is worthless and you're out the $10 premium.  I think that's it, maybe I'm retarded.
$2000c 1/15
Now do PLTR 🚀🚀🚀
There goes the market
EOD I YOLO'd 2.5k on ODE for a bunch of clean energy stonks that dipped today:

1/15/21 calls (~300-500 on each):

RUN 85C

JKS 60C

IDEX 3C

GOEV 15C

ICLN 32C

RMO 20C

PBW 125C

We'll see how tomorrow goes.
Buy and hold. There is literally no ceiling on this, MM owes more than they can buy. THERE IS NO CEILING 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Asking myself the same thing
Can someone explain to me how his april calls are worth what is even less than just the intrinsic value?
I'm not sure what IVs in the weeklies means,
 (Interested to know genuinely as im still learning terminology
Spy ran for the exit real quick
Will it save my Visa calls??
Sort of. Stripe is more about accepting payments yourself, usually via a credit card (although their product suite has grown). I have a "what does stripe do" piece coming soon :)
cathie gives me wood
Pear share
“taxes”


**GUH**
It may actually be more towards the earlier stages still given that short positions were *increased* today by the institutional short sellers trying to combat the price increase. At least from the data I was seeing during the day.
GREENBEAN📈📈📈📈
Is this a... president?
Love you bb
American economics = spectator sport is actually so true
The pajama traders are not impressed
How is Biden crashing this!! Wtf
hopefully some of that happens tmrw for my 2x 1/15 900c's lol
Jfc, cathie 🪵 has been buying PLTR?! FUCK YES
Can someone explain the catalyst for this moon mission?
Oh for sure.  But there's also the problem that people who legit rely on food pantries have to deal with whatever crap gets donated, which is often cheap and shitty.  It's a god damn mess out there.  People need to be responsible for what they shove into their faces, and healthier food needs to be more attainable to make it more attractive.
I make my own hrs
no it doesn't work like that. They'll use stocks bought by margin accounts by borrowing the stocks
You need a marketing guy to help you make this a dream.  You can get .1% of every transaction filled through this method.  

Just need to tell them use yours so it doesn't bloat their app with something a good amount of people won't use so they don't go building it in
I have a patriotic boner I haven't felt in 4 years 
Tomorrow will be fucking green
Sweet 👸
Just tried to post this.. they never get past the mods.. I get them on Twitter usually before the email from ARK https://twitter.com/arkkdaily/status/1349877784177496066?s=21
Lmao of course. This speech somehow hurts slv

I’d be fine with markets crashing but just pltr and gme green af 🤷‍♂️
Like you mentioned about lucky timing, I went 15% in TNA and 15% in KORU (both 3x leveraged ETFs) at start of year and said I was holding line at least a month on both no matter what, and the both went ham and have done 25% in 2 weeks. Good timing helps for sure!
BB to 13 tomorrow? 14? 69?
Cathie’s also buying NNDM shares on a daily basis for weeks. Get in before we take off.
I have been making quite a bit on selling Puts on AMC to 🌈🐻s
SPY does not like this

why futures dieing
So.... when we go for actually trying to fix somethings in America... market no likey?
Don’t worry goev has some announcements this month still .  My trinity holds are GME PLTR GOEV
Seriously pondering if i should YOLO my 10k account into GME tomorrow

Biden dropped so many buzz words like biotech, clean energy, and AI 🌕
[young investors doubled their money in 2020](https://imgur.com/VnVdQRU)

Yo this chick ain’t bad, she’s my age and she’s in PLUG? Hit my dms if you here I got GME calls we can rule the world together
So do people suggesting buying with an expiration a week out? A month? How is this played on our part?
What's the fuss about PLTR suddenly? What happened?
He didn’t even say anything bad, what the fuck
Paragraphs man
Futures go weeeeee!!!!
There’s only one house. 

And the 50/50 split in the senate has questionable roots. Lots of moderates on both sides of the aisle. 

Not trying to argue with you here. Just keeping a level perspective until reality plays out. 

It might turn out to be a helluva fight for Biden Admin to get much passed in the next 12 months
GME, PLTR and APHA after hours make it seem like covid got cured already. Is that not accurate?
HE SAID CLEAN ENERGY AGAIN
It isn't only about money its about treating the people who work for you decently. NOONE can survive off 10$ an hr. We subsidized those wages, it's literally socialism for companies that refuse to pay a living wage. Maybe those business owners should make a sacrifice and not only worship money.
Yes
Lol that’s exactly my fees bro. Makes me want to cash out 20% and go full retard. Instead Last 3 days while I’ve been on “break” I’m about flat lol.
You posted about it lol
God dammit. Stop talking like that. Its annoying as fuck
Papa Joe and Aunt Cathie are going to make us rich
Maybe. It depends what the Chewy crew can come up with and execute. The potential is there in a growing $200 billion per year industry. The parallels to Blockbuster are apt, but we may see what Blockbuster COULD have been as Cohen is the type of leader that Blockbuster needed toward the end.
24% of every single Us Dollar created ever was printed in the last year. 

The slow deterioration of USD value has been happening since 1971 when Nixon got rid of the gold standard. 

But we’re at an exponential rate of devaluation and deterioration. 

But fuck it, stonks only go up!
did joe biden say anything about palantir?

Ok I know I have to buy OOTM PLTR calls with my stimmy check, but what date and strike price?
OMG his eye blinks in morse code just spelled out ICLN
Gonna miss mango pumps. Biden is such a stable person fuck
I’m going to Rio next month and this is my fear. Well...that an the fact that I’m going with my wife.
all on GME

I just added a small BB position to go along with my GME though with some freed up funds today, so you should probably just keep going 50/50
I live in the future
"Rich people and monopolistic companies have to actually pay their tax" SPY crashes through the ground 😂
I hope he says clean energy and batteries again lol
She already had PLTR. She just bought more today
Difference is GME is undervalued right now with new revenue number plus Cohen and other chewy guys on the board.

VW was overvalued BC Porsche was buying up stocks.
Biden man at least say we can all enjoy 🍉
See you on the 🌝
Real talk, I'm new to all this. I will have 2k to throw at stocks tomorrow. BB or GME? Any other suggestions? Looking for short term gains
he already said the words "clean energy"
nice downward trend...
Nah
I’m fucked
Correction by March eh 
You don’t think small

It’s $1400 ($2000 if you include the bill from December) per person, the rest is going to research and paying for vaccines I believe

The death of small businesses and complete reliance on the government is super bullish for the top 500 corporations
lol..Cramer called out WSB again today regarding WSB squeeze. I am sure he spends a significant part of his day visiting WSB.
I like your thinking, been long since $90, and hold $CGC $APHA since 2015.
wait till kamala speaks
Why is it crashin??
My 23C for tomorrow needs it tho
Hahaha
I feel like we gotta look at GDP by state and then factor in population but im on WSB so I don't believe in economics.
I'll do it for my own benefit but if theres a chance to use it, I would post my findings in whatever post I come across.
This is going past $50 within 3 months. This is going faster than anticipated 🚀

Oh shit sell the news FUCK

Futures don’t mean shit shut the fuck up

Jeez, this is fun to talk about in WSB terms but holy fuck... This country is in trouble when we are throwing around $2 trillion like it's $2 billion. Our dollar will be worth shit the very second someone has a bigger gun than us.
Value stocks perform better in high inflation periods and growth stocks perform better during low inflation. When inflation is on the upswing, income-oriented or high-dividend-paying stock prices generally decline. Stocks overall do seem to be more volatile during highly inflationary periods.
Yo where is the I CLN 5% jump at
Will it be too late to buy PLTR at open tomorrow?
Why is everyone celebrating?  Futures are dumping hard
Uhhhhh wtf spy
Why Biden fucking us
sounds like a bad business model if you can't pay your employees a living wage...
username checks out
Sorry I’m late. Did he say ICLN yet?
eat the rich! eat the rich!
Why is tsla not mooning? What the fuck?
You want a 💎🍆 go talk to u/DeepFuckingValue. So yeah, your wife's boyfriend.
It’s very rare that the sale price of the options would be less than exercising and selling the stock. That would be the only time exercising would make more sense than selling the contracts. You just sell the option contracts to close it out and take the profit. In this case the option contracts should be trading at $10 or higher (likely higher since even on expiration day there is a small amount of IV).
Did biydun turn into a lizard or something?
GME better save me
when does this come out on itunes
She wouldn’t do that to us

ARKW has been in it. Today’s buy brought it up to nearly 2 million shares.

Bro, Biden hasn't said bigly once this entire speech, what the fuck
Pajamas in pain

***US President-elect Biden says there is real pain overwhelming in the real economy, adds there is no time to waste and we have to act now***
Let’s gooooooo!!!
the fuck you staring at his lips for
So what do you think or recommend? I am seeing a lot of talk about BB but I don't know if I should get shares or calls. As I said I am new at this and super retarded. Really looking to change my life if possible.
Biden just said $15 minimum wage. Who’s going to make the kiosk that will be replacing the high school kids at McDonald’s and the grocery store?  If they’re publicly traded, calls will print.
DAMN SON, WHERE’D YOU FIND THIS?!
C mom old man, show us your 2003 blackberry so it can go to $20
BB time or not this time? 

again and again, I know, but this time, I think I may feel a real disruption in the force, and you?
ARKW bought 497,100 shares today. got the email 17mins ago
Yeh i know man, sitting here watching everything go up while im at a huge loss on rlftf and cant justify selling till it goes back up
Good year ahead of us green gang !
If I had to guess I'd say we're a quarter or a third of the way there
Ask any place in the US that already tried it. Don’t work
Good move not covering up that herpes blister on Joes part. Shows he’s a man of the people.
I'm unfamiliar.  I just jumped in for the YOLO.  What's up with the FB settlement.
Alright fellas. Brass tax. How high does GME go tomorrow. I don’t wanna hear no bullshit.
Financial crisis lots of people became gold bugs and got wrecked
“I will always be honest with you.”

LOL yeah ok, no politician has broken that.

Wait till Alzheimer’s hits in a few months
Do I sell gme, take profit, and put it into clean energy or we holding this shit??
Every time Biden or Cuomo spoke last yr we tanked and everyone is acting surprised lmao
Those fucks are being manipulated and you know it lol
I mean, statistically this is always the better option. Picking stocks is fun but nobody reliably beats the market, not even pros.
RAP. GOD.

PLTR to the mutherfuckin’ moon. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

MC Karp Daddy in the hizouse.

So glad I bought puts. This is priced in retards.
Is this the bottom?!?!?
BB will outperform GME tomorrow
Looked like GME to me.
Can't find the link??? But loving the futures
Lmao, I have TLRY, GME, and BB shares. I was losing on BB til today.
"closing tax loopholes"
Whoa she made 150 pieces that's uh, good right?
I think they've figured out that he's retarded
Y’all bitches. Futes down .1%
Regulation=higher costs=lower production=BULLISH AF FOR OIL

Kathee Woods ILY <3333
omg so refreshing to have a presidential speech sound like an actual presidential speech. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
This stock is going to $100 by summer so strap in big boy
$100 by when?
I've stopped learning things at jobs well before 8 years.
PLTR $48 waiting room 🚀🚀🚀
He said it already
The word Bigly doesn't even come close to what we're about to experience with GME tomorrow. Stratospheric, interstellic, celestial, are all within reach in comparison...GME is going further. BEYOND our galaxy. Unlike anything the modern market has every witnessed. The power that GME has buried deep in its loins surpasses even that of the sun itself. The greatest transfer of wealth is upon us.

&#x200B;

GME $60, no $70 eod.
“Rich” = any household that makes over $100k 😂😖
Wallstreetpets.com
He directly mentioned it
Lol I liquidated my boomer account to buy GME shares
I’m in for premarket 🚀🚀
He said clean energy twice, so basically
Someone shut Dementia up, he’s tanking it
YOUR NEXT STOCK... EXPR had highest volume is HISTORY today and broke a 3 year trend 

You want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money
You should probably try and max out your retirement options/accounts and boomer them. I’ve had a separate fun money account that I’ve put something into every month since I was 18 to do whatever. Of course my tax obligation is full there. However one of the things I regret the most is also boomering that account t and being afraid of taking profits because of the tax obligation. Now that I’m 40 it could have been a lot bigger if I wasn’t long on everything in there forever. 

This is not financial advice.
Got into FB at 260 and I had seen it hold that level (200 day average) a couple of times to bounce back to mid 270's.

I got in  this time so it had to go down. Added some more today at 246. Slowly nibbling and doing DCA....near term believe it will go lower.  Low 200's will be a steal.

Big tech hasn't moved much ..a correction and everything will get hit some more whether they rallied or not.

No get half your position at open and wait 30 minutes to see if sells off a bit and then go all in.
Lol, this is why I'm not selling. Unlike other short squeeze there's plenty of shares with low borrowing fees to kill a rally. GME? It's on Hard-To-Borrow for months on end with insanely high fees with very low liquidity/insane bid-ask prices, super low float.

Also Melvin looking to wind 72m shares of 69.5m outstanding lol. People looking to short for pennies in front of Melvin stampeding out the door as soon as the door creaks open.

Agreed. But the only lesson OP still hasn’t learned is to tame is arrogance and confidence. He still believes that he’s going to be the one in that small percentage that actually becomes a millionaire doing this. 

It takes a lot of effort to not have made money during thhe last 8 months. Even if you put a cat to pick random stocks you would have performed better than op.

He would be better off putting money on index funds.
How do you find the key levels. Like you talked about 37 was a key level for gme
If you are new then shares no question.
couple months ago? take a look at SLV. it was being hyped like crazy at the time, tons of DD posts, good theory. I threw a small position at it, exited quickly, then watched it get manipulated back down really easily.

1.9M should be how much they own before today, I think it takes them a few days to update that list
I see.  Interesting.

1. I hope you didn’t sell between now and when you wrote the message, because it’s up to 1.85.  Cheers!

2. My advice is to take 1/2 now and immediately plan the price levels that you’ll take the rest at.  If I were you, I’d keep cutting it in half every time it gains 50 cents.  So, half now, half of the remainder at $2.5, half of that at $3.00... etc 

3. As a profitable day trader, I can’t suggest strongly enough that you only enter into a trade when you have a clear strategy that details what you’ll do in every possible outcome. If you want to trade actively and aggressively, that will be necessary for success.

4. Check out the SPACs attack show on YouTub by Benzinga.  It’s live every weekday at 8 AM and all of the past episodes are recorded. That’s a great way to stay up-to-date on news and they also give basic Strategic advice.

Congrats on your early success

Holding AMC $4c Jan 2022 right now as a gamble play. When these guys first announced they had enough money to survive they shot back up from where they are now, so if they manage to survive or there are buyout rumors then these should print.

These are two unrelated things. Small businesses aren’t failing because they are paying their employees too much. They are getting squashed by larger companies who also have legislation behind them. You can help small business through other means. Paying livable wages will solve more problems than it creates.

They don’t need to compete with Amazon, a company valued at like 600x what GME is valued at, that is obviously an over exaggeration, but Amazon is sketchy for buying electronics, it’s a big opportunity, especially if GME shifts more into selling high quality PC’s and monitors which are typically not bought from stores with brand recognition, that could be a huge market for them.   Given their tiny market cap all they have to do is be decently profitable and grow their e-commerce sales and the stock will continue to rise

No point. You can calculate the payoff value off the option as there is no theta to price in. Buy Jan 22

This is literally a yolo. My P&L for my trading portfolio today is around $2400, so I just told her to pick a red stock, and PLTR is one of the only red ones in my portfolio right now. It’s why she yells at the end, I bought a red stock!  😂 Sorry to disappoint, please don’t follow my two year old for trading advice lol

Coherent sentences holy shit
The bears really only come out at night 😂😂 .1 down and dudes celebrating. Get your cheeks ready for open
Well i bought that because I thought it was gunning for 38 and the volume came in there.  Then when it broke 38 it gave a nice smooth move to 43 area where I prolly should of took more profits.
Waited for the dilution that happened yesterday and loaded up on $10C 2/19 today. They should go in the money and I’ll exercise if they do and hold long term. Also buying more shares tomorrow if it’s down.
Yep
Don't forget capital gains

Cathie bought it for ARK.
I am really interested in watching anything e-commerce related over the next three years. Companies like Shopify, DocuSign and Chewy have all thrived during this down time for most businesses.

I guarantee some new accounts will appear, use some gamer words and the sub will get banned for 'hate speech'. What is going on here will not be allowed much longer.
Nah he literally mentioned them lol
Why didn't Cathie wait til Feb to buy PLTR at 20 instead?
My personal opinion is that this is such a complicated issue, and if Tencent is forced to divest then that's kinda "nationalizing" US (gaming) companies, and because of the complexity, risk to US companies, and optics, the status quo will remain
BACK TO BACK GREEN FRIDAYS??
I need MORE

Who has more shares of PLTR

WSB  or Cathy ?
I wish $40-$50. More realistically: $25 :-(

Yea one of the tickers on that list is a ‘banned wsb ticker’ whatever that means so I cropped it out.
MagiKarp money shots!
Taxes to build up our country’s infrastructure
Far as I understood with calls and merger acquisitions, your options expire as they are - so if they are out the money, they expire worthless and if they are in the money, you get compensated by the ITM value.


Unfortunately for most of WSB including myself, our calls were likely OTM, so I believe the market just terminates them. 


One day after my DD, this happens. I shared my position and included that I was burned for the January calls, and now February due to the acquisition happening at a lightning's notice, though it was expected to be well past inauguration and waiting on Australia's decisions.

Either way, lost $1000 on this and will look to my next play. Up big on Blackberry and Steel, should be other things to look out for in the near future.
Yep. The whole market.
Those 2 sectors plus cannabis have alot of growth.  Arkg and crispr is is the biggest advancement since antibiotics were discovered!

16K is well in the ballpark of solid gains friend! Obviously right now GME is kinda inflating gains on the sub. But not bad at all! 👏

I’m comfy

THE YEAR OF THE DRILL IS UPON US
UESSIR
THE WILL MUST BE DEMONSTRATED
Nice work. I bought the drop today.  Is this shit on Apple Music or Spotify yet?
sorry for the random thread bump..but can you explain why OP is stuck? I get that OP is only receiving a tiny amount of credit every time they roll, but isn't the point that the underlying is rapidly appreciating behind all this rolling?

So they still get to ride the underlying going up while still collecting a tiny credit as a bonus, is this correct?
I'll be honest. I never actually believed this speech would pump the market.

I just told people it would so they would FOMO into TICKERS that may help my positions 🐍🐍🐍
A lot of options expired today. I can imagine a spike tomorrow, demo day & earnings. Lockup should be negligible unless retail panics. Godspeed
You’re pathetic
TLRY APHA BB MOONING WTF
Why ARKs?

Agreed.

The whole thread seemed off.

It definitely ‘pumped’

Hell, Kramer is basically a WSB retread at this point. Not surprised others are trying to influence markets through Reddit threads.
On the stock app thing
Hello yes dis is FBI
🚀—-> 🪐
Take that to the bank $$$
kathy
Lol. Were you here during the first weeks of the pandemic? Every Trump speech was exciting. Not only would he rais SPY by 20 points for about an hour every time, but then he'd have some off-the-rails conversations.

I will miss having a prez that will answer any question even if he has no idea wtf he's talking about
What was it?
ARKW	01/14/2021	Buy	PLTR	69608A108	PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES 497,100
YOUR NEXT STOCK... EXPR had highest volume is HISTORY today and broke a 3 year trend 

You want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money
Here
Hands down funniest quote of the year:

&#x200B;

>"We will be responsible with taxpayer money" - Biden said tonight
Why does he whisper like that
They will because consumer buying power will be hire so they can charge more. Duh.
BB! BB! BB!
I am with you
He could still buy more shares with all that cash. Maybe he will if the stock ever dips significantly?
honestly, as minimum wage has been increasing in my province, 90% of micdicks and walmart have become self serve
this....  THIS!!!  FUCK AM I AMPED NOW!  LETS BURN CITI TO THE GROUND!  ARGGGHHHHHH!
No, been a long time associate and have been saying this for years
I just find Mark Cuban annoying in general. He knows just enough about everything to form a shitty argument.
LMND... Citron back at it again with a BS claim!
This guy can use $100 as toilet paper
Joe “GUH” Biden
fair point
Its not, and the bear cases I read tend to mistake the companies identity and understate its potential. I research many meme stocks that get mentioned here but genuinely believe SQ is different. Its my biggest holding for a reason.
Cmon Joey I have 8k in 1dte SPY calls, pump this shit!
But people arent supposed to work minimum wage. Its for entry level jobs and stuents but some people just dont want to advance with their career or make themselves unable to. This will cause inflation and make it worse for everyone. In the long run, the 15/hr will be redundant once the price of everything goes up.
I long for forgetting about what the president is doing every day.
Maybe try this dip
I think this is why it’s up 5% AH
$GME - media attention phase of your average bubble. Still tons of room to run.
"Quick let's sell and accelerate a taxable event!"
I didn’t and I am so fuck u
Biden needs to say his new limo is made by Tesla
Yes
Let’s get these gains
im so retarded   robinhood literally gave me a free share of a bed bath and beyond at 3.90 and now its at 28.54 . Should of listened to robinhood and gone in for the yolo
Can someone explain what happened here? I'm really new to investing and am really confused to what he did here. Did he basically pay $785k of shares and due to GME blowing up, his return was over $7 million?
ARKQ and ARKW hold a combined $110 million in shares. ARQX will also hold NNDM. This stock could very likely mirror what DDD is doing. Every offering the stock bounces back and then adds some momentum.
Either y’all’s charts are lagging or mine are.  I’m seeing spy futures at 3794 on a bounce
Bloomberg’s 2020 stock picker of the year going hard in the fucking paint on PLTR, ~500,000 shares
If the Palantir calls I bought for $2 and $3 as a joke actually pan out I’ll let my wife’s boyfriend play on the Nintendo switch tonight 🙌
What is?
Is that a bad thing?
ENKS  My mom is on the line
HYSR  sold my cat for this one
BUS Yolo
That’s why your wife has a bf. you don’t know what hard means
GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS
Poetry! Congrats man!
That can always be changed by congress
i got two of those
BB probably
What's your reasoning?
Im long AF on many things. I just hedged because it was obvious we go down tomorrow.
I'm gonna lose a lot of money tomorrow
Biden to announce separate stimulus dedicated entirely to purchasing printers
I did for this week but, I am reluctant to sell any for next week.
I bought mine to close mid day and that after hours move feels absolutely great now that I'm safe.
Not sure if $30 is OTM enough at this point for next week.
I think we might have finally made a decent break from the wedge.
She saved my ass on SPCE 🚀🚀
Lets get PLTR parabolic numb nuts 🚀🚀🚀🌚
Read and decide of you are long term or short term investor.
Or watch the video. I except more videos to come out soon.
But im sire it will pas the 2$ mark tomorrow. Next week is gonna run as well.
What article retard?
Gonna switch to shares and I’ll hold I guess
I was told red days were illegal
Cathie
Queen Cathie bought tons of shares. Thank god too, saved my 1/15 calls
Dude fuck yeah, new lawyer here, 160k debt, just started trading, working up the bankroll to one day make a yolo to freedom

Well fuck
Are you that investor that sold on the bad earnings?
I sold my BB call like a retard right before close
Gtfo futures don't matter
ARKK or ARKG???
“Together...together”
Earnings next week. The sold billions in just AirPods
I remember the good ole days where futures were up or down at least 1% in either direction
:( plz meme with me
Anyone think they’ll actually pass a $15 an hour minimum wage?
I need SPY to open at like $400
Fucking joe just tryin to fuk all our calls
Yes
It’s a REAL good news not just some worthless contract
Thanks man
Why is that despite your wins you keep on thinking about the plays you did not make. Been watching GM and Citibank like a hawk for a month. The options were 5 to 10 baggers
G’s ready to be dropped at open 😍
Lmaoooooo those ppl asking questions
Pltr
So he doesn’t fumble his words
imagine not knowing buzzword means
Goodnight Joe. Have sweet dreams!
Does pre-market trading pick up at the same price after-hours ended at? Or does it pick up at where the market closed?  Trying to decide if it's best to take a huge loss in a short right now or roll the dice in pre-market
What the fuck did she do? I was just worried about my put credit spread going worthless.
I've been trying to keep up this past few weeks but I'm way too retarded for this. Should I buy calls right now or straight up put $1K on a limit order for tommorow?
6 months LOL.  $15-20 EOM.
so when do we get stimmy for more stonks
Wow that's it. Bulls fked
THE TROOPS? WHAT ABOUT ICLN
Harris going to give Biden a blowy
Gees Up.
[Watch this!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJjRnKpwDyw) I went from not knowing anything about options to actually understanding them. I recommend watching the whole thing
PLTR!!! 📈📈📈📈📈📈
What do you mean when you say call? I’m still trying to learn all the different phrases used in this sub
Super boring and I’m here for it 🚀
never would happen, unless campaign donations were restricted, and the revolving door between the fox and the hen house (industry, and government regulators) were closed.
Cathie bought in
Some guy’s cousin’s friend who works on wall street I read on a yahoo message board
That’s it???
This is awesome! PLTR is by far my largest holding: thank you for this confirmation bias.
Regardless his boomer brain will not compute.

Bunch of fixing r/sino simps here holy shit. Go ahead and back a country that skins their dogs alive and uses child labor
Why
 CATHIE, our QUEEN, BOUGHT PLTR. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
fuck pj traders panicking because he said ''taxes'' cmon people, he's giving away so much free money, don't be so greedy
Lol
MMs don't like Biden :o
ICLN 🤤
For sure man always have them in my portfolio
he literally said this is a time for insert(every ark industry)
It's a horrible mistake for our economy since that money is literally being misused (like the $10 Pakistani gender studies fund snuck into the last one) and everyone who gets it will be spending it on useless stuff, like T.V.s. 

For those of us who are investing, it's only going to pad our portfolios and hopefully give us a means to keep our heads above water when things crash hard.
PLTR mooning after hours 🤣
If he was investing 800k he was probably fine before and this extra few mill isn't a big deal
TO THE MOON!!!
That $15/hr will be the same as $7.50/hr eoy
Up 5% after hours
Bet
Don't care ban him
I’m an independent but futes would be soaring if the other guy made this speech
PLTR moon mission resumes tomorrow. See what Cathie does to stocks she takes positions in. 🚀🚀🚀
You don’t even know how hurt I am for selling my free PLUG shares at $4
worth 3k tomorrow morning
Only mentioned clean energy once, what a bitcch
As soon as they finalize its booming. I think 50 by end of summer, just need to figure how to make the most amount of money from it
????????????????????
Or don’t work for the waltons
Biden is like EOW peace out
May be PLTR day
132-135 with a Feb expiry
You sold me.... I will be rolling over my 1/15 calls tomorrow into 1/29 calls.... Already got a bag of 1/22 calls....
Can’t believe Biden just shilled ARK and ICLN.  😂😭
Thanks man. Dammit.
ArkInvest ( $ARKW) bought half a million shares of $PLTR. We pumping tomorrow boys.
At least trump answered questions. Dude had the slickest tongue in the game
Wrekt :(
Yessir
omg bro it popped hard
Together, together we can cause the GME short squeeze and create a crisis for Melvin and 🌈🐻.
Is our president a closet bear?
Gooooooo PLTR
Boo! Trump would have answered your stupid questions!
ICLN taking off
GME 🚀🚀🚀
But a large amount of the shares can’t be sold in the short term because they are held by insiders or large institutions that hold for their passive ETFs. So doesn’t that magnify the problem for Melvin and all other shorts?
LOL FORGOT HIS MASK
But how long!
Trump makes me sleepy too
When NET tanks at open, I’m just gonna blame Joe.

They gave me plug at 3.5$
Go cathie gooooo!
hire a fucking speech writer wtf
AMRS is pumping and has been for a while now wow
I don’t think Biden did that
Biden literally didn't say shit
HE DID NOT SAY MARIJUANA
❤❤❤
She bought like 500k shares
That's it?!
Wtf kind of speech was that
my mind is a Sine graph trying to follow these double negatives
He needed to say clean energy some more 😤😤
ICLN PUMPING
Lmao I heard that too
He left because he has to go see how much he made off his gme gains
To be fair, the bar is pretty low right now
BIDON THE DEATH BY DAWN
Guys, He has been secretly talking about GME all this time. "We need to save failing american businesses", who the fuck do you think this means? Buy more and do your part, buyden will do his.
There are opportunities add more along the way as they describe in the article
I was really hoping he would say he was gonna continue to defer student loan payments and interest so I can keep throwing my payment into my trading account. Don’t judge me.
What does 55c mean?
Why does Harris even come out?
I think most of the new stuff is short term trading, day trading, swing trading...not true investing...they’ll be in and out and mostly out...
Sleepy Joe
mine are all green...
Good idea.  This is a decent size cap.  Will check it out.  
Thanks for putting on some credible links.
I heard that
PLTR or nndm
Holy shit PLTR liked something Biden said
I bought that. Those drops never last
Forgot his mask, puts on Biden
Cramer you just showed your hand. Nice!  We are not at all surprised by the username though, you could've hidden yourself better.
Lmao people asking questions and he be like noooooope
It’s a done deal
nice dude what exp date
Damn he didn’t say Tesla once...
Exactly
Is the brick wall behind Biden because its being filmed in his basement?
facts what a fuckhead
Tomorrow is PLTR day... When the fuck Cathy is going to buy RKT :(
ccp upvoting every biden comment
This is going to trigger such a squeeze on PLTR. LEGEND CATHIE
Expiration date? 1/15 ?
 PLTR mooning??
Hey retards stop buying PLTR now. I need to load at 25 SHARP!!!!
So Biden's package contains a lot: [https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/politics/biden-economic-rescue-package-coronavirus-stimulus/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/politics/biden-economic-rescue-package-coronavirus-stimulus/index.html)

But notably, it includes an increase to the minimum wage to $15/hour (not a surprise that Democrats would push for this, but it was not expected in this bill). Obviously some companies won't like this (though others that rely more on consumer spending without minimum wage workers will like it) and it also makes the bill much more difficult to pass. Some say it's a poison pill. We'll see.
This man sounds like an angel after dealing with Trump for 4 years
Lol. Shit...My 1/15 $55cc might actually sell 😧
Fucking dude forgot to take his mask....
At least trump was entertaining
Bring back mango man
50k in on GME. Wish me luck
Most def. Do your part and hype it!!!!!!!!!!! woo hoo!!!!!!!
She’s piloting the rocket ship!!!!!! Letssssss gooooooooooo🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Gahhh. I don’t even know what that means.

joe has nothing on martin sheen
> everything about this company is great

Except their actual apps and games
That was an implicit endorsement of cannabis from Biden (clearly stoned & sleepy)
Did I just read something? I feel like I can't read anything anymore? What is going on? Thank God for voiceapp.
APHA TLRY BB PLTR
I put in a measly $150. Can I still has Happy BB Hour?
That was a weak pump Buyden. Disappointed
Won't be a loss of you put it in gme
"And God protect our troops" You know what else protects our troops? PLTR, that's right. Mooning mission confirmed.
I’ve never felt more tarded than watching him explain his spread sheets.

Oh you misunderstood.. I'm still holding lmaooo
Wagering my first born on BUS
Thank you for your sacrifice
Is he not strong enough to answer questions?
Imagine calling a $15 minimum living wage a poison pill.
Still, I bet it could be challenging cashflow-wise for many, as I'd imagine the mortgage would account for a significant portion of salaries at the time. Or were salaries truly inflation adjusted in those days (unlike today)?
Yes sir. Do you have any recommendations on where I can the knowledge required to go in on calls? Maybe Youtube videos?
50? I'd do it for a two bagger
u/savevideo
Biden is outlining why growth stocks time is over. The rotation to value is starting. BUY **LOWE'S!**
I just heard Joe lowkey market signal Artificial Intelligence along with all the predictable alt energy stuff.

What are y'alls favorite AI industry picks?
Mine was X at around $5.
% in the portfolio
That gives ME confidence... sweet thanks for the confirmation bias
Uh.. spy ah tanking after that speech....
No questions allowed. Lol
I agree about MA crossovers... pretty beginner friendly. I don’t think VWAP is relevant until your account is past the PD rule level, but, hey, to each their own.
It won't matter inflation is getting soo bad it's not gonna make a difference
Well tomorrow is going to suck
Stay on here and look for hyped stocks that seem to have a legitimate reason for big growth in the short term due to a deal, new  product, earnings report, whatever, get in early and try to avoid hopping onto things a day or days after it has been hyped to death. There is a lot more lee way for bad decisions when you get in early.
I am so confused by this meme.  Why not just use options profit calculator
1/15s?
Well that was nothing new. He just made an announcement about future announcements. Did I miss anything?

Bro I fucking love TLRY
I told my friend he better personally endorse ICLN haha
I would pull a boomer move and put 80% of it into fucking VTI
This is why you don't vote Dems  because they will kill your stocks gains and tax the fuck out of you.
What a lame duck...
Cathy Wood buying PLTR guys!!!
# YALL ARE TWEAKING HARD. THAT WAS BULLISH ASF. TOMORROW HULK GREEN DICKS FOR EVERYONE
Papà Biden 💤
Appreciate the advice.  Yes this completely makes sense.  Would this be considered a "pump and dump"?

This was my first year of trading, and I'm learning a lot of lessons the hard way, but at least I was smart enough to only invest a small amount at the beginning and increase my investment slowly over time.  I finished the year with a fairly high growth percentage for 2020, but more importantly I remember most of the lessons I learned.

I've also gotten tuned into some genuine mentors and teachers whos advice has actually panned out consistently for me in the real world.

I think I'm on the right track, but very thankful I didn't take a misstep here and get hooked up with Mr. Brown.

Thanks again!  Happy trading 🤙🏽
50? I'd do it for a two bagger
Cliched garbage speech. All he was missing was “...and maybe, just maybe...we can fix this mess.”
So I sold my GME when it hit 36 so im 📜👐 as fuck but from what ive seen it has serious reason to stand in the 40-50 range short term and long term it will continue rising as daddy RC changes the company. BB went brrr today I think due to the news of it selling patents, gettin some sweet cash to pay off debt with. Im rotating to BB but my largest position is PLTR.
Fuck do I have to start paying my student loans again next month??
I've been drinking a 12 pack of Stella Artois the last couple days and my farts smell absolutely rancid. Never buying this shitty beer again.

I am YOLOing 5k at bb as soon as the market pops.
#ICLN PUMPING!!!
Hey sorry I'm new here, but even if this is a pump and dump, is it still not easy money if you well..pump it and dump it yourself?
Trump hasn’t given a press briefing in over half a year lmao
SPCE and PLTR and GME is my portfolio
They have to, it's absurd that it hasn't been raised since 2009.
Then my comment doesn’t apply?
YOUR NEXT STOCK... EXPR had highest volume is HISTORY today and broke a 3 year trend 

You want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money
What’s the link to look at futures?
Wtf That’s it
ICLN🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🚀🚀🚀🚀
i wish there was a better way of saying that you sold calls that you bought over a year ago. 

selling calls in apple sounded like a really bad idea, but that's not what this is. Congrats and nice job
BB
Holy shit Cramer actually called us out and recommended his viewers to come here lmao fuck 

#rip wsb 😥
https://www.getrichslowly.org/parking-lot-attendant-worth-half-a-million-bucks/

"He's never earned more than $20,000 in a year, yet he has a net worth over half a million dollars."

The math is pretty simple.  A high salary makes it easier, but fundamentally it's just a function of defining a goal and figuring out how to get there.
“Goodnight my fellow Americans!  I have to go trade in some games at GameStop.”
He tries so hard to act like he cares. My subconscious picks up on it immediately.
All lies
Yes buying is highly encouraged but watch out for morning dip like we saw today
Sounds like what you are describing is as the price runs up towards a big OI strike the increasing delta of the short options getting hedged accelerates the move and causes bigger more volatile swings.
No mention or student loan relief? Hmmmmm
So buy more stocks?
This is from the ARK evening newsletter. The 497100 is thr amount of shares purchased. The 0.2xx is the percentage of the portfolio. To the moon boys!🚀🚀🚀
Adding to my Pltr position. This is a work of art.
So what exactly is the plan lol? Anyway we'll moon off the stimulus hopes again 🤣🚀👩‍🚀
Fuck I wanna buy APHA shares so bad
Tesla you hurt me this week - why you gotta do me like that
Was that good enough to get me to the moon? No. However he said green energy twice. I’ll take it Joe but let me wanting

The inflation is going into assets such as stocks, there’s not many options to do. For you though, I suggest to go live in a bunker.

... Theta gang wins!
Depends.  If your huge gains were in TSLA I would recommend getting out now.  I know people don't like to hear it but it's going to happen; just don't get caught thinking it can only go up.

Yes because they bought in when it was too late.

This is the way.

Every clean energy EV stonk from TSLA to butt PLUG gonna rip tomorrow boys

at above 7% or so you are considered to be "beating the market" as the snp500 has an average growth of around that per year. I think warren buffet has managed to average around 17% over the last 40 years. I can't remember the specifics, but that's the ballpark figures of one of the most prolific investors ever.
It will crash you do lol

Any of the ARKs, plus their new ARKX which will be available sometime end of March. 

Cloud computing ETFs like WCLD, SKYY, CLOU

Green energy ETFs like ICLN, PBW, TAN, QCLN

Besides the meme stocks like TSLA, PLTR, NIO, etc...I like SQ, TDOC, and LMND
I mean last time ARK bought 500k of something it was Skillz and that went crazy
Or they sell, realize it's still spiking, buy again... The feedback loop continues

Thank you sir.

Sounds like Joe is gonna spend ALOT of money over the next 4 years. Solving hunger, energy, jobs, raising minimum wage, taxing the wealthy and being more aggressive in vaccine rollout.

I was bullish regardless
Find out how heavily it’s been shorted and post a DD
All bought at GME of course.
69*
I think you shouldn’t listen to Reddit. They always get it wrong.  They got oil wrong the last time and they will get it wrong again.  Let them buy EV stocks.
Same I dig the change of pace
Algos dont understand “fix”
I bought mine in october between 11-15$ and fucking panic sold it all at 31$. I'm a goddamn failure, the guys who bought in on Monday are up as much as I made enduring the stress for like 4 fucking months
There you go ICLN. You fuck

Hmmm strange I just checked and its there for me. Next to "discover"

idk if media coverage for GME squeeze is good or bad lol
It’s almost as if y’all forgot futures are fake and gay
Remember the day 🍑 literally called out company names for the first 30 minutes

Looks like DFV closing his calls didnt affect the market at all
They had 14 and went to 51%
ICLN and GME are going to have to save my portfolio
Did we get green energy or low energy?
What movie is this?
Lol he is not really talking shit, most of the time he is also a degenerate: https://youtu.be/dXq0Swe7k7E
I look in the mirror everyday, and think, “*God, I am fucking ugly...* *I need to get rich...*”
Too situational to answer, depends on the compensation structure of the company
YOUR A FOOL IF YOU ARENT IN GME YET
Preach baby! We takin off!
Additional $1400 announced
Go buy an etf
55 cents. OP thinks if he trades his nickels in for pennies he'll have more money. He's technically right.
$100 end of year without the squeeze. With the squeeze I’m not sure. Tomorrow we have 50k put contacts expiring and 400 million worth of call options that will be exercised if the price ends above $45. That alone could rocket us up to 50+ early next week. Then if short positions start covering $100+ doesn’t seem too off. Time line for that Depends on how long the shorts want to stave off the inevitable
Glad I got rid of my 1/15s for a minimal loss and not lose 100% of them
Fucking hell joe give me my $20 back that I slipped you to talk about plug stocks 🚀🚀
Holy fuck. Fuck I just jizsed in my pants. Where do you people see this? My credit spread is good too go tomorrow.
He said his plans, but basically confirmed.
*anything that goes up*

On a positive news, futures are usually wrong.

WTF is shit with Gold Bless America, fk God in the ass
I missed the talk. Any key points? I make way too much money to qualify for any stimulus checks. Was just looking for something energy or green related. Anything good mentioned there?
This is so true - they can’t understand what we’re saying or what any of it means.  One wandered in here a few weeks ago, saw “FOMO” and started asking what ticker that was.  They’re dinosaurs.

Exactly.  Nobody is moved nor surprised as most of us are nowhere near the extremes.
Post the link to the interview you watched? I need some more fear drilled into me
Biden laying major puts on tech so he can invest in GME
Question: What usually happens to the stock after a short squeeze? I understand us autists and retards want tendies but overall what happens?
Cathy copped 500K shares the day after I finally give up on it lol
i bet she got a nice pink rim around her butthole

For sure, hopefully we gap up to above 20 and it continues the run. The volume this week has been crazy
bought 150shares yesterday at 37...well i guess it’s something
> When calculating your max return on investment when selling a cash secured Put, do you use the full collateral as the denominator or do you use the collateral less the premium earned?

For ROC, the full collateral alone.

FWIW, I prefer to use my early exit loss target, because I'm not going to risk the entire collateral if I can help it. Since less cash is nominally at risk, using the full collateral understates return. So I use the max loss I'm willing to accept on the position before I early exit. That's usually around 20% of the credit collected plus fees/expenses.

> Also, how do you calculate ROI on covered calls?

(*Realized* credit + gains on the shares) / net cost basis of the shares.

Using the initial credit collected overstates the return. It's better to wait until the CC is resolved (for example, you close the short call at 50% of max profit), then calculate your ROI. Gains on the shares may be negative (a loss) if the credit is positive.
I personally dont think premium cost is worth the risk. So I'd buy shares.  [ivs ](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/trading-weekly-options/9781118727386/OEBPS/9781118727386_epub_c_06.htm)

We fucked fam. The market was not impressed.
$55 call
Long live the TikTok kids, our version of 1929's shoeshine boys and 1999's tip giving cabbies. Plenty of gains to be had from the hype if we get out in time.
You're a mad man! Congratulations
the year how can I avoid the short term capital gains tax?

Example purchase 

Jan 1 2020 - $5000 company xyz purchase 
Feb 28 2020 - $5000 company xyz purchase
June 1 2020 - $5000 company xyz purchase 
August 1 2020 - $5000 company xyz purchase. 

Total 2020 returns - 100%. 
Account balance - 40k

I’m assuming I could sell 5k now and it would be considered long term gains and taxed accordingly. 

When does the additional 20k in move from short term to long term?

Is the profit on each of the 4 purchases tracked with that individual purchase or would I have to wait to take any profits until August 1?

Hope this makes sense.
Depends on how the money gets spent
Futures are red after Buyden just told us we all getting stimmies, we are Fuk
Of course, small businesses gotta go!
This is a deep point, completely agree.
Yo why is the CNN lady blinking like that

Congrats to my ICLN holders, time to kick off lads 🚀
I really like dow. It has a great div too!
If you give more money, won’t the poverty line go up? CALLS ON POVERTY
Considering we live in a universe where fundamentals no longer have any meaning, does anyone have an actual price target for GME? Could this thing pull a TSLA and rocket 5x from where it is just because it's a meme and we are pumping it?

I'm thinking about jumping in at $42 if people think it has room to run.
The dude clearly has dementia.  I doubt he has many memorable years left before his mind is completely gone.
The DD i was looking for
He has the range for both
Idk I was dumping thousands of $ in March and my balance was down 30%.
WOW the resistance on ICLN is so strong! 

(trying to jinx it to go to $40)
Short term (aka tomorrow) it's a great thing.   


Long term? Mmm....
Then it would probably be best to sell the calls and buy shares

I thought I read one of the first things he was gonna do once he got into office was extend the loan payment pause

[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loan-payments-pause-biden-extend/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loan-payments-pause-biden-extend/)
This is what tech gets for sucking Biden off. Here you go fuckers. He turned around and fucked you.
If you’re not all in GME you’re a joke
Student loan interest/payments will probably get pushed back to September

Getting rid of any student loan debt is so far down the list of things needed lol
I dunno, the bumbling idiot was more entertaining than the puppet
Seems like only 10k will be relieved in his 2nd relief package. However, he can use the treasury to relieve all of it by executive order...so we’ll see if he gets pressured to do it.
I think if he learned to YOLO small amounts (100 bucks on a contract on a solid thesis) he would learn to not sell immediately at the first sign of normal intraday volatility. I bet he uses all his day trades up fucking selling at a $20 loss.
That robot already exists. No joke.

My dad retired from 28 years in the Air Force. He does inventory at Wal-Mart 4 days a week and loves it. Works before most other workers/customers get there in a small team. He also gets joy by bothering his HR department about every overreach or stupid thing his bosses do.

He 100% doesn't need the job but really likes the physical and social aspect of getting up and going in to work.
Hello sir, this is James with the SEC. do you have a minute to chat?
Cramer said today that the shorts are still at 140% ( where do they see this total they keep spouting?  I can only find daily info ).
Where are you guys reading that Ark bought more PLTR? I own a shit ton of shares and was baffled by AH.

I have no idea.. Ive been shitting on GME for the last 2 months, but decided to hop on when it was like $18.

Now that I've made quite a bit on it, Im just gonna follow DFV and do whatever he does. He seems to know his shit, and it looks like he doesn't plan on it stopping. Especially if there's a short squeeze.
Say now chad how do I find this rawdit on my smarty phone?

That's it. I'm officially fucked tomorrow.

Been nice knowing you guys
How tf am i supposed to know that lol. That’s why I’m asking.
No fucking 🧢, our 🤴🏻, lead the way
y'all look retarded as fuck saying WhY Is ICLN NoT MoOnInG

&#x200B;

its a fucking ETF you mouth breathers
Im cumming
I literally sold calls against my shares at 25.5 strike so I can try and dump them, I guess that’s what’s going to happen lol.
for real, that was good
Thanks for filling in some the back story. If he was indeed fired for violating a policy before it was policy then that doesn't seem fair to him.

My comment was mainly to highlight that the gender of the employee wasn't relevant. One of my pet peeves is when people use the word female to describe people when it really isn't germane to the point. For example if someone said  "I was pulled over by a female police officer for speeding!" What does it matter that the police officer was a woman? Why do I need to know that?

Sorry for the rant :).
I’m still pissed about it
I'm bearish on PLTR but might play some 0DTE calls tomorrow. ARK just bought half a million shares

ARKW 01/14/2021 Buy PLTR PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC 497,1000
I mean I’m retarded so what I say doesn’t matter but I get the vibe that the market was kiiiiinda hoping for a massive fuckin package with a blue senate. $1.9T with absolutely nothing retroactive is probably a let down to a lot of people lol
>Mt. Dew is gnarly.

Gnarly

Rad

Awesome

Any of these words work.
I don't understand fully why, but apparently options aren't a great choice right now just because of the IV. That being said, I still bought a Jan22 $30c for 2.5 a share because i personally think that'll print.
Why because it's cheap?
Where do I RSVP for the short squeeze
Someone got triggered
i know trump was verrry orange but this new guyvis verrry borrring
Holy shit wtf yeah what is she doing? Is it morse code?

It will be sad to not have a smartass in the office but at least we won’t have to worry about civil war
I was wondering how people felt about SNDL i was thinking get while its cheap but why is it so cheap still
How's everyone enjoying their nothingburger? Anything else we can get for you tonight?
What if the shorts come out tonight and says it’s worth $15.. are we fucked?
I kinda want to get laid off.....the fuck
Becoming a millionaire every day
Couldn't wait for tomorrow, AH bought:

Is an AH buy right now retarded?
That was 100% written by a speech writer.. you think he wrote that? Lol
She bought it 🥰
The fuck are futures red for? Fuck this market honestly...I lose $70K playing short positions over the last 2 months and now it's not green on stimulus news when I finally go balls deep in weekly calls? Bullshit dude, I'm done

137C gotta print next week playa
BUYDEM ICLN CALLS TMRW
Clearly Cathie hates Citi
I’d take $330
😂 make sure you post your loss porn over at r/wallstreetbets
Relax a bit
Lol.... We going to lose money on ICLN huh?
Up 6% in the AH, love it.
😂😂😂😂🐃🐃🐃🐃✊🏽🍆🍆🍆💦💦🐻🐻🌈
Will be happy to hear more advice, this made so much fucking sense.im surprised it didn't blow up, great job
It means 55 calls which is like ur betting the stock will go beyond 55$ at a certain date.
I want you to be right so bad
Same, hoping it crashes early tomorrow so I can get in at a better price.
A lot
Fcel what the FUCK r u doing
beautiful clean coal
TSLA tests its cars. 

Bullish either way. TSLA calls.
Why are u guys mentioning Cathie bought PLTR now and not during market hours 🤦‍♂️
Then my 1/22 calls should print me tendies
Guaranteed tendies. God speed brother.
Lol, I was too excited I messed up the title the first time
Lol why
Thank you. I was trying to post this. Sound the war drums boiz!!!!! We're in 🚀🚀🚀🚀
What are you even in
Why’s that?
Any one have more detail on the Cali Supreme Court ruling today on gig workers rights? I saw they ruled in favor of them but can’t find anymore info. 

And more specially why did dash boost in AH on what should be bad news for them, fucking POS.
>  Roughly half of the companies in there would be expected to outperform the s&p, over any given period

Not accurate. Most gains are from a handful of companies at any given time. We often have situations where S&P 500 goes up while 400 of the companies underperform it.
Live stream??
Didn’t they already have shares? Or is this the first time?
MODS
Fuck I wish I grabbed these instead of shares today. I was thinking about it but had to leave for school so said fuck it and bought some shares to be safe.
Why is everyone hypung clean energy? You retards cant understand that its bullish AF for oil??

Regulation=higher cost & lower production

Trump inflated oil supply with less regulation

Regulation+reopening=OIL TO THE FUCKING MOON
#SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT WEBULL BUT THE GME COMMENT SECTION IS GOLD. Same with StOcKwIts.
That's the life of FDs. I don't know if it's ever worth it except for the bragging rights
Re-dosing his meds
One is more powerful
Yes!!! I've been so focused on GME today I went to look at a few of my other holdings and saw I'm up for the day on PLTR like $500? Wha? 

Cathie is the straw that stirs the drink baby!
Can't believe he was on time. Fuckin nutty skill move I haven't seen from a president in years.
There are a lot of people that are anti Amazon. How often do you come across a Nintendo store or a Sony store? The physical locations also drive up a demand for online purchases. And if those other companies decided too, they would probably make a bunch of money by selling their merchandise through a GameStop store, be it online or in a physical store. GameStop is like a staple gaming shop. I’m not saying that the other businesses wouldn’t be better. All I’m saying is GameStop has potential for growth especially after falling so low.
APHA is at a serious discount now. Why would anyone buy Tilray at this point!?

I'm hoping to hold out until the merger is finalized and APHA shares are converted to Tilray to capitalize on the current APHA discount. Hopefully, it can hang on that long and keep rising!
It’s the squint
🚀🚀🚀 

Based on that speech
Aunt Cathie is a giant whale, where ever she moves all the fish follow.
Sad end

Gme got me from its nostalgia and hope. Who gives a crap about another failing clothing retail store with zero surprises.

Just bought 2000 shares. Got fucked on GME. Was in with 1600 shares and hit my stop loss and sold at only 55% gains. Let’s fuel this ship. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Leave ICLN alone. I swear to god if u scare ICLN from mooning 😤😤
Mods...
This post literally made my wife impressed that I’m balls deep in PLTR. She found this so relevant that she might even let me watch her fuck her boyfriend tonight.
I really hope msft tanks after earnings again and then goes flat for a few days, I need a 10 bagger with those calls
It needs to stay above $1 for a while or face delisting so there's that
f
lmao you mad
None of this was news. It leaked publicly at least an hour before he spoke
Tim Apple
CNBC doin the pump
So did sleepy Joe cuck our calls for tomorrow or what?
That seemed like a whole lot of nothing but do we think ICLN will pump tomorrow or nah
Isn't their cheapest vehicle going to be like $80,000?

Theta crush tomorrow
Ngl, expected much more today.
It was the same thing leaked around 3 today
Lol that's a sad pump
Today was a red day I thought. Everything I own was red except for ARKK and so was the S&P 500 and QQQ.
How
obviously. fire them and hire new ones.
Reverse that last thought for the coming week and then roll into PLTR after squeeze
Where??
She's adding meme stocks. We are in control.
It pisses me off that Biden doesn’t make my calls his first priority. He works for me damnit
Putting more into SHG :)

> 50% upside for GME

IMHO this severely underestimates the remaining upside if a true squeeze happens now that the shorts are fully locked in (with new friends) and not exits are left.   

Exhibit A:  https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1349435914632749058
What broker is this?
Market is bullish but... USD plummeting, inflation....
Futures going red is fine - probably for the best. Means the open market will be very green.
Good thing the only calls I got today was APHA
Cathy! My pltr calls thank you
How much more will GME go up?
APHA leaps better retirement plan than vtsax
If I wasn’t all in on Fitbit calls I would
This for real? Lmao. Aunt Cathie is leading us into the depths of Mars! Fuck Citi, they will be the new Melvin

We’re up 6% AH  so I think we’re ok
It depends but increasing purchasing power at this time is much more important than keeping wages low.

Hestia Capital (Investment Firm) made a SEC filing today. They bought ~1 mil shares of GME over the last few days as high as $31. The available float keeps getting smaller and smaller🚀🚀🚀
continue to load up on TSM. Continue to profit from my TLRY calls.
Tell that to the people that would rather go Yolo with their monthly payments instead of feeding uncle Sam.
Yes
Sorry... I mean all I see are green candles, so it must continue to be green.
Pltr to tha moooon.
Let’s fucking ride
At the rate GME is going, WSB will buy out reddit in a week and we can say bad words again
WSB misses the hyperbolic asshole pumping markets whereas Biden is a little more reserved. 

Futures down 0.02% and WSB lambasts the man.
More like Joe Boring
Its a long position, you didn't miss it. It's just getting crazy volume right now for some reason. It will come back down.

If he was 45 minutes late like orange man always used to be, futures would have liked it more.
Holding long but with gme exploding and the BB being the next target I might have to dip out
Wait until he’s actually president
Nobody: 

Biden: May god protect our troops 

Troops: 🤔

We goin to war boys!
Yeah they are pretty sketchy, I try to always stick with shipped and sold by amazon. Hell, I recently bought SSDs on amazon, and whoever has the 3070 in stock without the ridiculous upsell is getting the business. Probably will be Amazon.  


But if you look and best buy, newegg, walmart, probably tiger direct, they all have "marketplace" items and shipped and sold by them items.  


If GME goes this route then you're still dealing with sketchy electronic purchases.  


I used to buy my computer components at Fry's Electronics. Now they're basically trash. If GME is trying to sell computer parts or prebuilts they're competing with already established brands like newegg, tiger direct, ibuypower, maingear, orgin, cyber power, etc etc.
God damn blood in the water. Time to EAT
You should just leave now you’re going to lose your $60
Lol wtf PLTR
Poor baby.

Cathie bought some PLTR today. I'm all in!

Is it still smart to buy at this point?
“Yea, but you never get a good look at her tits tho...”
What are you buying at open?
It’s my free stock, figure I’ll ride this pony into the ground or make a handful of pennies. Today’s return was .07! (3%).

I just started selling covered calls myself. I've been bag holding RKT for a while. I can't wait for my CCs to be assigned at 23.5. ICLN has done better than expected too. I'm in a PMCC with a 22c LEAP, but I need to roll out the sold 32c next month.

You’re bad at this. 

This entire sub is up 100% in GME. Have you been on a ventilator the past two months??
Will it ever?
Aside from DFV, what are some quality recommendations for youtube dd subs?
Instead of selling, you could just rotate into lower risk stocks that won't do as bad in a crash (try to focus on sectors like necessary consumer spending with companies like Walmart, Target or healthcare stocks).
"OIL TO THE FUCKING MOON" = higher oil prices = higher clean energy indices.

You are an idiot.
800 @.91   10x$2C 4/16
Personally I think Oil could be one of the best performing sectors in 2021, beating even tech. Tech will likely enter a bear market after seeing such rapid growth in 2020. Clean energy will not be a good performer either simply because of the massive run up in 2020. Oil on the other hand is going to be a real growth from purely fundamentals. First, oil sector is not over valued, it is either fair value or under valued. Second, with COVID being vaccinated, demand for fossil fuels will soar as people return to normal daily activities (driving to work, going on vacation, shopping, going out on the weekend). Remember, most clean energy is focused on the electric power gen sector, not transportation. The current amount of EVs currently on the road is tiny in comparison to traditional fossil fuel powered cars. Also, as you said, the stimulus will allow people to travel especially during the summer months.

Extremely bullish on oil stocks.
yeah cure my portfolio from losses

Are you sure that you must have earned income? I'm actually pretty curious about this because I couldn't find anything on the IRS site about the details other than the cap limits. 

I was under the impression that spouses without a job can contribute to a ROTH and certain funds like alimony would count - well - because I have friends in that situation. I would have expected day trading gains which are taxable to count. I saw that it was possible to even treat non-tuition stipend payments for contributions.
Thank you. Someone said it.
Nah man. Who buys stocks large in part?  Not retail buyers, but companies via buy backs.  You think an inflated dollar in the hands of joe shmo American is going to stocks?  No way.  Why are things getting more expensive when technology is decreasing the cost to produce?

That's a bad wrap, I bought at 38 and it's 42 now. I've invested slowly over the last few months into Apple (thinking long term investments) but I want to try and ride whatever train is going up right now. I have 1200 in GME due to the rise today, but I wasn't sure if it' was going to go up tomorrow or BB. I'm not a trader by any means, just lurking and trying to learn.
APHA calls someone?
😂😂 I sold a few of these myself. Don't have the balls you do with that many contracts though
This is a simplified version because I don't know enough to give you anything more lol. There are other factors that influence the price of an option and are referred to as "the greeks" because they're named after letters from the greek alphabet. You'll see people mention delta, theta, IV (implied volatility) and others. All those play into the cost of an option. 

As the stock price gets closer and closer to hitting strike prices you'll see the price of that option go up because it's more likely to expire ITM (in the money). 

I forgot to clarify that in my example you'd be selling the options before the expiry date. You're profiting off the option premium and not the stocks themselves. Most people, to my knowledge, do this because not many people have the capital to exercise their calls. 

Let's say I bought one Tesla call with a strike price of $800 and the stock is now $1000. If I want to exercise the option I'd need $80,000 (800*100) in order to do so. I don't have 80K laying around so I'd sell before and collect the premiums from the options. If I did have 80K around and I exercised I would then immediately flip those 100 shares for $200 profit each for a total of $20,000. My profit would look like $100,000 - ($80,000 + cost of buying call) = profit.

“a thing that arouses activity or energy in someone or something; a spur or incentive.”
Example:
"if the tax were abolished, it would act as a stimulus to exports"
More money => more spending => more jobs 

Also minimum wage and average wages are so low everywhere they’ve increased the minimum wage (to substantially lower than where it was in the 90’s with inflation) it has only shown an increase in jobs in recent years

Many more got in based on the overnight "get in at open - it's hititng a record" when, in fact, it nose-dived again.  
People deserve warnings that this stock is bad and this fraud is just pumping.

You obviously don’t know what the hell you’re talking about. Businesses all of a sudden can’t afford handle doubling their employees wages lol doesn’t mean they just can turn on a switch and poof everyone gets 15 an hour.

What actually happens is lots of those jobs have already been destroyed from Covid and arnt coming back so businesses will just raise the wages of their current staffing but not hire more people thus in the end - costs stay the same, but fewer people are in the workforce.
Better start considering whether you prefer smooth or chunky PB.

TSLA gang we will eat next week. We are in a cup and shoulders position now. And it is building up to next week. He will tell us his infrastructure plan next week. And that will include clean energy and EVs is part of that. 


Just remember, cup and balls pattern means it is bulding up and will moon soon, dont worry
ARKQ time
US and Russia own 90% of the nukes. Come get some
Get the notifications, they're amazing to see
Nice to see Cathie also doesn't give a fuck about what Citi says about PLTR
Ryan cohen needs more minorities on his GME board if he wants that sleepy joe $$$

Also just looked his up, didn’t see it. Most of our info is the same, but he’s missing the big strategy behind the CEO
I don’t think Biden was elected because he’s a Catholic lol.
BuT wHaT AbOuT tHe TarIFfS? Lol. USA burned almost to the ground in the soace of 4 years, by a senile clown cult leader...
I was gonna say, $500k is like a penny to ARK
Lockdowns already did that.
I sold $26 c calls today.
We rock
#CATHIEEEEEEEEEEE
Yup
The right year*
What day is apha going to merge?
Stag, O, PFLT, LTC, HRZN, GAIN, PSEC
VSAT and SATS both up 10% today.  Can't get internet on space station without satellite broadband.
Tesla testing ATH tomorrow?
Put a clown beside their names
PLTR👁👄👁💦
Raising income limits in stimmy payments super bullish
GME 🚀🚀🚀
this is not even the first time they’ve bought PLTR..
I assume this is sarcasm right? Everything is the next ten bagger. We are all millionaires
Upvote if the 99% down 0.01 1/15 leaps you bought last year stop making your portfolio look poor tomorrow
How likely is pltr going to hit 50 this year?
>"What car do you drive?"

2011 Nissan Xtrail
This aged well.  Hopefully tomorrow, it's to $50 we go
He's probably talking about cciv aka cc4
Your DD series has changed lives. Mine just a little, but others quite substantially. Thanks for this.
That isn't what the OP is asking about. They're talking about zillow buying the house from them to sell to someone else.
look up volkswagen short squeeze of 2008
Yeah he isn’t a politician
good luck homes
Time to get back on PLTR boys 📈

I'll be fucking buying more PLTR tomorrow, again.
Please solar go up tomorrow

You best bet this is going in an office email tomorrow. Amazing work! 🚀🚀🚀
> Does anyone else inexplicably hate the phrase, "I/we started my/our FIRE journey."

Yes

I also dislike the FI/RE "movement." It's really just spending less than you earn and then investing the difference. That's it.
Don’t you still get taxes on the options income though?
Getting in tomorrow. Hopefully not too late :/
I sold my 100 plug shares. Too soon ?
The market had absolute retard strength no matter what the news is until I bought. Now it doesn't even have the strength of an ant.
What did i say guys? BTFD PLTR
until rent goes up for low income people because they can afford it
Futures green by open
Deep fucking value excercising his ITM calls after market close Friday will single handedly squeeze them. My plan, hold till mid next week or when my $420 sell order hits, whichever comes first
Ye 1/15. Bought yesterday or so for fun
Lucky for me I loaded up
Better get in on GEVO now
give me the call strike fam
860C and not all, but an annoying chunk that I made this week... Went to make a quick flip on them today and got sucker punched cause I didn't sell early
I'm mildly surprised that you tards actually got this POS to squeeze and are lucky that RC took an interest. If not for RC this thing should've gone to BK eventually. Will be interesting to see if RC can actually turn it around.  I guess don't underestimate retard strength. Congrats to the true believers who've been in for over a year. Unbelievable
U on that good stuff just like sleepy joe. PLTR baby 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
LMAO SPY tanking. Thanks buyden
For fuckin real??
I was not at all wrong about CHEK. I made the video at $0.55 and it's still 3x from there.


I do not know why the FDA IDE information has been released. We know the application was filed with the FDA on Nov. 18, and the FDA website says they take 30 calendar days to process the IDE application. There has simply been no PR on it. I cannot control that, but my research was sound, publicly available, and correct.


Also, regarding ZOM, I didn't call a price. I simply said I did not like the company and gave the reasons why. You can say that's wrong, if you want, but it is what it is.

10k in ICLN leaps better treat me right 🤪
It's gotta pop eventually.. Lockout ends in February, so thinking it gets better or worse, and if it gets worse, I think they'll start doing their buy back.

PLTR 7% AH! WHAAAAAA
YOUR NEXT STOCK... EXPR had highest volume is HISTORY today and broke a 3 year trend 

You want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money

i will, i am going to put all my savings into BB because i have faith in this gang. don't worry ill be loyal
so ICLN mooning tomorrow right?😛
It is okay to take losses if you see a play that will actually make money. Invest on odds and logic not emotion

I sold 150 shares to buy some MT calls and BFT....atleast they’re printing 😭🤧 but still sad
wtf I can't be naked when I sell short? But I'm in my own house!

Yes, actually. I’ll take this over what we’ve been having for 4 years.
taxes, minimum wage are the main negatives

Nice on your home? How many panels?
Borrowed stocks have to come from somewhere though I thought. And if you have an active order on your shares, they can't be borrowed, so they have to be bought. I could be dumb af though.
I only own BB, BBBY, GME, PLTR, ICLN.. all of them are mooning I'm getting nervous
The libfolio, ultimate play rn
no sry
That’s why the movie ends with a fade away from TSLA in the red. Leaves an opening for the sequel covering the Tesla crash and potentially an overall market crash. Or it’s about how Burry was way to early and every skyrockets. Nobody knows but history shows the longer you hold the better.
Close your eyes and go all in BB it’s a no brainer, this shits got a rocket strapped to its back

Cause it’s a legitimate stock. Not a pump and dump like gamestop
A very famous youtuber by the name of TheWalrus Steert is making a video on it on Sunday. He is the one that brought BNGO and CHEK to light. He the one that trashed ZOM as well. Look him up.
I had 3,000 shares I bought at $6 and sold at $11 back in like 2016 and remember arguing with people on whether NVDA was over valued at $90
Ima just keep holding and selling calls OTM calls.  I'm gonna prolly start buying up some BB tommorrow.  I agree with WSB on this one that its undervalued and alot of potential.  Prolly like a couple grand tommorrow and if it pulls back, buy more.  

I still like Ford for now, but it might trade flat for the next few days so ima sell calls and use the premium to buy BB.  If I can get BB under 10 ill buy leaps otherwise just shares and see what happens.
ICLN up 1% now. Saved you a google
Got less institutional player weight, more uptick potential. Return wise either or would probably be fire tho depending on if you go contracts. Shares I’d do ICLN no doubt
If it hits 50 my delta is gonna be yuge

Did he mention weed? Weeds gapping up definitely mentioned it very nice sleepy joe now pass that stimmy.
Owning a share means you own a piece of the company that was sold by the founders of the company at some point to raise capital.

In a lot of ways it's similar to owning gold/cash since it only has value since people say it has value.  The difference being that the 'value' changes over time for different reasons.  They're just another thibg people trade that has value.
Lol I’m glad I held apha weeklies
ICLN startles easily, *u have to be very calm*
I got 3 kids where do I wagered them at?
Well I'm still holding (from $32). From what I've been reading everywhere, the squeeze hasn't even started, and the stock is up 6% after hours now. So yes, it will 🚀🚀🚀🚀. My person exit point is $499.99
GME
as if companies aren't already doing as much as possible to reach automation get a clue
**Serious question: what is the play for 1/15 GME calls tomorrow?**
Your first problem was ever buying T...
I’ve been waiting for you PLTR 😉
Three days of preparation for this speech. What a nothingburger. Lol
So as a noob that's just beginning to understand calls and puts. If on that day say, the stock hits $20. The what do you do? Say it hits 20 on the 18, what's the move then? I'm trying to understand where the money comes from. If I understand, you would exercise that option and then technically speaking you owe the amount of $ the stocks are worth right? Do you then sell right away? Sorry if it's a confusing question
LMFAO this dude sold at fucking 20, the day before the massive run-up.

> In a regulatory filing, GameStop disclosed that its director James Wolf sold 810K shares of common stock on January 12th in a total transaction size of $17.19M

Retards!!!!

Its a $1,000 stock. They are signing contracts left and right. 36 countries. What is getting published? NOTHING!!!! Why banks downgrading it??? Why retards????? Citi clown Tyler Radke mops the floor at Citi Group, "downgraded" from $9 to $15. MM buying big time.
TYME has a new drug called "SM-88". It's in Phase 2 of 3. They're doing a presentation at ASCO gastrointestinal cancers symposium on January 17th.

Down .04% is literally the dumbest definition of tanking I’ve ever heard. Congrats on that
ah, muchas gracias
I think most of the time it's employers who determine wages not the employee. Most people making minimum wage are stuck making it, they didn't decide to just be economically fucked over their whole lives. When Walmart and Amazon are forced to pay decent wages then our taxes can stop paying for all the welfare those employees need to survive since they are being held below the poverty line.

I was considering buying the twitter dip, but given the recent leaks I guess it's all downward from here. I hope $SNAP bounces back, as I do have quite a bit of shares of that stock.

You're not just giving up some money, you're giving up a lot. They buy the property, do pretty minor cosmetic work, and then flip it. If they were giving you a good offer they wouldn't make any profit.

If legit want to exercise the call then yes.  If you dont have the funds then it will expire and you get the difference. Whats your strike price?
Yes get this shit stock PLTR over $28. I want the dumbass to exercise the calls so I can get rid of this crap.
You mean , when is it going to hit $50 tomorrow? Prob before lunch!
Biden said “We will finance the stimulus through AFRM for 0% interest”
PLTR $26.65. Fuck you bears!
We are, by investing in GME!!
Lol so what did u make out with cuz it ain’t lookin good so far if u held
fyi i'm long 100 shares
When exactly do you purchase?
Guys don’t fall for the trap, PLTR will be red by 1100
Ive been in this stock for 2 months and I only have 4 hairs left on my head like Homer Simpson
Nice.
Blow my load on that big ass BB
Spend a lot of money. More stimulus. Tax the rich. Re-invest in a new American Revolution with clean energy and innovation.
1. You make stuff you think is nice and it’s well made and you put a lot of effort in
1. You setup an Etsy account
1. Profit?

That's technically illegal; don't do this with a big position or the SEC might fry you.

don't forget the Paris Agreement pump on 1/21/2021 when Biden rejoins the USA as he promised on Day 1
WhiSH I would have bought more , took out gains from GME and bought only a TLRY 19C LOL
Didn't catch the speech why are y'all so bearish rn
Guys... an EFT DOESN'T MOON

Politics shouldn’t be entertaining
Bb
More taxes but also clean energy. I think it just cancels each other out. Sideways for next few months
It was a speech about how he’ll talk about everything at another time
Yes. It left the stimmy pretty much up to our imagination
Excuse me, where’s the lobby?
Yeah no worries there’s some good posts that explain that a bit better. I got in a $20 but now have some money to DCA up
This $2 trillion stimmy package is just a start, like an appetizer. The real thing will come in the spring and be much bigger.
He calls for more stimulus money, more unemployment, more manufacturing.  Brief mention of clean energy.
Are MSFT fuk?
Thanks for that $SENS heads up! Hopefully it holds until market open!
one dem in senate is all it takes. The WV dem is basically a republican
He’s more entertaining than any politician, I think that’s a known fact whether you agree with him or not
There's about a 100% chance it hits 50 this year
He’s beyond KING!! He’s KING aannnd QUEEN!
That walk at the end of his speech tho, guys's exhausted, puts on his health
APHA just kissed $13 omg,  my PT is $16 tomorrow.   🚀🚀🚀

Up 7%
Stock market to the moon ✅ LFG🚀🚀🚀
Might be too early to say definitively, but Biden’s stimulus speech seemed like a nothing burger. 

RIP OTM 1/15 options.
You obviously don’t understand how solar works. There are two types of inverters for a solar array:

1) Micro-Inverters. Enphase. They put an inverter on EACH panel. The DC current output of each panel is inverted to AC individually.

2) Central Inverters: SolarEdge, SMA, soon to be Tesla. The DC output from the ENTIRE array goes to a single CENTRAL inverter and is inverted to AC. These commonly include POWER OPTIMIZERS on each panel but this is different from a micro inverter.

Tesla is coming out with their own CENTRAL INVERTER. Nowhere do they say micro-inverter. Central inverters have specific kW sizes and Tesla will be coming out with a sub 3 and sub 7 kW micro-inverter. Look it up dude.
For future historians: humanity has become a meme. Nothing makes sense, and this is who we are as a specie

Whoaaaaa interesting comment
You don't think they'll be driven even harder by having to pay their minimum wage employees more? Get a clue
Lol. I’m kidding about the paper trading. But I did post some of my positions just now in another comment. Mostly boring covered calls and csp on half meme and half boomer stocks
you forgot to mention the most important piece

"Ryan Cohen replacing Kamala Harris as VP"

and "GameStop being given 500 billion to develop EVs"

Man I feel like shit today which is a shame since I have such good gains
I'm not sure if Woodforest is near you but you might check with them. I think they still use chex, but I know they've done accounts for people on chex that might bank denied.
Yeah I've shares and couple calls expiring July
Nice to watch a politician speak that has a hopeful message.
Boooo
My only holdings right now are BB and Apple, but I am very worried cuz right know Apple is performing like a typical boomer stock. I am very bullish and expect historic earnings, but I am not sure if the market will move much. Why are you so confident that Apple could reach 150 by Feb 19?
My leaps are hungry
They’re already >$42.
Biden? More like BiDump
Post it on palantirtech twitter acct
These ICLN bags are leaky motherfuckers. Should’ve sold Monday or rolled. Sad.
This didn't work out the way you wanted it to.
40 1/29 $130 Apple and 12 1/15 $860C TSLA... 

I could be ok but I just have a horrible feeling after Bearden said the corporate 'T' word... and how the market reacted over all today plus futures and the shit AH movement
Please do my calls would appreciate it 🙏
yugely
Hopefully, this is just the iBeginning
not touching this POS again. No.
Because of this I’m hanging on to my pltr calls.
PLTR, BB, GME. Quit worrying bro
This is also about crushing Melvin Capital, seeing them driven before you, and hearing the lamentation of their wives' boyfriends' sidechicks.
Better than the OG

Lol. Thank you, brother! I did hit higher highs today. I rolled most to next weeks 55C at cost. I took a couple grand off the table (to buy Luigi’s Mansion and a Switch), but I am all in pretty much. I think this short squeeze is just getting started and margin calls will be happening a lot tomorrow and early next week. Price target is $80+. Good luck out there, brother!
You’d have to buy the 100 shares the option represents to exercise it, most people don’t have the capital to do that
Let me tell you a couple of three things first half of sopranos s6 is a complete waste ...Melvin bank never had the makings of a varsity athlete .

Because GME stole the spotlight.
Honestly unless you’re at a point where you’re trying to retire or need supplemental income because you’re traveling don’t invest too heavily in dividend stocks. I’ve bought and sold Bitcoin too but I won’t buy more unless it hits 18K again. I’m fine with the gains I prefer investing in the market where I can actually do DD on a company or industry lol. If you’re young and trying to grow your portfolio with lower risk I’d recommend ETFs. They remove the risk of a particular stock going down due to issues within the specific company, instead you’re exposed to several companies within that sector so unless that entire industry fails you’re okay. I’m shooting for higher growth so willing to accept some risk. I’m in a lot of ARK ETFs. If you want dividends stay away from stocks that do not have a good 5 year growth rate of beating the market. Some companies with great dividend yields just do not have much potential for growth. Shoot for a .04-.05% yield in blue chips like Home Depot, & AT&T. Big companies whose value is known and isn’t as reactive to news. If you need additional income you can sell far OTM covered calls as well.
ICLN always green AH then dump -3% after open
Once news gets out everyone is gonna but pltr 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Bro this is such a clear diversion away from GME, ah shit
That’s good timing and you’ve done well there. 3xStocks I only hold for 1 week max as they always want to return to a base level. Still they can be hugely powerful so well done. My best was on before NYE and I made 50% on a day trade. Thank you 3x leverage. 

The risk was incredibly low, the probability of opportunity to do the trade was extremely low!

O yeah for sure I think I’ll be holding gme at least until next Tuesday just a day to day thing right now cause shit be crazy.

I love you Cathie...You smart, kind and very nice, and you know the power of PLTR holding. To tha moon.
What should I buy
Don't worry, they'll get shook out after the next big dip. They come and go with the market, once they lose big, only the diamond hands will remain. They'll definitely lose big, because they don't know what they're doing and listen to us retards.
yes, because I bought a call today
My hope for the stimulus / infrastructure bill...


“You can pick up your check when you return this shovel...”
Mama Cathie is the best. Diamond hands these PLTRs to the moon.
I was about to rip you for that avatar but then i saw you also got ass raped by GUHEV 

Welcome to the wounded veterans club soldier
Right? Lol
You’re a retarded genius friend
I’m holding til I land on the moon
PLTR IS JACKED TO THE TITS AFTER HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What’s the catalyst for my boi PLTR in AH?
i dont know
THought we elected Biden turns out we got Bidet
Did Buyden said any thing about ICLN?
LMAO
Best thing you’ve ever done for yourself. Been Facebook and Instagram free for four years now.
🤦‍♂️
Yup so is Amazon
I was right, but Biden isn’t a good hypeman
yes, unfortunately, they need to stop making money in order to pump their stock up

profitable companies are for boomers and gay bears
Thank you so much for this. The perfect song to play every day before opening bell 🔔!!!!!
think BAC will moon tomorrow?
What makes you say that? You’d think they’d have popped more on stimulus deets. Gonna take the night to digest it I guess. PM will be exciting.
Any news on PLTR or why is it mooning AH?
good cuz even though im holding long term ive been losing faith lately lol
What are you using for these calls? I'm pretty new to all this.
Puts on Spokane. Estimated power outages until Sunday
PLTR we fly
Yes
Palantir 😭📈🚀


I definitely always believed in you don’t look at my other comments in this thread bb <3
Dude would pump the market with vague positivity the call the top once a month and fuck everyones calls. Welcome to stability bitches
whew sold my 30c and half my 40c for gme and bought 2 55c for fun let's see how this rides tomorrow
Why tf is GME popping so much though
ok legit, stick with GME or go BB? Some people are saying go BB and I have no idea what to jump to.
which ones? snp hasnt dropped all that much?
About time cathie got on board. There better not be any more plant ear deniers left in here.
Long time idiot, first time posting. can you teach us what you mean about limit orders?
most educated reply on wsb here.
Eh gradually this would happen but not by the amount their wage went up. Rent will also increase regardless.
After what GME did to me idk how much longer i can last 🚀🚀🚀🚀
PLTR.  BB will go down a bit before pushing up towards 15
sell the news
Yea guys pack it up, people in the Reddit comments say it’s bad so it’s over.

Y’all don’t know what the hell you’re talking about. You know what’s worse than inflation? A depression. And that’s where we’re heading without the constant supply of stimulus through this incredibly tough economic time. 

I swear some of you all just study or Google theory without understanding the full scope and application of solutions
1.9 trill stimmy is nothing?
Bb
I picked the wrong week to sell CC on APHA 🤨
Thank you for your answer, it helps a lot! So just a clarification question, when you say not to exercise, do you mean to sell back that contract for a higher premium? And if so, would that potentially put you the red as it puts the sellers obligation on you and whoever buys may choose to exercise?
I'm balls deep in PLTR and this just got my dick hard. I ain't gay
It says in post, Bidens talks his long term goals in Feb. Infrastructure is included, VALE produces iron ore to steel makers $$$$🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Isn’t 2 trillions a lot of money so why aren’t we pumping
A truly shameful display, really. I feel incredible sadness for you and your family, which must be grieving for your soul, even though you are still walking the mortal plane of existence.
For sure. He answered every question. Even if he had no clue.

I liked the he just said whatever his dumb brain was thinking
Yeah I thought Biden had a very positive future outlook and plan while also acknowledging the bad times right now. maybe ppl just expected the positivity minus the realism but that's something only trump would do
He took the cash and bought $35 calls.....
seriously everyone else just get off their bullshit stock and ride the GME train for the next month. you retards are trying to get everyone that made tons of money to yolo into something else when the squeeze hasn’t even started?!
i fucking hope so. can’t believe i diamond handed them this long only for it to moon on the fucking expiration date hahaha
Gme will never see $30 again
*Hello, and welcome to GameStop.*

That’s all you need.
I agree with your take on the spending bill which was a load of hot garbage. But, even if people do spend it on (unnecessary) goods, that still technically stimulates the economy and will keep the people who sell such goods in business.
Im 99.9% they keep this man in some kind of freezer all day. Dude was pale as fuck and walked off the stage like Robocop
That’s true but there could be a large sell off at open similar to what happened today
What channel? I missed it lul
  Cathie carrying PLTR so hard
Bb, then swing to pltr
I don't like change! the new uppy and downy arrows are annoying
Depends on the company. But I don’t think there’s ever been a short ratio like gme before. Definitely not one with that and WSB.
This is close to me... 180k debt. 470k house but had 90k for down-payment. 

Even with 500k salary, I feel trapped.
Cathie woods bought half a million shares of palantir today... PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I’m an extremely risk averse but this is what I’ve learned:

- Since 95% of my investments are in indexes the only way I lose all my money is if literally all the companies go bankrupt - at which point we’d probably be in an apocalypse and I plan on leaving with the first wave.

- I have enough “cash” on hand to maintain me for the next 6 months (long enough to pivot to a new career If need be) so I don’t need to tap into existing investments so I can focus on long term.

- since I’m not planning on retiring for another 15-20 years, I’m fairly confident that stocks will be worth a lot more at that point. Sure they’ll go down but they always go up.

- I resisted the urge to sell during this last recession when I lost 20% of my NW in order to become more resilient and it helped. Now I don’t care if my NW goes down 5-10k that week as it’ll likely go up within a year.

Tl;dr I’ve put enough barriers in place to protect me immediately in case anything “within reason” happens making it easier to focus 15-20 years on the future.

I should also add being employed helps a lot too with not being pessimistic.
Hell to the yes. Exercise if you can so the shorts can't buy your shares back!
Mommy Cathie is now going to see and love the PLTR holders one by one 🥰
Thank you for your service
Who makes the machines? Who ever can automate the most menial jobs is going to blow up.
Hahaha
You want to invest in companies with less cash flow? Whatever floats your boat.
It's easy when you have cash to buy the dip. Definitely way tougher if you're fully invested
Shoulda "invested" it all in GME anyways boomer
Florida state baby, got a good scholarship, thanks to that and mr. Saylor I’ll be living it up next semester
real talk boys, im 95%/5% in GME/MT portfolio started the year 2021 at 30k now at 75k

I know GME is memeing right now but i need to diversify. thinking of doing 70%/20%/10% GME/PLTR/MT respectively

Sound like decent diversification?
Yeah I saw this, made me think of this post.  I'm not happy about it but I'm still trying to determine who's the bigger scam artists: EOSE or Iceberg.  I've sent my info to Block & Leviton LLP and emailed EOSE as well for some answers.

Get the money and exercise them.
Inflation fears is gonna scare the shorts into covering 🚀🚀🚀
No, he thinks it'll reach $55

I mean people who bought silver/gold got through just as well. ?¿

I'd buy puts on Spokane with or without power outages.
Great investor

I’d wait until at least demo day, could see a run up. That’s just me though.

Well I don't know what the article says because I can't fucking read. What I do know is that it's all a bunch of baloney, written by a 🌈🐻 praying on our downfall. The only people getting crushed are Melvin Capital and your wife by her boyfriend. But who cares about them--you have yours and your fellow autists' gain porn instead.

$GME to infinity and beyond motherfuckers 🚀🚀🚀🚀
checked WSB, got scared of these bearish mood, then I checked GME and TLRY. Seems like nothing to worry about 🚀🚀🚀🚀
God speed.
Cinemas were always packed out any time I went. Get 50 quid out of every 2 people for food and tickets. If I want to watch a movie at home I will. If I want to go out I will. It’s not about the movie itself, I’d wait until it’s available if I don’t feel like going. I don’t think I’d pay to watch it at home if there is hundreds on Netflix, Disney and Prime I haven’t seen.
So is the GME situation just a technical squeeze, or is it also based on the company  reinventing themselves and being worth the new price?

Like, is it going to drop like a rock after the squeeze or will it still settle at a higher valuation post-squeeze?
Is it still time to buy when the market opens ? Or it would be a fomo to buy now

PLTR is that even a question???
I did Wednesday and made moneys, going all in on bb tomorrow
Since when is this considered “drilling”
I personally think that there's one more very important point to it.

Lots of people do what you describe with other aims, but I think that the most common denominator in this community is that the end goal is to buy time/freedom in some form or another, with early retirement being the most common but not the only way to leverage your savings to escape the rat race.
u/savevideo
> I was under the impression that the seller will not be assigned until the breakeven price is hit.

False. Nobody cares about the seller's breakeven, including the seller.

> Is the strike price the only thing worth considering? What happens if for example I'm selling a put at strike $18 with b/e $20 due to $2.00 premium and the stock is at $19 at expiry?

The only things that matter for gain/loss calculation is how much credit you received at open and how much you paid to close it. That's it.

As the seller, you have zero control over assignment. It could happen at any time. Usually, it only happens very near expiration, because exercising costs the buyer his extrinsic value and people don't like throwing money away.

There is absolutely nothing inevitable about it. Apart from the Wheel strategy, none of my short puts have ever been assigned, by intention. The simplest way to avoid assignment is *don't hold positions to expiration*.
Cathie probably doesn’t even give a shit about PLTR, she did it for us, for the WSB bagholders. She a real one!
Yeah that’s when the big infrastructure packages will come in
Happy cake day motha fucka!!

ATH 10 weeks ago was at 19. Two days ago, ATH was above 34. Seems like it has been mooning pretty hard and pulling back for a breather, nothing more. 

Anything specific behind your prediction? And do you have a price target or time frame in mind when you say $$$$?

Only the best darn vintage Joe Biden you'd ever hope for golly gee!
I’m driving 5hrs tomorrow during market open. If PLTR has a +10% day it will be the most entertaining drive of my life
I sold my cc 1/15 for 44C at 205$ today, and tomorrow will be interesting day.

I would think it will be "profit taking" vs "shorties covering the loss", but in either way I am ready to sell mine at 44$ if needed.
Lol nobody tell him.

Yeah my manz, short away, reverse mortgage your house than short some more.

Amazing! For the record, $9000 would probably be the market cap of the entire s&p 500, but hey I'm on board. Next stop tendie town!
i love cathie! F U citi and shitron
I concede, wish I bought calls. I’ll wipe my tears away with my GME tendies
You're right.. We should just keep it at 8.00 and hr because there's no point in raising wages while everything else gets more expensive anyway.. gtfo of here with that logic. And there are absolutely people who perform service jobs so you can sit around and bitch on the internet about low income workers from an INVESTING sub reddit. If anything.. trickle up economics will make businesses fly over the next couple years. Dow broke 30 when he came online and the pandemic fail has cost alot of those low wage earners a lot of income. I am certain they are excited to begin recuperating it in years to come
Biden? More like Sellen

Probably not but don’t be surprised if it dips for whatever reason. Weed stock in general is only going to go up until legalization/decriminalization. Just be aware that a lot of these companies are Canadian and will likely get boxed out by American companies. APHA has a decent foothold in America and they acquired Sweetwater brewing so not all just weed.
Because they're after your labor and happiness. That's the real cost of everything.
So it’s 1400 stimmy? (600+1400) or is it a brand new 2 bands?

Cathie the realest homie, in PLTR we trust
I also miss the good old days
Just don't sell because then it'll dip more.
Fuck yes I love this!!!!
So does the rule of never buy at open still apply here?
What about weed stocks today LOL?  I bought some APHA calls today but sold ofF TLRY.  I really should buy shares and hold..
Shitty Biden speech and mama Cathie bought some sweet PLTR

keep it going brotha. you will be back soon with a big play. my guess is shorting the top again like last year.

No sympathy for shorts whatsoever.  The stock went as low as 2.6 back in March. They could have closed then but got greedy and now they're paying the price.
Nothing moons until someone sells early. 

It's the cosmic trade that the market demands. 

This time it was a whale instead of one of us little fish.

Neat thanks

Don't like it? Then push back. Mock the scolds. Call them out.  


Otherwise downvote & block them. Either way don't let them win changing you or this place.

🚀🚀🔥🔥☄️☄️
Just say weed.
Damn it, you’re right.
Solid, RMO will bounce back at some point
Can we find out how much shorts lost on GME this week?
Not in the ARK ETFs but highly interested - how do you guys play it? You going shares only because IV/Premium is pretty high and liquidity dryer than a desert, right?
I love them and can't wait for their space exploration one.
Made stacks on GME today and looks like stacks on PLTR tomorrow. Damn good cake day 🤙
Higher minimum wage is more purchasing power to people who actually get the boost in minimum wage but remain hired. Supply and demand of labor is a function, with each $ increase in minimum wage resulting to an increase in involuntary unemployment. In all likelihood unemployment will increase but people remained hired earning  minimum wage will get an increase in purchasing power

I got excited when I learned about PLTR, but it makes some people’s brain hurt. This excites me, because she was spot on with TSLA
It’s been priced in
I was thinking more in the short term but yeah I can see that happening.
90% of my portfolio is going right into PLTR, the other 10 into ARKW baby. Let's fuckn go boys!! Lets make these old fucks at Citi homeless
Weird subtitle of "The Honorable Fuck Melvin"?!
Not debating that, my point is that it’s easy to say you’d be “happy to pay taxes on xxx income”, from my personal experience, I’m never happy paying taxes no matter the amount.
huh, ya broke him
ICLN up 1% AH!
If one of them has even slightly better gains than the others, that will swamp the expense ratio.
So is everybody else here so I dont who the youre ranting at but you sound like a baby back bitch
BB might go bankrupt, market might crash, etc. Lots of things could happen between now and 2023.
This is a lesson to all the 🌈🐻.  We will find you, and we will take all your tendies.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Depends on the state, some are $7.25 and some are $10.
LOOOOL yes at the time it felt like it would never end.

Good times
Lots of expats do it. Alot of people move to PR too
I am 52 this year and SS will certainly be there for us when we go to claim it. Both my wife and I have benefits coming that are material. However, I do not factor them into our calcs for RE. It'll just be a nice bonus when we choose to claim it.
Why
I mean... she did buy pltr 🤷‍♀️
That was sad, Biden can’t even pump his catheter bag
I came here literally just to comment this and ask if it's the first time this is happening
if you sell GME now, you'll be kicking yourself over the "Fuck You" money that could have been for the next 20 years.
I rolled my FEYE16C 3/19 profits into FEYE30C 3/19s and picked up PLTR40C 3/19s and 2022s.

Cathie just added 20k+ shares of PLTR today.

Was today the first time you heard about the stimulus check?
Its not for advice on what I should buy. Mostly thoughts and sentiment.
Yes
Yeah that will happen when you incite a deadly coup.
I meeeaaan, can’t we just say that those checks are already priced in?? We have more or less known they we’re gonna happen for weeks.
Well shit, haven’t been here a month.  Guess I just need more experience 🤡 Might still jump in tomorrow morning for some BB and GME FOMO mini gains.
Couldn’t Trump just pardon everyone who got arrested for storming the Capitol?

I went to an aquarium in Vancouver BC several years ago and one of the volunteers there was an old man who was just SO into little sea creatures. I didn't explicitly ask if he was retired, but you could just tell by the enthusiasm and energy he brought to telling us about coral and tiny fish, that he was doing something he absolutely loved. This is what I ultimately want.
Added 100 shares. Lets see

Are you on an extended payment plan? You can be making the payments you agreed to but still have the balance growing due to interest, sometimes called reverse amortization. Pull up a year of your student loan statements and examine carefully.
Mama cathie comes to bailout bagholders I love this market you literally get bailed out of every retarded decisions 🤣
True. There could also be a big pre-market pump like today. Regardless - keep nibbling on those dips.
If it’s confirmed now


Things should at least be pumped
I'm going to spend the rest of my life helping people by slicing them open and adding and/or removing things from their insides. As brutal as it's been and will be, it's been worth it.

Use this one. [https://www.calculator.net/interest-calculator.html](https://www.calculator.net/interest-calculator.html)

Yes there are lot of compound interest cal, but most of them do not have feature this one does which is to add your contribution in the beginning of the year, or the end of the year. Not only that, but this has monthly and annually contribution option. Some calculator only have either one, not both. This also have inflation % and tax % included.   


This one also have graph and pie chart. It's very clean, and not messy as the other one i seen.

S&P Global Ratings is an American credit rating agency and a division of S&P Global that publishes financial research and analysis on stocks, bonds, and commodities. S&P is considered the largest of the Big Three credit-rating agencies, which also include Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.  

Are you trying to tell people that a credit rating agency, a business, is not trying to make money? Or are you being a pedant, indicating that making money isn't a commonly used phrase for earning money?
Oh shiiiiit

Well, imagine thinking this stock is worth 10$ (lots of people still don't believe in the turnaround story). It's now at 40$ and you think it will go back down - doesn't it make sense to short it ? I mean, if you think this is the squeeze and it is as high as it'll get.
Congrats!
Good for PLTR, its fans are loyal so they should be rewarded with it reaching 30 by eod tomorrow.
  A possible acceleration in long term white collar labor cost reduction may happen or be happening because of what employers learned by having so many white collars jobs successfully performed remotely due to COVID-19. In the short term this is a big win for the remote worker.

Thesis:

When employers recognize that many of their jobs can be done and done well remotely, they will have the data to move them overseas to lower labor costs. A win win for companies, for remote workers, not so much.

Tell me this ain't so!
Same. Doing my part
NEVER bet against the meme stock
MMs waiting for all the 380-400c's to expire worthless at opex. Look at the OI on all the spx and spy options. People have been buying them up since last year and MMs are going to expire them worthless.
Im confident that jan 2022/23 calls on XOM or BP will still be 5-10 bagger. I loaded up on XOM leaps back in december and currently up 120%. BP leaps from the same time are currently up 80%.

Nope. He didn’t mention China not once.
BUY PLTR ASAP OF U CAN
There is like no volume for calls on this.
This was a test to see how market will perform by March 19. Looks like 17% up for now.
if the stock reaches $34 tomorrow you will definitely make a profit. you don’t need to exercise the option if you don’t want to buy the 100 shares. just sell the option and take your profits
While I was watching my GME and BB moon, my TLRY snuck up behind them and mooned too. This is bananas.

Exactly. Biden actually will do infrastructure week.... although Trump's constant pushing back of it definitely caused a lot of little opportunities to make a buck on the fake hype. I'll kinda miss that, but yeah, look for the tickers that have been around at least as long as Biden has. That's who is gonna benefit from a return to "normal".
> Are you sure that you must have earned income? I'm actually pretty curious about this because I couldn't find anything on the IRS site about the details other than the cap limits.

See [Pub 590](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a) for  definitions of "compensation" for IRA contributions

> I was under the impression that spouses without a job can contribute to a ROTH and certain funds like alimony would count

Yes, spouses not working but that make enough and are MFJ can contribute, also known as the "spousal" IRA (though not really an account called a spousal IRA) - and in Pub 509 it notes that alimony counts as compensation, but that dividend and interest income do not

>  I saw that it was possible to even treat non-tuition stipend payments for contributions.

This is a recent change, also noted in Pub 509:

"Certain taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipends. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2019, certain taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments are treated as compensation for the purpose of IRA contributions. Compensation will include any amount included in your gross income and paid to aid in your pursuit of graduate or postdoctoral study."
Ah ok, no worries.
This is not the way.

The fact you can't talk about micro caps is whack... So many random ones have run up like 100% the last few weeks... Super wild. Gme will have to suffice... Maybe a bunch of them will turn into billion dollar market cap in this environment.

That sounds right to me. Trailing stop losses can also be used to help reduce large unexpected swings. I will usually sit on my cash long term investment, but I always set trailing stops for margin just in case. I usually set mine at 10%, but many people will use 12% or 15%

I let Blackberry go by at $5 when I was looking for an out of favor leading tech company with a valuable brand and dedicated customers who love the product. I bought at over $9 because watching value double without me is my custom, every freaking time. Today it was all over wsb as it went up 20%. It shall be a meme stock now. Wonderful.

I didn't do much analysis at all, and never do math beyond a 5th grade level. I decided it was undervalued after looking at it's narrative potential. The chart does the job of a salesman. It peaked years ago above $130. It has looked cheap since then. They had an announcement about an agreement with Amazon a year ago that didn't get traction until recently. They are putting out a new phone. They are a security company now. They have a lot of tech in lots of places, one of which is every EV that isn't Tesla. Whatever, I know they have a powerful brand and I want my money back for the Classic that served me well for four years. They have great leadership. I'm Canadian. They're Canadian. We're Canadian. And that's why I bought Bombardier.
Yes
Buy PLTR it will be the next stock to go to $100
100%
Both: I WILL NEVER ASK FOR MORE FROM YOU
Maybe he'll just cancel student loan debt entirely haha.

I want you to sell GME and dump all into BB because I did, but you are prolly better off keeping what GME you have for the rest of the wheeze and new money into BB since it is just starting. Retard way of diversifying risk.

too expensive now. see how it trades tomorrow
Cathie bought $13 million PLTR on the dip meanwhile wsb paper hands were selling
I’ll be the fist one to admit I shorted GME yesterday when it was up 70%.   So far have lost half (good thing I only placed one put). 

As per your question the answer is; as long as all of you guys keep your calls and more importantly your shares the rally & squeeze will continue. However if people start to sell and it snowballs it will drop hard.  

I still think GME is a busted business but will also admit I was totally wrong and if there was a good way to lose money this would be it.  Love how everyone here fucked the big boys
That's cute. What's next? you gonna say the stonk market isn't a casino? lol gtfo

We’ve got to fill the want to trade, small trades do that. I wonder, what the average time is to each peridot target. If it took 200x longer to reach 200% vs , 1x target for 10x longer , would anyone go for the for the huge gain? Maybe this is why patience prevails.
Sorry to hear about the rough patch. How's the job hunt going?

I ain’t got shit yet.

Cathy Wood's bought huge amounts of shares with ARK!

All these beautiful gains feel like nothing after Deepfuckingvalue posts
Young Sheldon
It’s a mix of both. The fundamentals have changed because of the new board members, that likely triggered what’s happening now but what’s going on now is technical. It will drop and settle at a higher base than before imo (maybe around $30ish?)
Exactly. I’m unlearning. Sold 3500 at 25, (cost 17) because it jumped and I was on the road and was like it can’t go that high. 

Fucking wrong. I did that and I closed out my 100 x 1/15 30C for 7 cents...why? 🤷‍♂️ but goddamn if it isn’t beautiful what’s going on here.

I guess we just need to find another short stock and crush them 🐻
Does cathie wood have an onlyfans?
It's called politics.
She was too busy buying your 25c for pennies
There was plenty of insider selling.
Why did that SENS post get flagged as suspicious
Both. 

Lots of rumors were out that they were near bankruptcy, which drove all the shorting. Performance after the change in leadership made it clear that they're headed in the right direction and bankruptcy is off the table. Now shorters are shitting themselves.
I’m just worried there are American companies ready to take their market share.  Once it’s legal of course.
what the fuck why did we close with 100k shares of GME available at a smaller percentage fee?
That feeling when your OTM calls turn into ITM calls 6 months before expiry (Thanks APHA)
GME can definitely reach $60 within the next 5 months...
Um why is citi getting such a nice reward, could I be citi
Yeah, I agree with everything you said.  I never said they'll overtake Nvidia's market share anytime soon.  I'm just saying that if CNDA's improvement leaps continue at this pace they'll be able to compete in the same way that Epyc is competing with Xeon.  Although, you're right we have to wait and see.
what about it?

It’s much more than I expected, I figured he wouldn’t even mention clean energy. Big win tonight
He said all the WSB boyz and girlz we all gonna eat!!!
you really don't think blue wave won't raises taxes?
Scared money don't make money
She bought over 1mil shares at $15 as well
You get yours? Too the moon
Good point, I've been letting the fam down. I'm dropping $$ on shares tomorrow like it's 1980
Cathy has divided the sub, this is definitely a ploy to get us away from GME.
I really want to be excited for PLTR but I’ve been let down by it pretty frequently
Any recommendations on ToS tutorials? Its just so fucking professional looking
Hard to tell. It’s either gonna moon or Mars. $50 by demo day
APHA just broke ath
Is there a BB announcement tomorrow?
I hope so, 4/16 $34
Maybe its Bi-dip
democrats and taxes, name a more iconic duo
This is why their stock price is low, and I'm covering this in my DD video on Sunday. It's a gamble like any other penny stock, but I believe the positives outweigh the negatives on this one.

They had to completely shutter their operations and new patient intake during COVID, and they had to cut half their staff because their funding got pulled.

They only restarted in October.
Nice well when all the option vig is gone roll next week's into shares, unless you sell early... but don't sell early lol
There is potential that they are worth more than the lows that they were at but the prices rn are defiantly way more then that and even those prices would be speculative. Just like ever other company lol.
Did he talk about energy at all?
Will do man
Facebook should be paying Users, for the theft of their data.... I’m not a user of either for 5 years
I don't understand the appeal of Amazon. It's terrible for actually finding what you want.
What d I miss?
And probably $SRAC too
FS Associates is a student hege fund using paper money.
Need to know your managers ticket when you get a chance.
BB literally means 88. What don’t you get?
I think there’s still time! I’m not selling yet!
Dont downvote the position out of spite because I know all of yall are long GME. Upvote the quality content. Lol.
BB CALLS
You’re on the wrong side of history bud
I DEFINITELY think you should buy puts on GME
You spelled “week” wrong
Cathie Wood is like a richer version of Tina Fey
seems like you'd be happiest living feral in the woods then
I understand what *you* might think 1.9T will do to the value of my currency, I also understand modern monetary theory so I’m not entirely worried. Difficult to become insolvent running up debts in your own currency
Move to a real state , like Florida.
🚀?
I’ve been to Petco twice. It was scary as hell and my dog didn’t like it. For these reasons, I’m out.
Wow, 7 is goddamn low
If they’re 1/15, then yes, RIP.
It’s gonna go at least 1% up tomorrow
Thanks!
I'm pretty sure that's the closing time, not the opening time. The "0 DTE" includes options that were opened on expiration day, or the day before, and even 2 days before, IIRC.
Last few days - Correction resulting from company reinventing themselves and new management with RC and chewie gang. Still undervalued. Has okay fundamentals with good sales recently and next earning reports should be good. Add growing interest in the short squeeze through major outlets and the gap ups are even higher. Soon the squeeze will happen and we’ll see ungodly amount of returns. They’re going to have to invent a new shade of green to reflect our profits
yield curve rising and M2 going down.  On top of that tomorrow is monthly opex.  Excited to see what next week is going to look like
because they should be a 100 billion dollar company but analysts who want to get in cheaper try to manipulate retail to sell
Yeah but even Trump seemed more genuine.
Wait, what is he losing by only trading on RH?
Scroll down for literally one second. Jesus, is this the amount of effort you put into researching your positions?
No.
I was wondering why PLTR was up 5% after hours.
Is this why it moved a crap ton after hours?
Exactly, the Hurst exponent will show you if a time series is moving in a trend, mean reverting or moving according to brownian motion.
i understand that
$BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🍆💦
$PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
you should sell your rolex and buy pltr calls then
What about it?

BBBY too
What if u/deepfuckingvalue _is_ Michael Burry...😦🤯
Kamala will mention weed. Letting you all know rn . Thx auntie
Nah Marvel, Star Wars, etc. are big events. Don’t see that going away. Who wants to watch a new MCU movie in their mom’s basement on premiere night?
So fucking triggered I had 500 bucks in PLTR FDs that I bought yesterday and sold today for half. ReEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I bought and sold 8.5c today

Made money

But whoops
7% is the market average, that shouldn’t be what one strives for. Cause then why the hell arnt they just investing in VTI?

The real aim for investors is between 10-15% per year for over 10 years. If you can do that, you’ll be rich. But few can because it’s incredibly difficult.
Futures wouldve exploded if mango presented this same stimulus
PLTR is pumping after hours, bought 200 more today to bring me to a measly 600 shares but I am excited for market open. I really need AMD to pull through the next 2 weeks as I have 75 spreads open at $91/90 currently that I have been slowly buying/selling as price jumps.
Chickened out. Glad I did. It was up 22% at open, dropped to 6.5% (where I would have paper handed the shit out of that) before it went back up.
When you buy an options call and then sell to close that position say at a profit instead of exorcizing the right to buy the shares, who buys that?  I sell it but who buys it, someone else buys the remainder of that contract?
Vito arc
Roughly when you do expect that bill? I’ve got a lot of clean energy calls for 2/19

🚀
Idk what happened w pltr but I have a 26c and 130 shares looking to fly tomorrow. Also sold a 26.5cc but I can close it after closing the 26c
NGA baby
So first we fucked Melvin, and now we are going to shoot for the biggest of the biggest; Citi.

We really are the captains.
No
It won't happen unless you believe!
Markets tanking
Speech was amazing. President Buyden sounded like he was putting a thick blanket of tendies on me.
Yes
Thanks Autist gang was in $GME 40 calls and flipped them for 100% in 20 min.
1001 shares of PLTR
about damn time!
Paper handed gme and fomoed back in after hours at all time high
Naming our first born after Plant ear. Do not question the plant ear
You are stupid, but probably more confused than stupid.

LEAPs work just like any other option, they're just a year+ out.

The nice thing about them is they derive a large part of their value from time, so they stay worth a lot of money even if price goes against you.

they have a strike price just like any other option and if the strike price is below current price, you are ITM on a call and OTM on a put. Just like any other option.
Yes
Haha F them 😂💎💎💎🙏🏾
Theme of the week: Reverse Citi and make money.
Made more gains today in after hours than in normal trading hours lol
IVV, QQQ, DIA are some examples. They follow SP500, Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones
Cathy
Previous one gave away billions (or tax breaks) to corporations.  How much is it this time?
To be fair, them buying it no matter how large the position will create a positive sentiment
really need spy to have a +1% day tomorrow... :(
Not since the Crips and Bloods marched peacefully together in the first gang truce for 27 years have two gangs been so beautifully united as GME & PLTR
Only if you invest enough than she emails you a link
He gave birth to the GME
Bought riot shares at 29. Crap
Imagine not knowing what WSB is and you see this stupid brick and mortar dying video game company rising and you think to yourself “wow this is a GREAT time to short!” 

And a subreddit full of literal autistic retards makes you lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. What a fucking life
LOL
I’m balls deep in BB AS WELL
Big if true
BB gang where you at? 🚀🚀🚀 we rocket tomorrow, balls to the wall!
I knew I should have used more 💎🍆💦  and 🚀🚀🚀as camouflage!
Futes are fake and gay. SPY +1% by open
Probably get some wild swings tomorrow
Holding $BB baby

Nobody talking about Tasha Keeney?
the amount of buying AH on BB... crazy

PLTR at 30 will be magical
I did but I was 2 months early :(

I've been nutting all day to GME and now this? This is better than rolling on ecstacy at a skrillex concert. 🚀 thank you wsb
look at that carp cock!!!! PLTR 2/5 30C
If a stock doesn’t have options, what milestones does it need to hit to acquire them?
ARKW bought 497,200 shares today based on their trading desk info
Get 2023 GE Leaps. Thank me later.  Any strike.
I appreciate the compliment but I'd rather check my phone 100 times a day for nominal gains
already in
lets go
smart move. learn what you like. do research. and dont burn thru on your first go around.  50%play 50% save if your mid to long.

Citi and Melvin are no match for us

Don't fit gotta.... 🤷‍♂️
He did. I didn't catch the speech but saw it on twitter
Yssss clean energy
Not really. Everything we already knew. No mention of Green energy or infrastructure as thatll be in round 2
I have some Fitbit stocks it says it is untradable now that they are merging with google what’s that mean for the money I have in Fitbit stocks?
That helps a little. That’s 9% keep going, what else you got
$15 EOD
Selling all my ICLN at open. This party is over folks
694.20 bro. come on.
My dick can only get so hard. Please god yes. I’ll exercise mine
Theses guy said it well you gotta sell before everyone else because that’s when it’s going to drop sell half now or more save a lil in their what ever you want or at least pull out what you put in so your not at a lost if you choose to stay
If he cared ya
F
It’s a valid concern and one I have too, but I think regardless there would be a big pump for all marijuana companies at legalization so could dump then. I have a good but in MSOS for the reason you mention.
Bb calls?
Thanks I love you too
Hey it’s your personal risk tolerance
Which ark?
Airlines banning racist Karens and Kens is fuckin bullish!
This did not age well.
If you don’t get exercised, I believe you can buy it back up until 4pm of the day it expires.
I like anything below $20 out at least a year
No it’s to make room on the board
Usually with M&Ms and crayons.
Can you imagine being in WSB are not being part of GME gang? I can’t.. I feel stupid for only having 300 shares
Yeah, this probably belongs in r/tax.

Opening an IRA has no tax consequence. The tax stuff comes into play when you make contributions or withdrawals.
Made more in GME this week than 3 months salary I fucking love this place
I got both today, moon mission confirmed for both
It’s a etf my man
Yes for sure, imma see if it dips below 40 in the am, then if not I'll buy before it hits 44/45. That's the plan anyways
why are you buying weeklies like an idiot?
Leaps and shares
Too late to get into $GME or $BB?
Cathie buys. Cathie discloses. Stock goes up. Cathie benefits.
Oh really?  I don’t remember that!

 Not to brag or anything, but my cost basis is still lower than hers 🤪
That's me.
Sweet good talk
I've been riding XOM like a horse. Bought a bunch shares at 41 dropped down to 33 or 31, shit made no sense tripled up my postion. Been amazing and I think this thing has legs. If DASH is worth 63 billion and BP is worth 86 billion... Thanks for the BP tip
Nope.
That's more DD than the average subscriber
No love for paper handed mofos
good call
I’ll be on hwy 80E. If PLTR gets over $27 you’ll see a black Tesla smashed into a median guarded and me with a smile ear to ear showing the cops my  sweet tendies!
just buy shares, most of the money ive made is through shares
there was that democrat guy who said no way
Cathie bought a fuckton of PLTR today
Not going to be flat.  It will head up.  Stimmy, rejoining the world economy, and clean energy will lift the markets.  Corps don't care about slightly higher taxes if they are selling twice as much product.  Team Trickle Up inbound!
most memes stocks up AH no one cars about spy
Fucking legend
We going to $15? Please!?
She bought big at the end of the year. Did she buy again recently?
About three fiddy
Sounds like Melvin
Grabbed 500 after hours. 🚀
ARK should basically be your bank account, dont keep your money in a bank when Cathie can hold it for you
Trump should hold a conference right now and say, "He's full of shit" just as a final troll
Isn't new york opening back up even with high numbers?
Just you wait ... 😏🚀
Nice one!
Do I hold these unannounced SPACs for more? Or do I sell them and take the 15% gains?
This was the epic short.squeeze
I agree to your analysis
GME not loved by wall street but look where it is now.
🔪🔪🔪
Same
You guys buying shares, calls, or both?
I am very partial to accessible and affordable higher education  for everyone, so seeing your case just really makes me happy. 

So a surgeon. Be a good one and grats again.
I want to say EY has a department of agro-sciences. They have some really interesting things published if you care to look. Basically DE is a primary benefactor, then and cargill
Im not saying it doesn't, just that the company's and the P/E they can trade at are not comparable.
Always 🚀🚀🚀
Why
lol nah the meme has plenty of runway
You realize shares don't expire right?
we got the money printer on our side
I got the hunch he’s going to get rid of federal tax exemptions for the big players. That, raising minimum wage, direct investment into Main St, and stimmy cash.
I’m getting pretty good at this pltr thing buy around 24/25 sell at 27 rinse and repeat

He said clean energy during his remarks, so yes.
I love the idea of investing in space.  But this company has been making promises for over a decade that they can get off the ground.  Shits gonna blow up with Branson on board lol.
Then why did you cheat?
$PLTR to $1000, they found Osama bin laden for God sake. Probably saved the Empire State Building and another few airliners. PLTR doing GOD's WORK!

I just sell atms and wheel them through my account. Sold x18 25Ps today for 0.60 each. If I get assigned ill sell 25Cs next week, unless i close my positions to fomo back into GME.
I’m all in on GME, but F is on my watchlist. Seeing those reservations just confirmed my interest
If Sleepy Joe didn't talk about tech and how they pay 0% taxes , we would be flying.
Oh plz aunty

GME AND CCIV TOMORROW 📈
Why is BB and BBBY rising? Lol. Are we back in 2006?

Sure fire, lolz.

I was really hoping Biden was gonna say all future vaccines would be distributed via your local GameStop and that a $25 min purchase needed to be made in order to get it.
Yep. And the movie ends with him making a shit ton of money. But a lot of those guys you see, all the banks and the assholes, a lot of them made money in the end too. Sure a lot of them fucked up and lost everything but most of it was thrust onto the middle and lower class.
Cathie bought a ton today
Everything red afterhours
You just got this off another post...way go be original 😒
I thought Tilray was a scam?
like Fuse?
I see a lot saying this will equal a good open for ICLN and PLTR. Is there no love for BLDP?

I barely started a month ago, first time trader, I’m up nearly 300%, I acknowledge it’s rare but I also have only had 1 losing trade out of about 10 so far.
I’m back!
That would be fantastic haha
Just got my W2 between taxes and SS, etc. almost 50%. How is SS still a thing? Give me 7.5% and 7.5% from my employer and let me put in 401k. So much richer

Yeah of course they always raise taxes but skeptical on them effectively closing loopholes, not the sharpest tools in the shed
400 unemployment until almost eoy was not priced in
It made Trump supporters feel good
I’d be happiest with a 10% flat tax across the board. Rid of the rest of it.
GME is definitely a spirit bomb kind of story. WSB sending Cohen our power!
Those are my rocks. Selling way otm calls on them. Don’t be greedy collecting premiums. These things can fly and bite you in the ass. However with tsla being speculated to correct it’s a nice little hedge.
What, do you hate money?
You can’t compare GameStop with PLTR. Completely different businesses in different life cycles of a company. The only similarity they have is they’re meme stonks.

PLTR literally cannot shit the bed. There’s not much action because of 🌈🐻
We’ve waited. We watched GME gang have their moment and now finally we rise too
Anyone know why PLTR pumping AH? Catalyst or just for funzies?
Cathie is just too sexy
Topgolf was a hot acquisition. Extremely innovative company with great cash flow and strong growth opportunities.
There is a provision regarding "in the instance impeachment" it would end up in court.

What happened to BB today? Need some quick highlights- thanks in advance :)
 Short it. Thank you in advance for your sacrifice ❤️

Are you asking how to actually set SL and TP on MT4?  Or are you asking how to calculate where the TP would go after you set your SL?
Change of an era lad, infrastructure & job economic package to address climate change incoming in the very near future, I’d argue first few weeks of his presidency
I had heard to keep an eye put for it but didnt realize it was today until i hot an alert. Hoping before the weekend we sea a wave
Robinhood stopped my depositing and I only got 5..
That’s the thing, these people are stuck living paycheck to paycheck. Tons of reasons leading to it being a cycle. “Average“ people don’t realize how hard or expensive it is being poor. Or that more consumers with expendable cash will be good for the market.
She kept buying BABA since it dropped from 290 so dont take it as a "2000$ EOD" advice
Plus liberals love high gas prices, shit was retarded under obama.
Can’t wait to unload my tesla tomorrow and grab half BB calls and rest shares ❤️❤️
You also in with a 1mil shares ;)?
YES short GME tomorrow!
There has been an insane amount of bullish news for oil lately the market has barely even begun to price in. Like enough to start another oil supercycle. XOM/BP are still trading at half of what they will probably will be in a year. Leaps on them is going to net insane returns, especially if oil experiences a demand squeeze from production cutbacks and post-covid euphoric demand.
RH tryna tempt me. They increased my instant deposit to $25K. Joke’s on them, I ain’t got shit left to transfer

Can you elaborate? Whisper that sweet sweet DD in my ear plz
I know bro i had high hopes. Gonna give it the rest of the month for more clean energy plans to come out
Intel can’t get past 12nm reliably with their fabs, TSMC are stepping up tooling up for 5mn. The only way forward for Intel is to outsource to TSMC or Samsung - But are fabs stretches to capacity even going to want a short term customer over loyal ones? There’s some new rumours that TSMC will create i3’s for intel, however I find that hard to believe. Intel need to do something, but they won’t catch up for at least a few years. AMD is set until 2024.
... Is this where I say something something casino?
Haha nice I grabbed 300 shares at $10.07
Omg she is
You're going to blow it all on options and you're kids are gonna live in poverty regardless, it doesn't matter.

More seriously though, there'll be a huge correction and HQs might move abroad.
IF I DONT SEE A 10% RAISE IN MY PORTFOLIO TMRW FUCK!!!!
im not THAT retarded
If your stocks drop 10%, your portfolio drops 20% and high yield stocks tend to drop a lot when there is volatility in the market. Also QYLD is one of the worst stocks you could own on margin.
Agh! I fell asleep and missed the GME train 😞
Do you have videos on how to learn options? I have been wanting to learn how to do them. I was going to put 40 dollar calls for this Friday for GME last week but wasnt sure what I was doing and i bet id be up like 1000% or whatever
Those earnings are being played tomorrow morning.  Whatever they do on their earnings day will be secondary

I am fucking ready to die on this $BB cross.
I am a bit worried about my shares and 135 Feb 17 calls, because it seems that Apple is performing like a typical boomer stock. All the reports point to historic earnings, but the stock is barely holding ground. I am a bit worried that it will fall more pre earnings, cuz all the boomer analysts are saying that new stimulus will make investors switch from tech to industrials, which does not make any sense actually. People will buy f.king Iphones with their checks, not plane tickets.
Where is Catherine pltr share news, I cannot find anything.
I have PLTR 30 and SpCe 30 calls expiring tomorrow. Never thought this would happen.
Fuck me. I misspelled her name. True retard here.
Yes but I think it's foolish to assume that the USD will be the reserve currency forever.

Some countries have started paying back their debts significantly...
This guy must have a fucking diamond cock
Nah i had july calls just dumped em to free up capital and making money is better imo

Whats the reason GME is going to moon tomorrow?
this is actually fucked

didn't the reason why we told britain to fuck off 300 years ago was cuz we were being taxed like this?
BAN this filth
Yes I will squeeze beyond your meat bbby
This is SO crazy as I have been tracking all of ARK buys and sells for the last 2 months, and whatever they buy, the security goes up within the next day. 

I have seen this with so many, to name a few are TDOC, EDIT, CRISPR, ZM, and now PLTR today, Cahtie Woods is a freakin' wizard!
SELL PLTR (Confusing the algorithms)
Make your plays and post your gains. That'll bring in attention.
Buy 9,000 @ .94, sell 5,000 @ 1.81...4,000 shares for free ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)

Good question, I have been a Buffett fan for decades. I live in Nebraska and go to the shareholders meeting every year. I still believe that there is plenty of growth there. Every time one of my stocks have a big win and I sell them I either buy brk or an index fund with the proceeds. It’s about 50/50 for me. So I certainly do buy index funds and I would say your logic is solid.
Citi downgrades PLTR to $15

Cathie said hold my beer
You could say the same about GME 🤷‍♂️
Still haven’t gotten it yet. Prob for the best
I missed that. Sounds like the USD is gonna tank
Seems like PLTR is gonna happen.
I'm confident the Spy dip will be bought by open, BIGLY

Just roll them out bro
IMAGINE NOT HAVING FAITH IN CATHIE TO TAKE PLTR TO URANUS.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Oof I don't know about that but I appreciate the mega compliment!
i have apha stocks and calls and the other two... same with BB but with 10 8.5c 1/22 instead... hoping for 20 so i can ring that register.
Cathie Wood / ARKW just bought 497,100 shares today.
> Is the profit on each of the 4 purchases tracked with that individual purchase or would I have to wait to take any profits until August 1?

It's tracked with the set of shares you bought on each date, so at this moment you could sell the set of shares you bought on Jan 1 and only pay LTCG on the earnings - you'd have to wait until it's been at least one year from the other sell dates to sell those sets of shares pay LTCG rather than STCG
our lord and savior cathy
If this is a homework question, then it should be easy for me to find information about this topic in a textbook or other course material. Could you point me to that material please? I'm happy do figure this out myself, but I already tried googling it and I can't find any examples of compound interest where there is a fee attached or where the compounding doesn't happen automatically. Thanks!
Yeah I'm not overweight so that's not it. But predisposition makes sense. Much of my family have intestinal problems.
Does Burry still own all those shares of GME?
Cathy Wood bought 500k shares AH
It will be when the short squeeze peaks... which might not be until April earnings... WHO KNOWS...
he's banned from Earth, remember?
God being banned today was hard. 
I wanted to say so many things about my GME gains lol
Just a matter of time he starts saying autism’s and retards on the show

I’ve never heard this in my life. If I were to want to buy bed sheets (to stay on topic), within 5 mins, I could find probably 50 bed sheets vs having to go to a store.

I punched my boss in the face. Dumb bitch im rich
Well Melvin and Citi aren’t doing it

Lol, uh... not quite that many :)
Pltr is the chosen one.
That makes sense. Are there any rumors of moves in that direction?
Not a 🌈🐻 but it feels like everything is in a fucking bubble that’s about to pop. Goddamn 19yo tiktok stars are boasting about their TSLA gains to their zoomer audiences who are all in the comments like “oh yeah I just bought some shares with my daddy’s credit card LOL”
Go HAM brother, that moon money waits
Dude Uber said "Yikes!" That's all the confirmation bias we need!
S&P had a good year for obvious reasons. Better than normal; curious what will happen with the market overall this year, if anything abnormal really.
I only have 200 and feel like a fucking genius.
Yes!
Where do you see this?

No, these are good tips, thank you.

BBBY short squeeze according to Jim Creamer

Nothing is too big to fall. History is littered with similar examples.

[Following up on my job hunting from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kwdh85/daily_fi_discussion_thread_wednesday_january_13/gj6ic4g/?context=3):   

Today's update was basically nothing new. New ETA for the manager role is next week. There is a high level technical role, equivalent to director, that I'm also being considered for. The VP wants "to bring me back" so he's figurig out how best to do so. Supposedly. I'm not holding my breath and I'm still looking. I'll take a look at the specific technical title they are think and see if I can apply to something similar elsewhere as well.

The good news is there's another opening that I may be able to get a friend to fill who is perfect for the job and desperate for a job. He needs to get the 2 years work experience and it largely doesn't matter where.
Unconfirmed cold sore; possible old man sore. I’ll check with our laboratory techs about his HSV-1 results. I will not miss the mango-glow.

DD is impossible when a totalitarian state permits cooking the books and manipulates their currency for national pride. You have absolutely no way of knowing if any of the numbers for any Chinese firm are real so it's blind gambling. NIO and BABA are the next Luck*n.
This is what MartyMoho could have been.
Where did you see this?
its called pumping.
You took profits, and you missed a lot of gain that’s true. You paper handed but it was a safe bet. But it’s not to late to use those gains to buy more shares, it’ll only go up. Literally can’t go tits up.
Agreed. Should have just focused on clean energy and checks.
CHWY, NET, ROBO, GEVO
How new are
550k added to ARK
Another thing to keep in mind is the merger with Tilray. Your shares will be converted to Tilray shares, you will get 0.83 shares of Tilray for each APHA share you own. Tilray is currently way up also, trading at around $20. APHA is hovering around 12.50-13. I am not a mathematician but it looks to me like APHA is still a bargain, considering 20 x 0.83 = 16.60

I have 300 shares of APHA and I am definitely NOT selling. Good luck with whatever you choose to do!
Cathie bought more TDOC too, she’s obsessed with that stock
I’ve been waiting for this day. We had the pop on the Amazon news and then a lull. Hopefully money starts flowing into now. I actually like the company too!
Anybody that shorts anything should be prepared to take a bath.
Why? You can get in on skynet before it vaporizes us
pltr on a mission after hours
Fuck you
Checking futures after reading this sub reminds me of my friends bitching about their nfl team losing then I check the score and they’re down 10-7 in the third quarter.
Calls
It’s mind boggling but I realized that the market goes up when ppl are doubtful bc puts are converted into more upward momentum when they expire worthless as market is flat or creeps up. 

Same goes for when the market is max bullish, and volatility is forcefully pushed down. But, when the market can’t suppress volatility and stocks are losing liquidity to bonds, then a forceful reversal may happen on equities if people are hedging, taking profits, and moving to safe havens
I sold 1/15 147 Arkk. Am i fucked ? 🥺
🤣
If it hits 50 I sell, that’s more than double profit and im not waiting for the pump to die down
I sold my 1/15 20 calls for a loss last week. I feel stupid.
Imagine buying an ETF and expecting meme price action
\>people trying to frontrun Cathie on her own ETF
WE FUCKING ARE TUE MARKET NOW 🌝🌚🌝🌚🌝🌚😘🌚😘
Uhh PLTR 30 won't print
GME and PLTR, the pillars of WSB
Probably a couple hundred and because I thought it would take a dip at close but nope
You get that and I’ll get a sticker for my laptop
You had all of the past year to get on that train.
Came here to say basically this.   Cramer is gonna make BBBY into GME part 2.   Also gonna flip some tricks with brokerage staff to beg to get in on coinbase IPO
We are pumping Green, Black and Brown Economy.  Would have liked more discussion about concrete and steel...
This mans a fucking time traveler and no one can convince me otherwise
I think the catalyst for that was the post itself. Within the first hour after that Reddit post the stock rose over 25%, without any other reason. It's probably gonna dump hard.
Mostly even across all of these:

MTDR, CCL, LADR, GEVO, FuelCell En, POWW, WOOF

Wondering where I should go for best growth
He was good at pumping
Remember when Dems were screeching for 4 years about rigged elections after shitting on the sidewalk outside the nyse
Though you may think it’s not much in dollars, 30% in 2 months is pretty impressive. Keep up the good work
JPM?
I've only got $20 worth that I didn't buy till today. Just got back from a "no screen" week. 😭
I wish I yolo'd my 10K with him. I'd be sitting with a cool 1M in the portfolio....
Except GME, 6% already whats good
This comment gave me some actual hope. Real, actual hope. Thank you.
Bought a LEAP just today
Jim Cramer quickly becoming my favorite tv personality. Watch your back guy fieri
My God..... Imagine a short squeeze on AMC.....
Just saw this too, pretty cool.

What's a good play on this? 

SPY Call at the Open?
more like retard of wall street
Just remember the short term tax rate vs long term. My advice stay in the market until you die.
Sold my wife's wedding ring to buy more BLACKBERRY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
yep. 250c 4/16
Man I feel like ass. I literally sat in my house all day and smoked weed and looked at my phone screen most the time. Jerked off and ate food. Literally a shit stain but $6k unrealized gains. Still feel like ass. Maybe might go for a run around the hood like a hipster
Because we said so

Where the tendies OP?
Oh I didn't understand that's what OP was talking about. Thought they were talking about selling through redfin
And a -5% dip tomorrow at close yay
Great song tho
What's in the menu for tomorrow?  I'm thinking GME short margin calls at open.  🍽
Cramer said we are incredible to watch!!!!!
6.6bil annual rev 2019. They’ll be positive FCF next ER and moving forward. Without the potential squeeze GME is worth over $100/share. Cohen will take us there, but the MOASS might be our express
sold PLTR YOLO +$12K
sold TSLA YOLO +$4K
re-entered PLTR YOLO late today
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
What is this PLTR AH action for?
Joe Bearden

Joe Bidump
Exactly, and if businesses have trouble they can always subsidize it. Just like how Tesla is thriving. Policies helping the lower class are very necessary to the health of the economy. You can always offer incentive to big business but if you do it without securing results it doesn't make sense.
nop, pump n dump
Shit. I meant calls for Tuesday. I didn't work today so that threw me off. Plus I've been putting in ot. Last week was like 90 hours
Did you earn the money from an employer/job showing earned income? You could open a Roth IRA with a parent as the person to act and when you get to be of age you take it over
just Cathie
Did she buy today? Where can I find this info?
500k shares bought for ARKW
Aapl, premiums sunk today
hi its me the SEC
Naw house will pass it blindly. They will use nuclear option and pass it in the senate. It goes through. It’s just been priced in.
It will be 100 eoy chill
Bears forgot about Biden’s speech now their puts are shakin, better learn some timing
That would've be hysterical hahaha
4/16 19c 4/16 30c and 1/29 50c
Why? Was it dropped in water?
How can I leave what any of this means? Like he "held onto Jan 15 calls right before they expired"

I don't understand any words in that..


Also why did be? Just sheer chance? Did he throw tons of money into it by hope? Not to sound like an actual retard (not in the flattering way) did he likely have inside knowledge?

How can I understand these words more? Googling isn't helping when I don't know what I'm looking for.

So a week or less before he would have been busted, out of nowhere the market shot up on GME? Does u/D do this with multiple stocks and this is the one that just made it and is noteworthy?
Bullish 🚀🚀🚀🚀🦅🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Well, at least it isn’t $600 again, that was fucking ridiculous.
Great call, bought with an average of 0.7014 and its up 1.11 after hours right now

Paper handing it and taking my profits in the AM so thank you!
Didn't even mention ONE of his buddies companies and the cool new thing they make. Bullshit!
Lmao imagine being a pajama trader and being scared of an old man on the TV 🤡🤡🤡
Biden is going to be the death of the market for the next 4 years!
Not our problem
They already sold at around 31, its already been gobbled up. The reason they sold is a firm they work for has a rule about owning too much so he was forced to sell. it wasn't a gamestop problem.
have faith my son 🚀  🚀
At least i still have 3 $26 calls to laugh at my fucking face tomorrow
Cathie buy I buy it’s that simple
Could only buy 10 shares. Percent gains on percent gained will get you to the moon, the ride is just a big longer from farther away. $300 to $1400 (mistakes were made) in 2020. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Whatever works for ya
CRAMER FINALLY DID IT!!!!!!! 

 
is this the top?
Never said that's what people should aim for as a goal, but it should definitely be your lowest point early on. As you say, why bother trying if you're not atleast matching the market.
Someone gimme a movie to watch
💎💎💎⚽️⚾️🏐🏈
Can you tell me 3 days before it’s gonna pump because I’m not tryna lock up money for 2 years
Yes I understand that but it wastes my time having to check 🦍
8.5 here just started trading and about to make my first hundo.
It’s because the green market is supposed to take off under Biden especially since the market has been heading that way the past 4 years even under an “unfriendly” administration towards green energy. With the market doing its own thing but now being bolstered by a new administration it should have good returns for as long as Democrats keep good on their word.
Look at PLTR after hours
Tesla went up a bit AH😩 please fly tomorrow
11 by next week ez
Yessirr
Because when people buy stocks they moon
It's based on the date you bought the shares, so you'd owe STCG on the earnings of shares you bought within the previous 12 months, and LTCG on the earnings of the rests of the shares
Burger king man does not approve
She bought much, much more than I did
hope so
thanks it’s this thing called luck and a little autism
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yep, I'm a fucking moron
My first experience with Cramer was my economics teacher trying to be cool showing us the vidya of stewart reaming him out

Now I sit around each night, no cable of course, hoping to hear Cramer pumped up the stonks in my portfolio.

IDC what they say I love you Cramer
How big is bidens stimulus package?
I haven’t actually loled in a awhile, this is actually good. I’m shocked you composed this thing
Why the fuck is spy dumping... you limp dick pile of shit! He said 1.9 TRILLION!
Why bb ?
For how long?
Also, there was a landslide in Brazil about a month ago, thats where VALE is, and it hit mines or something, making supply lower and prices higher🤑
40 1/29 $130 Apple and 12 1/15 $860C TSLA... 

I could be ok but I just have a horrible feeling after Bearden said the corporate 'T' word... and how the market reacted over all today plus futures and the shit AH movement
He’s at 15,540
Icln pleas fly
Is that a joke or serious?
Get that naysayer out of here! To the GULAG!
I sold all of my positions today to free up $75k. If that shit even thinks about going down I will be buying every single share I can get my hands on.
That combined with Obiden given out government money for Green New Deal.

Did u sell????
I officially upgrade PLTR to 75. Please make this to front page
Doubt that’ll ever happen. And guess what, interest starts back up next month!!!
I would typically say the same.. but this. This is something else.
i don’t understand.. why is pltr going up AH after citi fucked it?
Cathie Wood added PLTR to ARKW.
What did Joe say about PLTR?
In four fking hours, you got some hours under the belt doing this shit dude. Props

It’s PLTR man. It’ll end flat. Until March then 🚀🚀
If blackberry made a new phone with the full button keyboard I would easily buy it again. As long as I can play stardew valley I'm good.
Cramer spends all day refreshing WSB, it’s pretty obvious
He's gotta be slick with it. Like "we're not out of the weeds yet 😉"
Did what
Good for you I do the same except lose money instead 👍
no money left bro . I am poor :(
BB is our meme stock, it’s tsla nio and gme all over again
Well im holding stocks at leverage on etoro. Hopefully this helps.
That would be neat but it could be because of Cathie buying half a million shares

I’ll have to look into this further and see how it differs from tech that’s already on the market. What you described has been out for years. Still, their value skyrocketed today so congrats!
PLTR short squeezeeeee!
We’re they in to begin with. I actually sat down the other night and looked at the top 20 in each and did not see this come up. Recently started getting the daily emails with the buys and sell too.

Cathie bought half a mil of shares today
The number of posts I saw today on here asking what a put/call is and the general confusion about tendies makes me think we got a ton of foot traffic.
Get this political bullshit out of here retard
Can’t ever be too sure on this sub. Next few weeks could be different.
If it goes that high you’ll be in the clear most likely, but in the future 25% in a day is a pretty big ask
Just it will go with my baba yolo
Thank you sir
looks like a bear, smell like a bear, act like a bear, wondering what it could be
The market is so 50:50 right now.  One has to watch closely and be ready to move.  I'm not worried about inflation though.  The economy is not going to be good enough for a long time to put the inflation pressures into play.

So Cathie must’ve heard it!?!
I'm more of a dodge man.....
Because I'm a retard and have no idea how calls work lol. But RH says that the 15c rose 653% today but the 11c only rose 362%. Wouldn't that make 15c more profitable or am I just dumb
:0
If it hit hits 13 I'll subscribe with all my extra money
You got the main actor right, but the main idea wrong.
Burry is with us. Wrong side of history in the making, friend.
Tommorow some puts expire so 🐻🏳️‍🌈 have to cover
He said buy the dip
the first gme post I saw was an argument that if the sub bought enough shares we could get voting rights and make a rule that our dividend payment is a game boy. Or something like that. I thought it was a joke, I didn’t realize this sub was actually going to make liftoff
What's the next meme stock?
My 401k is heavily in ARKG/W
Lucky Number Slevin
EDV, anti-correlated to equities
Ahhhh, ark investors news eh?
y’all too worried about ICLN like bro when was the last time UCLN’d your room ?
PIPP is now 50% above NAV. Would not recommend buying at these levels. Too many people are FOMOing into SPACs that are 40-60% above NAV with no target in sight.

Instead take a gander as GSAH or DMYI.

If DMYI follows the timeline of DMYT (now RSI) or DMYD (picks and shovels of sports betting), we may potentially see a merger announcement in the next few weeks. The DMY team moves fast.

I bought DMYI warrants today. GNRS warrants are still under $2 as well.
BB projection?
I know, I was just saying I calculate like this with my shares. I just did this two days back
 Taxes are for smooth brains. We just sell IOUs with 0%. And if we can't sell enough, we just buy them ourselves. How does that work? No one fucking knows.
Webull comment section is 90% people thinking exactly like you said.
Yes
icln broke my heart this month 💔
50%+? I think you're missing a zero. It should say 500%+
Ooof - good luck :(

I hope they do pay off for you - I've got some Feb 30c calls myself, so a pop would do us both good!
I'm in 300 shares at 10.07 and gonna have to buy my calls tomorrow at open.

Cathie Wood bought in.
And once again , it's like I'm scared to make money. I had 4 PLTR calls that I sold for absolutely no fucking reason today. Feb 22 expiry I believe it was

Cathie bae
Ahh the good ole days. When Antifa was just a bunch of peaceful grungy stoners protesting evil capitalism
I just read your comment history for the past iunno, 14 days or so. You've had 2 other comments about GME. Both were "glad gme idiots got washed out." Etc. We've all doubled our portfolios on shares alone, calls are exponentially higher returns. Gl on your 23% gains yoy Melvin.
simp.
Fuck it I'm in
yes but the question is, does it pop tomorrow or 2 years from now?

are we in 1998 or 2001

What's the problem
Same
+30%
My dude got a Cramer shout out. Excellent
I was working at WalMart when this started. I had a friend who was working part time making 10 an hour who lost is job, and suddenly was making more than me while I was dealing with crazed Karen’s demanding toilet paper and hand sanitizer. While I and all my older coworkers were being exposed by these people.

&#x200B;

There are people who definitely need it and overall I get why it’s important. But those situations like I described almost feel insulting
I advocate for another paper trading competition
He told Cathie Wood to buy a half a million shares.
Part of the problem is we don't educate kids about money and basic finance and how to save and grow your money. Everything I know about those things I had to learn myself. All the useless shit they teach kids and don't spend 5 minutes on budgeting and credit, etc etc
I would be so in the fucking money if that happened.  Like lean fucking fire type in the money.
I should bought more when it was at 3$ but I am shell shocked on weed stocks but very happy with it now... just need acb to hit 100 and hexo at 50 and I can be happy 😅
ARK?
One of us.  One of us.
Yolo's only go up I've been told.
What did he say that will make BB rocket?
It is statistically true. Go read the study in the original post.
When can I book a colonoscopy with you?
I grew up super poor. 

We never had money so mom taught me how to save every penny. 

I just bought her a house last year. 💕
You mean VYM?
It’s official... 0 for 3 on spy calls LMFAO
Honestly I yolo'd on $BB at 8.54, but after doing some DD (seeing all the 🚀🚀 here) I'm probably holding for a few months at least.
He also said taxes
Only on wsb do you find someone buying \~15k worth of calls for the wrong year but still going up 100%+
Arkk didn’t buy plntr it was Ark w. So probably
They sold their phone Ip to Huawei, they can't
I picked up 2 (I know, I'm not rich) $10 9/17c for BB a while ago.  I figured, why not.  I'm curious to see what they get up to this week.
Hamilton unites us all
Reddit is in command

Batman forever
Do not hesitate buying tommorow. It is never too late, look at GME. I bought today when it was already up 15 percent and expected a short term  correction but it continued to moon.
Wait till you open your trading account in the morning and your unrealized gains is gone.
Just bought a couple 1/22 $12c - will they print????
So excited for you. I remember my first real profit. And I cashed it out. $8000.00. Remember, you don't make or lose money until you sell. Avoid the negative news too. I can't tell you how many times I punched out due to negative news. One time it was NFLX. I bought super low and then around 2008 or 9 or 10, I forgot when but Netflix announced they were raising their monthly fee and lots of people were dropping the stock. I thought, well due to ignorance, I should too. I would have been a hundreds of thousandair if I had not. Just stick in there and Invest in companies that you truly feel are worth their weight in Gold. Can't go wrong with solid companies.
Watch Rogue Trader with Obi Wan. Movie about a dude YOLOing on futures and blowing up his firm.
NOW... We all decide when to sell and we all buy puts and make millions.
Cathie > Citi
Yea
Not gonna lie, GME, PLTR, CCIV and BNGO just might make me 100k this week. I'm fucking retarded
Look, i'll give you credit for the meme. But, your most recent pick was total disaster and it looks like you spend most of your time making youtube videos.  Sooo i now believe your DD is garbage. See ya at $60.
Yes **buying MORE**
No point spending money on depreciating assets
$15 tomorrow.
What was the PLTR news?  +6% AH
Hey thanks
There a bunch of index funds that have done better than 15% on their 10-year annualized returns. I wouldn't call it "incredibly difficult".
I no longer want to wake up with morning wood. I want to wake up with Cathie Wood

If it makes you feel better I had call for 8,10,12 that expired last week instead of this one rip.
Fuck finally was hard to hold but worth 🚀🚀
Sit on my face Cathie 🪵

I’ve been in with 120 shares for weeks. To the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
It’s primed for a nice run right now, yesterday would’ve been perfect time to go in but I think it’ll run for a while
Yes
Remember bears "Red at night, Bulls delight" you know how it goes
How is reddit different?  Like I know the actual differences but I get caught in the same senseless scrolling as I do on the other platforms.  I turned off my notifications for the other apps and reddit litterally uses the same tricks to get you logged back in.  So now I am debating nixxing the reddit notifications as well.
APHA already up 27% today.
10.5c 1/29🙌
And Goldmans and sustainable Opportunities
Wish I cashed out of ICLN while it was pumping. Now all my money is tied up in that while everything else moons.

I bought TLRY high and sold low, then it got high without me like a bad stoner friend. YW.
Tbh it's kinda retarded to say it's $2,000 at this point if they only give a remaining $1,400 - why not just say here's $800, congrats on your $2,000 and account for the first cheque too.
Yessss
Yeah that's what I was thinking and it could mean disaster for a few/lot companies they own. Future will tell I suppose.
why the fuck did the GME shares go from 25k to 100k with smaller percentage fees?
FDS = write offs forever!!

A retards guide to getting rich:

Step 1) short squeeze GME 🚀 ✔

Step 2) EXCERSIZE your GME contracts mid week next week and HOLD!

Step 3) Hold half your profits in GME shares and take the other half and buy what traditional investors would call you a retard for... ridiculously risky PLTR calls! (They are sooooo not risky if we all do this and get fucking rich together lads!!!🚀🚀🚀)

Do you mean this? 

It didn’t touch on how worthless puts affect share price though. I understand how they’re fked if it’s a short naked call. But I thought long puts are just turning into worthless paper instead?
Once again inversing wsb pays off
$15 bucks an hour makes you RICH AF guys 

and then your hours get reduced, then the price of everything goes up, and 15 bucks suddenly seems like 7 bucks...

so we need 25 an hour, minimum!
KTOS was still up 10% today
Also calling people pussy over the internet. Very edgy. Maybe try caring less about the opinions of social media addicts.
This just in: Stocktwits is bearish on gme and also retarded.
6.5%. Let's see if it holds.
Lol... It is going to minimum 50. Every time consoles release... Look at the charts.
Cathie bough 500k shares. Everyone buying ah. News gonna get out tommrow and stock is gonna skyrocket. DEMO next week and earning soon after. All these new contracts pay a percentage upfront so earning r going to be a beat.
With your tax dollars and the tax dollars if your grandchildren which will also be spent this year.
Fuck boys guess it’s time for PLTR 2.0 squeeze buying my weeklies tommorow fuck let’s go cathie
Yeah one of them just got arrested yesterday

Not this guy, they are staying. They sold because of a rule about owning too much stock in one company, that a firm they work for has a rule about. It already happened and was bought up.
Fuck them kids they’ll pay for it
How much is a reasonable amount to invest?
Hearing their furniture is trash .    Is that true?
Am I lucky for jumping in PLTR calls on today’s dip or what? 🚀🚀🚀
Deleted there account LOL
This guy is delusional. People will buy food and pay rent? Just direct deposit it RH and be done with it.
I third the wall of texts sentiment...

That said, the big things that come to mind is end of life items. Who inherits your stuff? Who makes medical decisions if you are incapacitated? Beyond those basics, nothing really comes to mind.

NP. MSOS etf is a good although pricier option if you’re trying to get in on some of the US marijuana companies, otherwise you have to trade the US weed companies on foreign markets.
Sorry noob here, what's PLTR? Is that a stock I should be looking at? Any specific names would be greatly appreciated kind sir. I've been getting ravaged recently
ALL OF THEM
SPY flat = call fuk
My wife and I make more than enough money and invest/save responsibly like the boomers tell us to, I’m just on here to yolo and try to get fuck you money. 

That last part is corporate propaganda again. They aren’t gonna go anywhere.
Serious...
Bought some  pltr
Ok this stock was up 22% today and then 15% more after hours.... What gives?
This sub sometimes is ridiculously smart but holy shit does it's actual stupidity outshine it. ICLN is a fucking ETF. How may times you actual retards need to hear this? I'm seeing dozens of comments here pointing out that ICLN being up 1% AH is disappointing. That's what an ETF does you fucking potato brain. I literally cannot wait for all of you idiots to get out of this ETF so it can go back to having another 150% gain over this year.
GME is where everyone with PS5s are now spending their money on games.
Actually they're only accumulating as I have BB calls
10"
More gme
Shame you didn't wait another day for those calls as it looks like you would have had more money tomorrow, but good for doing the smart move.
no demo day next week which she prob have insider knowledge it will bring the stock to the moon
I bought one 50C because I had $120 sitting in cash. If it prints I’ll part the Red Sea and tub girl myself.

Did Joey fall asleep mid speech or something?
So Cathie bought PLTR. Let the battle begin
Anything in particular causing the recent excitement in Bb?
PLTR mooning after hours probably because of ARK's trade email. They bought a lot of PLTR shares today. I think last time they bought some was in November.

He had to sell because he owned more than a 20% stake in the company. I believe he sold most of it yesterday. He would’ve sold if it had been at $3 or $300.
Yes
I’ve had a hard time finding vehicles to reduce tax liability, any suggestions? (Not being sarcastic)

I cannot fund a traditional IRA due to my income level, outside of that I’m maxing out my HSA but that’s a max of what like $3600 or so a year which is shit. I have the normal $3k loss I carry over years as well. Not quite sure what else to do that would be significant, legal and not get audited and penalized to the moon by the IRS
Anyone buying more tomorrow👀👀👀👀👀👀
Great DD, all in

Yeah, it is 26.56 right now AH.
Well, there are a couple of ways I’d suggest:

1. Use some scanners. And not only stock scanners but also news.
2. Pick a sector, navigate.
3. Which I am guilty of: find few successful traders and follow them (as in, follow their strategy in terms of how to scan and conduct DD). Once in a while you get to see some stocks that made it on their radar and could be worth spending some researching those.

I think when we speak penny stocks... scanners are best for scalps and swings. But then again, you may stumble across a gem once in a while. I can’t stress how important it is to do your own DD, especially on penny stocks.
It's so lame.

TV MAN MENTION REDDIT?? OO OO AA AA
Unbelievable. I'm in.
And BB actually will make money. It's like ZM
The prophecy has been completed. Pltr + gme mooning together tomorrow!
Good show.

I put 3 figures and am already at 4. Only 2 to go!
Im stuck in feb 19 $21cc. FOMO, bought more shares, sold puts today. Saw the ridiculous option prices today and sold more calls. Immediately regretted that decision with, “what the fuck are you doing?” Closed cc’s even money and bought more shares and sold more puts.
That only makes me want to buy more
OMG just read Cathie I approve  🔥  🚀
What does this mean bro
Not this time, pal
Godspeed, my good autist.
I also realize that I don’t know how to add a picture
Sounds more like a party but I’m in
this is a joke right
Robinhood now allows 0dte option purchasing until 3 pm eastern day of expiry.
Red to green. It always happens
I invest from my Fidelity IRA, can I do option or am I just that autistic?
So what now. What’s going on with this sleepy talk
Go back to r politics you shitbird.
Cathie saving me from bagcarrying PLTR 

#ALSO ICLN U BITCH MOON!!!
Dude. Fuck SPY! It hasn't been worth fucking with since the pandemic started and my dumbass still fucks with it.
That would be great for my CSP.
This was originally all burry’s play fyi
😂
Big up, big down. Usually settles slightly undervalued then slowly moves back to "normal" movement. So 2 questions remain, how big will the squeeze be and what is actually fair value. 

I think fair value is ~$60. Yes, that's near ATHs, but GME was valued $60 with DOUBLE the existing shares. So that's $30 based on previous ATH valuation. Very reasonable with RC at the helm.
It was hilarious because when it was going up 4 or 5% day after day a month ago, I was making about 25% or more on my calls. Just fucking disgusting gains day after day after day.
The only limit is your imagination, or possibly the moon
L O L
GM still got room to run?
Stay in
i sold a little bit to get to a round number....... does that count?
$24C 1/29! Let’s goooooooo.

That said, is the SEC taking notes \*scribbling in notepad\* 'wallstreetbets plotting to destroy short sellers' now we're going to login one day and see giant crime bureau tape on the front of wsb and its shut down.  Thanks, Cramer!
i like this analogy
ballz
You guys better not sell off GME at opening!😠 I am in!! Don’t let GME down!
I am indeed new to investing. Opened a ETrade account a week ago and put $2k into AAL. Got to start somewhere lol

This is fucking awesome
What? Why? Isn't it like my right what I view the price of the stock at? Sorta like selling a house. I can list it for whatever I deem it's value at. If the market isn't interested, that's life.

Could be someone buying to cover the call they sold (basically buying it back).
Just what I needed for some of my calls expiring tomorrow lol
What????
bul is fuk
You'll be having steak and lobster by the end of it.
can a motherfucker get some BBM back?  Bitches in high school loved BBM
I think ICLN just needed to get settled back to it's moving average for the last year, it jumped pretty heavily recently. Hopefully/probably Biden's plans will get it moving again
Anybody else bullish on inflation?
Mods we need Cramer to do AMA here
So you can make your stock unavailable for borrowing by setting a limit to sell order. All my GameStop shares that aren’t in covered calls I save set a “limit to sell” meaning they are unavailable to be borrowed because they are committed. I have limit to sell at like $100 $200 and $300. It means if the stock hits that price it automatically sells my shares but also that they aren’t available for someone to borrow and sell
Glad to have you on a winning team
I’ve been thinking about getting the PS5 but it wouldn’t be the digital only version...why you ask? Because when I want a new game a year from now and the wife says “get some of the other games you don’t play anymore and trade them in” guess where I’m going? GME

Damm Cathy Woods, are you the US capitol? Cause I wanna bust in you

I feel like your username is a setup for people who's going to buy at the absolute ATH after the violent squeeze to $1000
I requested after hours trading on Fidelity.
Ngl I miss the 🥭 speeches. 

Dude was so fuckin funny.
A handful of RH users, and those on any other platform. This site only counts RH holders, which makes it pretty unique.

Depending on the stock it could be a hand full of old super owners with most of the shares slowly selling, or previous bagholders from way back. A lot of penny stocks used to be 10 bucks and such years ago and tanked or diluted. Sometimes our graph doesn't go back far enough, but there are only a few ways to go public. Uplist from otc, IPO, spac merger or those split off and reverse merger styles. Depending on the source those current owners could be way down or way up. And sometimes a few people hold so dang much it is crazy. Lastly, new shares can be offered in different dilution causing ways, direct offering type ways etc. For stocks that existed but needed more capital to continue their plans. Same company, same overall-ish worth, but now split among more shareholders.

So, could be an old dead stock someone is happy to be out of finally, an uplisted, an IPO gone poorly, or a slowly diluted stock that just never had the capital to achieve its goals. Either way, someone owns them, and Robinhood folks are buying from them to show up on this graph.
Is it true ARK purchased 50 million dollars worth of PLTR shares in the afterhours?!?!?!
My GME and BB stocks doing good. Sounds like a discount on tech though
It's going to be an exciting year with Cathy on our side 😍 good luck to us 🥂
P R I C E D I N
Is this for everyone ???
You could get a partial share through Robinhood
Haha remember pltr?
cramer said it?

fuck, that means it's over
Even if you, a wsb retard, didn't play GME or BB and still didn't make money this week, idk what to tell ya.

Literally everything is green.
i mean we've been pumping for like 2 weeks with the title "stimulus hopes"
Ok so I missed the speech tonight...any good news for steel?
All my meme stonks are like 2% green?
This is, by far, the funniest meme I've seen here.

Hats off to you sir.
Will my PLTR 29c 1/15 print tomorrow?
Oh ok thank goodness. I saw this and almost thought it was similar to an offering, lol. Totally different though, I see now. Thank you for the clarification!
I am full YOLO on BB after being YOLO on GME and TSLA.  This is the way.
This makes me genuinely happy for everyone that cashed in. Congrats retards!
If you think bears here are annoying, go to Stocktwist or Yahoo. They're losing their shit about $GME lmao.
Wait, why aren't the networks covering the [Q&A?](https://kapwi.ng/c/m4eqAXhM)
It’s always a treat coming to WSB’s, seeing panic, not seeing my tickers mentioned and then opening RH to see I’m way up. Inverse!
1/8, 1/12, 1/13, and 1/14 are their most recent purchases. Today is obviously their biggest.
Gme shares

While I don’t agree with raising minimum wage, it’s been proven that isn’t the case. We haven’t raised minimum wage in years, in a way to actually represent its previous value when implemented. Prices have increased without a raise in minimum wage because, profit.
I am from the future
It’s only a matter of time before greed sets in and everyone starts selling
Pls stay below $29 for tomorrow so I don’t have to either have my shares called away or roll
Futures were green till 4AM two nights ago then opened red.

About 2.5 inches
Never again with AAPL. They suck butt
I’ll say it again. It is bullshit that I’m forced to play 0DTs to make up lost ground bc the govt thinks making 99k is too much to get a stimulus.
Also mentioned increased corporate taxes.
I’ll check the nearest grocery store and get back tomorrow.

> Kia is also developing a range of new Purpose-Built Vehicles (PBVs) for corporate customers. These specialized vehicles will be based on flexible 'skateboard' platforms, with modular bodies designed to meet the specific mobility needs of a broad range of corporate and fleet customers. Partnerships with the likes of Canoo and Arrival will mean Kia PBVs can offer different bodies mounted on top of an integrated modular 'skateboard' platform, tailored to users' functional requirements.

Legit actually fucking retarded, but count me in too
Im up 130% on GME shares, up 15% on BB (i bought today), up over 150% in CRSR and 60% on NIO.

I swear every single stock this sub suggets works if you're just smart enough to not bet your house on weeklies. Thanks for making me so much money guys, i appreciate it.
This.  New to the investing world.  Only one week in and I've already noticed that if something ended trending quite high, the next morning you should expect a dip  and buy within 30-60 minutes of opening.  

Does this tend to be the case for most pennies?  Or am I only paying attention to the most volatile ones?
Cathie Woods from the rafters with a folding chair!!! SHE DID IT FOR THE BOYS #PLTR

Well I don't know a ton about it as I had to make my decision quick as I noticed it popping off early afternoon. From what I was quickly able to read is that it is a long term cgm where as others on the market are more temporary and have to be replaced more often. Hoping to get some reading done this evening and to verify that and other things.
People who watch Cramer have no idea what Reddit even is
Fake sell off by low volume PJ traders. Dip will get bought up at open.
Holding shares is helping. dont sell
GME gang what a great fucking battle today once again..

Instead of closing, the shorts are doubling down and suppressing the price hoping the hype for GME will fade and the volume will drop. 

The short interest is still absolutely insane and we will find out tomorrow for definite the numbers on it.

Possibly once in a lifetime play

Enjoy.
reminder: gme shorts still have more dick to take

Get in before it’s to late 35 EOW.
Memes aside, what's happening to all the GME shorts tomorrow?
Fair enough. I didn't like ZOM either, which is why I didn't touch it.
Well again, ive never bought an option before, but my retard logic here is that the price falling below 6.50 feels unlikely, and if the i dont close the option for profit i really wouldnt mind buying 100 shares for 6.50 each. I want to believe
Citi is a bunch of boomers. Old school and worthless. Ark is the new investors way!
How are some of you surprised that stimulus is priced in? Literally the second those last two senate seats were won by dems in Georgia it became obvious.

Next thing to look forward to: once we start seeing vaccination numbers it’s to the moon y’all. Airlines, ABNB, CCL, etc etc. They’re aiming for 100mm vaccinations in 100 days.
Sounds good to me.

Also the fbi servers are powered by Blackberrys new software.

Also new cop cars are going to be Blackberry QNX EVs.

Im too pussy to buy a put on GME so i bought some puts for XRT.

Pussy.
Irrelevant. Nice try. You’re blocked.
I think it'll get through with it.  Hopefully they at least delay it by a year or two before it takes effect... because raising min wage like that will only increase unemployment and kill the almost dead small businesses.
Nope, he will have his buying power slashed by about 120% in your state. And, he will not get a pay raise as that money is allocated to the welfare wage.
I found out about Cramer on digg
I got 382 cause I thought it was a good entry at close
Thank you. “Over 10 years” really sticks out; so it’s not just a year or two to measure gains, but look at the long haul projection.
Is that’s $20 in 2023 or 2020 money?
Yes, you should be investing your retirement savings not letting it sit in the settlement fund, usually employer retirement plans have a set of specific fund options, log on to your account and it should show those options, if you can't find it then try customer service for guidance, it's possible your plan allows you to pick any fund Schwab has to invest it, though that's a bit more rare to have available
I’m ready

I've written literally 100 responses by this point. It's not guaranteed but the odds are good for a gamma squeeze + short squeeze + new direction excitement combo. It's not a guaranteed win, but the odds of a miracle are high enough that its a play worth trying.
PLTR is the stock ticker for Palantard
Yep, 497k shares.
I have seen dozens of comments since after Biden saying they're getting out of it because it's only up 1%. Sorry but those retards need to be called out. And don't kink shame me. What my girlfriend does with her boyfriends and me is between me, her, them, and the people that pay to watch me crying while she gets gangbanged.
Meanwhile I have absolutely no idea what the hell is happening.
Where ?
PLTR after hours... its time..
Ok gld and slv. Time to get really worried about inflation with all this money flyin around everywhere. Let me see slv 25 tomorrow and ill throw all my gains into anything cathie tells me to
People bitching about ICLN not making them money or making them lose money... Are you guys dumb? Their top two stakes are  PLUG and ENPH! These two are at a ridiculous ATH! We just saw analysts take a shot at PLUG and that made ICLN take a hit. ENPH will probably follow suit, affecting ICLN as well. With that said, I don't see ICLN moving up like it did these last couple of weeks until the new administration starts signing things into action early Feb. 

I had $30 calls for 3/19 that I got in early december and I'm glad I got out. ICLN will probably dip soon because of PLUG and ENPH and when that happens, I'll jump back in again.

Melvin must be down an absurd amount of money already this year and we’re going to continue taking their money for at least the next month. A LOT more of it.
Cathy added more shares
CATHIE BAEEEEEEEEE
Oh that’s a spicy premium I paid 2 bucks per contract lol I bought 3 for a total of $600 all in expiring 1/29.
Finally, someone gets it
If futures were down 1%, I’d be concerned about tmrw.
Let's close all citi checking accounts. How dare they downgrad PLTR
What app is this?
What’s a promising alternative?
Cant pay taxes if you don’t have a product or income 🧠
Yes. It’s ridiculous
If you out any stock in PE ratio Facebook is actually undervalued compared to average S&P stock. Trefis estimates say it vastly undervalued as well, they put it at 321. Not that either of these metrics are 100% reliable but I don’t think it’s a stretch to call FB value at this price.
Single ply hands
SEC gonna arrest me for market manipulation lol
their gonna google how to tie a proper rope knot
Sight to behold! My bags feel lighter already
Split, call it risk management lol
figure out how much $15 an hour is as a salary. it's absurdly low, no one can have a life or future on that. and the bumfuck states in certain parts only have those types of jobs so that means everyone needs to move to cities.
They already owned 1.9 million prior to today. But yes this confirms by bias even further so I'm in.
Cathie 🪵 own the market and my body.
how does one go about getting this job?
Finally found posts on Yahoo.  ON Semiconductor.  
OK good stuff but seriously what type of name is ON anyway?  Boomers do not get it - a name like that is seriously NOT going to get any good search results.  
And the ticker name is ON too.  Seriously?
I can’t wait to get out of piece of shit AAPL.
Upvoting to spread the truth
Ok
He said infrastructure several times.
found him, this guy right here, he's retarded.
Said in the coming weeks
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-package-details-checks-unemployment-minimum-wage.html

 "The second bill, expected in February, will tackle the president-elect's longer-term goals of creating jobs, reforming infrastructure, combating climate change and advancing racial equity."

Combating Climate Change is loosely thrown in to the article.
As a skateboarder I fuck wit this
Ally app showing me going back to -1%. I will just wait for morning market open. I gotta stop looking.
This is war. It is. It absolutely is.

Yep loaded up on more March 95c hopefully it breaks 100 after earnings
except there was the Trump Randomizer that could go off on a tangent at any moment.
Tell him it was the meme
I’m very new to this as well so I’m not sure but you probably can, just have to opt into it typically. If you were truly autistic, you would have all the answers. 
Not sure about the flair.
Love those holdings
I FOMOd hard into G I K. Am I still going to print?
I like to read this. I missed GME and got ran over hard on me Tesla short (should have known better!) so I’m hoping BB has a similar meteoric rise. I ain’t selling for a while. That’s why I bought my calls out so far.
Usually they auto sell, not auto exercise. Institutions buy that shit up in droves because it is basically risk free profit that only requires a ton of capital.
Goddamn 🌈🐻 pajama traders shorting the market
Decreased demand sounds good for fighting depletion of the sea
Cathie gonna pull a 0DTE in and out tomorrow
Yes especially PLTR calls
Why is palantir moo ing?
Sweet, looking forward to fda approval ✌🏼
Idk but we really can’t be far off... everyone and their grandma is buying stocks based on hype and what’s hip and cool. I really don’t see TSLA reach $1000 before it pops
Knowing me I would have panic sold for a loss anyways so probably for the best
Why is every Tinder bio “loves to laugh”. Wtf does that even mean lmao
All the faang stocks
There’s some truth to what you say. But for OP, it’s better to have made mistakes now when the stakes are low, learn why he made them, and learn how to fix it, than to make a load of money cos the market is up and then lose it all because he makes a stupid play doing something that he never had the chance to learn was a mistake, if you get what I mean?
Infrastructure bill  will be announced within a month
Sold my BB calls for 63k profit and I wish I held until tomorrow would be 350k tomorrow
Deep value sat on this for months and there was no pump. Op pumped this in less than a week
I've got my binoculars and a funnel right here, so whenever you like
BB
Pltr is up not down WTF
Damn this guy out here raking in millions and im cumming to my gain of 10k LOL
Good news for socialists
Question from someone without any kind of position in GME - why don't they take advantage of the price, and do an offering?
You never exercise... But whatever, more GME shares baby
Sleepy joe more like MASSIVE HULK COCK JOE
BREAKING: Cathie woods PT for PLTR Is 100

- WSJ
This is gonna suck when 100$ buys us half the bags of groceries we get now lol. Is inflation not a concern? Seems like we have one foot in one foot out with our plans battling covid and its just draining the economy instead of taking full measure.
8! = 40320, you are sitting on a goldmine m8
Big moves!!
Hahaha I think I got the gist of what was removed and I agree in rocket terms lol
Sooooo no 🚀🚀🚀?
GME PLTR BB are safe havens with bears debuff
BONER, ANUS, NKOTB
That sucks cuz ur only up cuz everything is up rn. You can randomly pick a stock and itll be up.
Y’all better pump BB tomorrow so I have money to spend on things other than Steel calls
It’s crazy how many couples are doing the one person at work, one person at home thing lately. Seems like there should be a sitcom show coming soon about it haha
There is barely any content on here. Used to be better.
Feds are busy with the riots right now
I hope I’m in for 1,300
Sold a July 30c on my only 100 shares monday. Had to buy that shit back for 900 yesterday once i saw the squeeze was on. Thankfully got to it just as it was crossing 30. That call is worth at least $1700 now. Never sell CCs on meme stocks. Ever.
Cathie just throwed her dump truck in your face.
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR PLTARDS, THIS IS IT.
NEE spiked up recently, could be a good long term play and has a nice dividend.
Yeah  🚀
already in it bebe.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🥰
why am I only making $5 to $100? Are you working harder than me? Contributing more to society than I am?
We're not worthy. We're not worthy.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Means they are DTF
Haven’t you people learned “sell the news.” You must in an abusive relationship with options if you haven’t learned that yet.
because commie buyden briefly mentioned tax hikes for corporations

oh and also...

_stimmy was priced in_
Why i said "slightly" against it 

Id prefer bigger stimulus and extend the unemployment benefits period and unemployment benefits qualifications
It picks up at where ever the orders price it at. I think AH and PM orders are only good for that session. Meaning the PM orders would have to be new orders, not carry overs. That doesn't mean the prices have to be different, but it means they probably are to some degree.
https://twitter.com/HedgeMind/status/1327415592291160064?s=20
why is palantir up? 

🚀🚀🚀
I am literally blown away that Palantir is up AH. I just sold my $26c 1/15 for -90% EOD. Unreal dude lmao
VALE will pay off my tuition. To the fucking moon!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Get on Petco (woof)
Other than just buying ICLN, how are you playing the clean energy bill?
The question is, how much did you have invested in March? It’s different to see a few thousand dollar drop than it is to see a six figure drop.
r/angryupvote
Better to pay it off right AFTER the 0% interest expires anyway!
This is why I can’t ever trust anyone who says literally anymore. Because people literally always say literally and don’t literally mean literally. It literally drives me insane.
Sorry I should have been more specific. Which ark fund? Arkk or?
They do. But please check out most ARKs over a span of a week. They have had many weeks of being stale or red. You deal with that so that you can be around for the many, many green days.
obama is back in office, only through a proxy that is way less charismatic
I will sell my fucking kidney to buy more $BB.

Let's fucking GOOOOOOOOOOO 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Why :( I’m trying idk stock lingo I just put money in pls dont hurt me
Beware, this article is misleading. Only the paper-handed b*tches are claiming victory.

deepfuckingvalue (DFV) Hands know this is only the beginning 💎👐

Alexa, play “We Still in This Bitch (feat. TI and Juicy J) by B.o.B”
My main concern is about how long will this last?
If this squeeze finishes next week, I might baghold on the puts I sold. 

What is a realistic price we might be back at after squeeze has squozen? Is it in the $35 range? I hope it is at least that or more.
😍😍😍
I came thank you
They literally cant
There's over 1 million people in this group dude hahaha
Cuz if they don’t I’ll be broke
So if they exercise the put that means they have to sell the shares at that price. Do they have shares to sell?

If so, it won’t affect the price, right? Shares are being bought and sold, issued ones are not being bought.

if they have to buy shares to cover, would they buy from the existing issues shares? I’m confused.
You can go to the ark website and subscribe to their daily buys
Okay? So go petition your state to raise the minimum wage. 

There's no reason for the federal government to get involved.
So the government giving my money back or redistributing wealth is a stimulus? How nice of them.
where do you follow those moves?
If you are moving to Asia I wouldn't buy. If you are fine with living with your parents just keep doing it, who cares (guessing you might be Asian? me too). Personal space would be less needed after the pandemic is over would be my guess.
How do you think they'll do on earnings on the 2nd? Worth getting in now or could there be a potential dip?
Cathie bought
True but blackrock can just rebalance and we be ok
$500 it is.. I don’t got much to be putting in 😞 was hoping to get more squeeze from GME tho so idk
positions or gtfo
a rogue wave is coming for you shorters
$WDLF gonna throw a few bux at it
Something must have leaked midday about this IMO
May the GME gods rain tendies down upon you and save you from your wageslave life.
Ark-funds.com
So 2021 is gonna be the year of the short squeeze? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
No, we need minimum wage, full time work to be properly compensated.

I don’t see Bezos out here on the COVID frontlines, bagging my fucking groceries or working the pharmacy.
Same $55/share sounds like a deal tomorrow 😵
I believe that the fair price of the company right know is about 20 billion and keep in mind and that's without the premium that most investors are ready to pay for growth tech stocks. That is almost 30 percent upside. With the wsb hype it might reach 15 tommorow 🚀🚀
Threesome with cathie and AOC would be epic
I wanna get into $BB tomorrow morning... too late? or nah
Link pleas
Im not that far ahead, its 1am January 15th 2021
PLTR up 6% in AH, I choose to believe it's because of this masterpiece.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Between Biden IT and cybersecurity funding and Aunt Cathie we are going 🚀🚀🚀.

P.s. In Cathie we trust 🚀
I’m never play apple again. Ever been burned 3 times

Ain’t wrong right now but infrastructure spending and getting out of this pandemic is gonna be slow pumping

Ark is buying it.
Same bother I saw his post in august and I thought it was too late to catch the full moon. I was in other plays so didn’t have the funds.It had me dead because people were calling him a retard when he started making his post.
Fine I’ll do it
Then get fired? Idk why people are bashing free money which will raise equity prices which isn’t that why we all are here??
Swear loudly as things don't go according to ~~investment thesis~~ hopium

Same, 100 @ 16.
Cathie

Green by open.
While I agree, it has already gone to the moon and mars over the past couple months. 2.7 billion market cap and 807x P/E, I missed out on almost buying this when it was around $16, I think it’s way too expensive now.
I’m getting in at open!

My post doesn’t violate anything that comment mentions, and Its a question from a new person trying to develop a strategy. Im not asking for people to do work for me, I want to do the work myself which is why I asked for ways to pick ones to research, no ones that people picked because they researched it already.

Reinforcements inbound, loading $GME and $BB shares again tomorrow.  Then setting sell order at $999.
Lmao same spy is bull flagging on the charts tho in real market hours so we definitely gapping up tomorrow morning
Ummmm Portland federal court house?  You know when your dem overlords were inciting and cheering them on.  Short memory I see.
I imagine they have some free money on the side, should be worth about 1% of ARKW now
It’s just the beginning
Very nice
I’m still reading the turtles book. Do you mind sharing how your experience has been so far?
BB 🚀🚀🚀
Scroll down
Yes squeeze time we might go higher then GME buckle up and buy your weeklies like I am tommorow
PLTR gonna disappoint all call holders. Its done mooning, going to sell off in PM tmrw. This shit simply wont moon until lockup period is over.
Close day 34-35
350
Just bought this :D well, the Canadian equivalent. Let's go!!! MOON.
Hopefully it moves a lot by 2/19
No, but this is probably best advice there is.
If it passes that's bullish for $AMZN
Yesterday. We said buy yesterday
Jesus pleas fly to 34 tomorrow so my calls don't expire worthless 🙏
I skimmed the article looking for “Canoo & 🚀🚀🚀” is this legit?

Did he say they could get closed out by force?
If Cathie Ark can get me to 100, I'm retiring
Citi downgrades pltr and it moons .

Go fuck your self citi group , you are a bunch of morons who couldn’t get into an actual hedge fund so has to resort to being sellside cuckholds
Well this sub hasn't shut up about GME for weeks lol, he's in.  Think he also took a payday to propose that 5mil dilution this morning as well.
I’ll say it again: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
And even fewer girls.
Bought in fact 400K shares not 25K
Cause they'll fuck us right in the ass and it'll go back to $20. They can offer once we reach $100
Was literally just going to post something about this. GME was the first stock I ever wrote covered calls for. I wrote about 3 of them and I was actually thinking that after the one I have that expires this Friday, I would just hold the stock.


Sure enough the stock sky rocketed and my shares will be called away tomorrow. It's a weird feeling. I'm about to net a good chunk of change but it just feels like I'm saying goodbye.

I figured a pretty good price in general for the stock, so i sold a 1/22/21 37p @8.36 figuring 29 per share would my spot. Sure as shit , the stock took off more. So unless this thing crashes, I'll be collecting more premium.

It's weird because I actually wanted to be assigned.
ima gonna needa link for that
33.64 unfortunately
Plug power and nel asa directly tho I got out yesterday.... that bubble gonna bust soonish

Considering VW didn’t last more than 2 days, I’m scared of having too much money in April calls.

My impulse Vale 20c monthly gonna take me to tendieland
now that the GME wsb short squeeze has made the mainstream media i'm REALLY not looking forward to the next 6 months where every every post you see on WSB is made by someone with a summer 2020 join date and is basically just "THIS IS GONNA BE THE NEXT GME SQUEEZE GUYZ SHORTS R FUK LOL!"
I am using TDA and have a giant warning telling me about my margin call.

The first line is very direct - *You are in a margin call*

Then the explanation is the exact opposite -

*A potential maintenance call means action may be required if your account goes into a call. *

So it calls it 'potential' and says action 'may be required' but only if the 'account goes into a call'

So if the account doesn't go into a call, then it's irrelevant right? Even then there's no forced call options that have been bought, so no action at all would lead to me going into a call.

Is this right and it's just trying to cover their asses?

The first thing you read though is that *'you are in a margin call'*
This should be given ALL the medals
Nice! Just bought late Jan calls and I picked up some stocks this AM. Feeling good on BB.

Miner margins go to 0 in the long run. Not even that long, actually. Sell as soon as it pumps. Bitmain will simply increase the price of mining equipment until the miners make $0.

Also, when do you plan to sell your calls? You going to hold over the weekend?
This will go to $100. Any less, you are screwing us.
icln and enph is only about 10% of total holds combined. other shit be dragging it down with it.
12.78
😔
Live Laugh Love
Just CMPS. It seemed like the best option at the time I bought. However, I can't remember why that was.
Dividend is the only reason why I am still hold on to it since 2019. I got around 44 shares.
Got a 10c for 9/17 before close. Thought for sure i was gonna have a read day correction tomorrow but i guess not. Buying more shares whenever its red
Smart
hey bulls, atleast look on the bright side of things. A healthy correction tomorrow and next week is actually bullish
but until then, we gonna party like its 1999
Big boys play futures
Alrighttttt

*Just* another 13% and my calls won’t expire totally worthless tomorrow
I trade on 30 min timeframe. I plan on trading all the major pairs. Should I test each pair?
SE, DKNG, MELI
You do realize we’ve heard and seen this before, right?
You know, Quasimodo predicted all this
It's not just EVs, there will be an increasingly heavy push to shift away from fossil fuels and into clean energy this decade.  That sentiment is not going away ever.  Either the world funnels an enormous amount of money into clean energy or climate change fucks the planet and stocks are screwed anyways.  But it will take a long time and oil could easily continue to see a huge rise.  Nonetheless, disruption is here to stay and I would never bet on oil for that reason, but I sure as shit won't be shorting it either.

Why would they be
You can read the comments other people write on the “screen” if you scroll down with a “mouse”(the clicky thing)
Stfu gay 🐻
It’s 100% a gamble. Basically I’m placing a bet that the price will go up to 55 and if surpassed 55 I have the option to buy it at 55 even if the goes to 100🚀🚀🚀if I choose exercise the option. Or I can cause to close out the option and collect the difference.
Okay!
YES
.... they're fine enless you 🧻👐
I’m currently in Walmart, and I have a problem. So I’m supposed to be looking for some crackers because my mom is making chili. And when I got to the crackers aisle, a strong odor hit me. I looked up, and saw two people wearing some religious garbs. (They just walked past me on a different aisle😭😭) anyways, the smell was so strong I literally couldn’t go down the aisle🤮. This shit is about to piss me off because I was supposed to be home a while ago, I wasted a lot of time trying to book this hooker, only to find out she raised her prices. Now I have to wait for half of Walmart to air out😑. Either it’s them, or someone hid a dirty diaper somewhere. This shit is fucked up....
With 1.9T put into the economy it sure as fuck should be. Too bad the markets dont follow logic
Even if we dont open green, surely non us here placed their life savings on calls expiring tomorrow im sure
I'm new here but even if it is being manipulated what's the risk with jumping in when the price is low and selling when it gets higher?
Oh yeah I'm retarded
seriously
So what’s my 31c PLTR 1/15 gonna do tomorrow...can I even sell them?
They have an investor conference tomorrow, rumors of more EV involvement and overall improvement/ develeipement  over the last year
RESPECT🚀🚀🚀
The US is in a terrible place right now. Why do certain people have to be so polarizing? We can have different views and still get a long. At the end of the day we’re all Americans and I’m sick of seeing people fight for no reason. All of this energy is directed towards nonsense when it should be directed towards advancing civilization. I hope Biden’s campaign brings us all together

I'd be surprised if your company, given its size, didn't have HR to help perform this function. I'd talk to her about what the logistics would look like.
Same exact dude does a video for Robinhood. I imagine it’s nearly identical.

Figures, the one time I BTFD and this bullshit...   FML
Imagine the poor night time cleaning services staff at the Melvin Capital building?

Just trying to do some honest work, keep the place looking sharp and you're listening to a bunch of Brooks Brothers clad shitfucks screaming at each other over the damage wrought from not being able to walk away from the GME toaster without sticking their dicks into it over and over again.

Take the L, cover, I'm sure the government will insulate you with their corporate binky and blankie.
Day 2 of rampant growth out of iunno... a whole ass month. Seems pretty early.
Believe me.
Word on the twitter. by our GME expert u/Uberkikz11 aka Rod. is that OCC is opening $75 strikes tomorrow. One day after $55 (badly wanted 30 of those bad boys but IV was too much for me).

These might be more affordable.
Tomorrow is green and you know it.
I like to get to bed early, wake up by 530, read some wsb while I drink my coffee, and then trade while I poop.

No stress, plenty healthy.

Good looking out though ❤️
It's only a matter of time until they are listed and then shares will blow.
APHA is a goddamn BEAST!!
Guess I was wrong about APHA. Congrats to holders.
Imagine being this retarded
Which stock? Volatility of the stock might have changed.
I would also guess that GME is not a great example since they are in a short squeeze. I really don't see LEAPS on them being smart for a long hold.
Possibly, but when it was deleted it had like 100 upvotes and not much activity, so I doubt that we had the power to pump it so hard. It tested $2 in the AH. We’ll see tomorrow at the bell, but I think it’s more than just it.
Jacked to tits!
should've seen the sell orders at 420.69 on the L2. Join us
Joey money bags buyden
Alright bois, it's 2 am already in Europoor land, time to slowly get to bed. I was cheering $GME gang and made some solid money today / yesterday. I'm holding, any1 wants to confirm my bias before I take a shot and go to sleep?
I bought the top today and I’m up AH, with more volume this will print
Ill be there for my morning shit
How do I know when to stop holding 😫
Jack Dorsey looks like *The Giver* from that book you had to read in middle school
TAN is great too
When I watch 😴 talk I can literally feel IV of the entire market dropping
Means make her laugh or she’s gonna be talking to me
Who ever mentioned SENS.... godbless! Hope the numbers hold up when the market opens
How does it feel to be in that 1 lonely stock nobody cares about while everybody is partying at meme stocks?
Loves to laugh at your -90% all time RH

June? 100% fine.
I’ve had this for a while as well, I think they just roll out certain features in batches rather than to all users at once
Just put a limit order to sell good forever if you're that freaked out too
Watch the GME chart
🦂🦂🦂
You’ll be our representation in court
Short sale volume (not short interest) for $BE on 2021-01-13 is 39%. shortvolumes.com/?t=BE $SRPT 36% $CAN 44% $INO 31% $PLTR 36%

36% of the volume on the 13th was short selling for PLTR. That’s not the 60m shares but I have a screen shot of the 60m shares. Idk how to link
I wish I had 63k profit today
It’s getting ugly
Oh heck, nearly anything turns up eventually. I'll prove it.

Is etf price correlated 1:1 with holdings or can the etf price get way higher?
UNPOPULAR TAKE:

We put too much emphasis on our troops and need to move about from a militaristic focus.

It won’t happen, I know.

Fuck Citi and their shitty downgrade on pltr. My girl cathie bought up a ton today and it’s eating in the AH. I got 1/22 calls..clean
it means she's running outta options and her parents aren't gonna bankroll her bs much longer.
GOEV hitting 50 then? 🚀🚀 🚀
Waking up at 6am est to teach some classes online. Can't wait to yell at the premarket all morning after that.

Depends what you bought them for. AMD had support at $90 and it can move 3% in a day. If you bought them EOD today youll make money.
oh you can borrow stocks from thin air. that's called naked short selling
The squeeze is still on
Don't trade if Mr Market doesn't jive with your (hopefully tested) strategy. 99.9% of the time I sit on my hands. ;)
Palanbros that held. We ride at dawn 🚀

The nasal product they are releasing is not a COVID vaccine. It is a therapeutic for at-home use. There is no news on the phase 2 trials or the efficacy of the nasal therapeutic. The only thing the stage 1 trial (from Nov. 2020) states is that it was safe and well tolerated.
Ban for political bullshit and for not posting your GME positions.
It will eventually
Just blast it out loud for everyone
what did we tell you about those 1 min charts
Found Trump lurking
im with qs
You get lost on the Reddit homepage pal?
Democrats have been out of power for half a decade. What the fuck are you smoking? In one breadth these Trump supporting retards will accuse the left of being socialists and hating the military, in the other they’ll claim that it was in fact the Democrats, not the Republican majority, that raised the military budget and invaded fucking Iraq.

Cathie just iniated a short squeeze as GME
You realize schools have more pressing needs than “innovative tech”, right? Budgets have been cut nationally for years now. Listen to what people are telling you, any additional funding is going towards survival.

If you’re so sure about stimulus spending guidelines, then invest in companies providing services that will satisfy those requirements. But if those guidelines are about teacher salaries, or school lunches, or after school activities, you’re out of luck.
Yeah but Biden is black while Obama was only half.
Apha is 12.70 and Tilray is 19.50 currently, so yes it is a discount to buy APHA. Please correct me if I’m wrong. If you get 0.83 shares of Tilray, it would be worth more than 1 share of APHA at current prices.
Hahaha 😂 🍻
Trading spreads on futures options with basically no volume is [so much fucking fun!](https://i.imgur.com/iMqKrna.png) I thought the price glitched but with /RTY finally selling off a tiny bit AH the market makers made the bid ask fucking outrageously wide.  Cash market open I bet I'm still down $2,500 even if the Russell 2000 is down 5%.
No lol it’s at 10.47 still bro lol
Now that PLTR also mooned this has to be the best week in WSB history.

$GME, $BB, $PLTR.

Not to mention $TSLA last week
No worries, that’s why we all belong here.

There's apparently 42,850 55c's with you! Same link as above. If this hits 55 tomorrow we might actually see an infinity squeeze?

Don’t qualify if you fired or quit. But yeah, looking forward from an investment standpoint can see why it would be a good thing.
nice play

what calls you get? how many?
If you didn’t make money in gme today, you will make some tomorrow

Who needs analysts anymore? I grew up with Value Line, it was fantastic. Then the internet made it obsolete. So, who listens to these "experts," in a field where experts fail a bunch?
People are scared that they will have to shut down the DAPL (they won’t) which still does not justify how far they dropped. People don’t like their former CEO and founder Kelsey not Grammer. He kinda just also expanded and never cared about debt. Now he stepped down (in November I think?) and the CFO is now calling shots and he dosnt love debt. So that should make people feel warm and cozy. Barclays just upgraded them this week to overweight and raised their target to $10 from $9. It’s like the printer is on, just need WSB to
Load the paper!
They'll operate here but they'll incorporate elsewhere - they already somewhat do this so hardly propaganda. So gov can still lose on corp taxes.

There are real economic implications of *raising* taxes. That's why it's a contractionay policy.
Brilliant! This drops and guess who bought PLTR today? It's all coming together 👏
The way things are moving, the bears are gonna have to start r/bearstreetbets to have a safe space
Hasn't it 230 million shares traded in the past 2 days? How many shorts haven't covered?
Started at 5000 lost it all over 6-7 months and was left with $100. I have now turned that back into 5.1K. God damn.
Would also like to know
Been checking this stock out for a while. They have high debt and keep on giving dividend which keeps the stock price low.
Whore

How in the fuck is 2/26 nearing expiration? My guy, thats a month away
Which one you prefer currently - TAN or ARKK?
It means their personality is watching The Office and liking pizza
How can you hate ZOM??? Its a company that looked to rebuild itself not to long ago. Targeting a HUGE market that's only accelerating, with people staying home for covid. Their machine right now only does a couple of test but the machine is able to be update over the internet like a tesla. And its scalable meaning new test will be able to be implemented thru their machine. Sure there's some equipment that do some of these test. But they are bulky and outdated.
Big fuck. Shares gone.
Reddit will always get it both wrong and right, there's nothing that everyone would agree on or that stock would be obviously priced that way.  It depends on who you listen to and why.  There are dozens of posts here every week shitting the bed and dozens as well hitting the jackpot.
Is this DD or what
Yes. They’re rolling it out based on IQ in descending order. You’re scheduled for 2022.
This is what I should have done.  I stupidly sold $30 covered calls so I'm watching my gains sail on without me as the price continues to go up.  I'll still have 53 shares after tomorrow, but I should have sold puts instead of covered calls.  I'm still locked in for 100% gain on those shares ($13.87 purchase price) but damn it hurts to watch this continue to climb.  Lesson learned; albeit an expensive one.  Right now I'm leaving almost 4k on the table thanks to my stupidity.
I've known him since we were kids at school
Why would she buy Palantir before the lock-up period is over? I was waiting on the sidelines until that was over

Where do you check after hours? I usually use Google finance which doesn't show that
so brave
You don’t have to say strike, date, and price. Literally what strike is
Also, if you have margin account it doesn't matter if you have an active order I believe. only if you have cash account they can't borrow out your shares
I’m really good at missing plays
im gonna lose a lot of money tomorrow huh
Imagine if you had balls and hadn’t bought shares.
flat or down. market seemed to be pricing in that he was gonna pump up alt energy today which he didn't
I have literally no knowledge on the subject, but one thing I thought about is that an offering would make it easier for the shorts to close positions without causing the squeeze. Maybe they just don’t want to help out the people that were betting on them going bankrupt?
Which uranium etfs you reccomend?

Cathie bought it all and no ones selling
That is where they benefit - when they can sell weed in the U.S.
And this is why I held PLTR! It’s on tomorrow!!!
With the investor conference tomorrow, and this psychotic market, you never know :)
True that, investing and even making 1% return is better than just paying that shit back.

Yeah, she’ll help you to reach 99% tmr
Wish I knew.  Wonder if there's a job you can do that doesn't involve working with many people/customers day-to-day.  Forest/trail management or something like that.  Just hopefully not cleaning park restrooms...
Seriously. Regulate deez nuts!

I bought TLRY Jan 2022 20c two weeks ago, now up 125%. If it keeps going I won’t know what to do. Hoping for at least a 5 bagger.
Yeah can you guide me back? It’s getting dark out and I’m scared
God I wish I wasn't completely broke RN. I want in on this so bad. I mean, I'm still going to dump all my "entertainment" budget into shares a few at a time, but it kills me that I couldn't grab a fistful last week or even now. Pandemic finances suck!
Im already jacked to the tits, just looking for a more focused play. I’m definitely interested in seeing the bids for these government contracts
lmao WHAT
See that wasn't so hard!
Why hydrogen? Why not electricity given that we’re heading towards an electric world?

Anyone else wanna bitch smack the bears in this thread? so annoying
Yea I bought a ton when the last DD about this came out. Since then it has dropped about 5%, so it's an even better time to buy. However, I'm not sure that calls, ESPECIALLY 2/19 calls are the move. I believe the last post said that the next results on the treatment will be in 44 weeks or so. 

But otherwise,  🚀🚀🚀🚀

Do you say no on PLTR because of the skyrocketing happening tonight? Also, why do you say no to ICLN? Sorry for dumb questions, new to this and trying to learn
So... Do you become the new mod now?
$ROPE
Isn’t that just the best feeling
...fuck it, I'm buying LEAPs
I like how nothing in your text/comments say GME be we all know what this is
He is a full time trader I believe.  He tracks thousands of companies and researches promising ones for hours and hours.  He built a thesis for gamestop over 1.5 years ago when he notes discrepancy between market sentiment and actual objective information about company financials (essentially, everyone was betting that the company would go bankrupt, but the company financials demonstrated that that was highly unlikely. Plus there were several likely catalyst for upward price movement and reversion to fair value.  Hence his name - he looks for deep value in companies - its a recognized method of investing (value investor).  
    His posts inspired me to learn more myself
We won't know for sure until the January 31st when we get the report update. The recent surge is due more to Ryan Cohen stepping in with two others in my opinion. With the amount of shorts out there I think that the actual squeeze will be more drastic. I could be wrong though.
Mama Cathie buying more PLTR
Thank you, but I sold at open and went all in on gme with my remaining 10k
thanks for this useless comment
Don’t see it.
Are you me?

(Twice—$EQOS and $MARA, same day)
❤️
we good we good
Shit yeah I love when I blindly buy things that end up having a catalyst the next day
I do dabble in puts from time to time, but I sleep so much better when I'm in calls. 

Probably because I'm not fighting nature.
Lol last thing I ever will be is a bear. I am actually a PLTR call holder.
You gotta be trolling
Your boyfriend's wife's dongus.
Buy the fucking dip! 🚀🚀🚀 GME ONLY GOES UP
Could you explain this please
Smol
At the advice of this thread I YOLO’d half each into  FOMO BB and GME shares.  If the squeeze don’t get squoze tomorrow then I guess we’re all retarded. 🤡
Because he actually bought puts
Same I’m at 250 shares at $0.39. Let’s get it.
I see you PLTR!! I was wondering how my account jumped in an hour lol
Finally might get back that dipshit move of buying in at 30 the only time it fucking reached it.. I was in early too but it took a chunk of my gains when in tanked

There is no point buying stock where you have no legal claim on anything. You may as well buy baseball cards.

Seriously. Dropped $45 on it, lol.
Go back to r/investing nerd.

The best way is to just take the plunge. Whenever you're unsure of how to do what you're trying to do, just google how to do that specifically. This is what I did. Also, they have a concierge that you can call for a 1-hour personal tutorial which was very helpful. ToS is very powerful and I highly recommend it.
not too late, see you at $20
Also Theres no end to chip shortage, tarriffs. War with intel will be much worse now that they got new engineer ceo.
they can't even spell motors right. lol good luck with this pump and dump
Was it worth all the stress tho
Not so sure about the linux version but i know it exists!

Why tf is there no wsb ETF?? If we could only unite we'd all be rich af
how many of you are holding calls overnight?
America is a scam lol. Once I realized a man could con his way into the white house, and vegas was built on literal mob bosses, I said why not just join em. lol
hell yeah dude
Oh man..  that sucks.  They are only going up from here IMO so maybe jump back in.  I have a bunch of shares @ 7ish so assuming my cc gets assigned I still take a profit.  Didn’t expect it to jump this hard so fast though. 💨🚀
I'm debating on putting $5k in BB right now. This would actually be first stock investment. Would this be wise of me?
That's an aggressive strike price

Buying ICLN 1/21/22 tomorrow morning. There is no downside
Thank you mama cathie
Generally there is some premium but not a lot because of arbitrage.
Fucking heartwarming stuff, you love to see it
I need Elon to post a pltr lotr meme so I can cash out already

I cry more everyday
Let's fucking goooooooo!!!!! 🚀 👩‍🚀 👨‍🚀 🚀 
$BB
Bless her beautiful soul
Assume he paid a premium of 0.1 per share on the contract.

$0.1x100=10

As the stock price goes up, so does the premium per share. Assume the premium jumped to $1 per share.

$1x100=100.

He can now turn around and sell that call and make $90 in profits on the premium without exercising the call at all.

$90/$10=900% profit.

Full disclosure I'm a super noob retard and learned this from a YouTube video yesterday.
Thank Cathie
We don’t know
You only bought 3? How poor are you?!
What is BB projected to hit tomorrow? bc even throwing down 2k on BB and it jumping to 15 would make a net of $800 or so
Me yo
Apha BB and HUT
Solid DD.
GME
:) I like to meme but my wife is too important to me to meme. Stay cooleo Jolene
Lmao what did you do with $100
Not exactly, would be really sad to be stuck with stagnant stocks while others are doubling their money
Why are you like this?!
Screw that guy he's messed up in the head
GME puts?
GOGO
Yuge info.
He was in a coma.
It means you're using margin and you don't have enough money to cover the maintenance requirement. Tda will likely give you 5 days before taking action themselves. It's a potential call, because you have time to fix it
Stop hurting our feelings
That’s ur opinion and I respect it 🤝
Imagine having to pretend you think Joe Biden is a brilliant orator 

Calls on AAPL earnings run up imminent
Anything with cathie wood is amazing
So I sold half of my PLTR shares and bought GME.  Very conflicted feelings right now
Yeah clear as day I expect a news release tomorrow pre market pump 🚀🚀🚀🛹🌕🌕
I said in my post but yea just sell a ITM put and get shares that way
So do you think I should go for the 35c or way otm 55c? 55c is only $16 per contract, but I’m new to options trading so wondering if there’s a huge difference between going 35c $74 vs 55c $16.
I'm already in on XOM. I'll be going in on BP on the morning most likely
HOES MAD. HOES MAD!
If you’re gonna say something like this at least elaborate
I hold BABA, NNDM, GME ... fuck the last days have been good
250 @ $0.39
Like hoW!?
Dollar cost averaging at all?
you just made a bunch of nerds cream their pants for no reason i hope you feel good about yourself. it's going to 100 but shame on you cnn!
Palantir the past two months, look at us now
Bought my first option yesterday/today 2 contracts @ 1/15 40c. averaging 3.03 per share.. does this = small or big tendies if it stays above 40 tomorrow, and when does one sell on expiration date
Anyone think we see a market pullback? Eur/Usd bear 5 year highs. I bought put mid-day and covered EOD Don’t get me wrong loving the gains but These small cap short squeezes seem like the final push.
No. Just adding info if someone thought she just bought in.
AI and data analysis/presentation. I've been long on them since they IPOd and kept buying more. I've worked with them twice, it really is an amazing product.
Is it too late to get in? I see some After Market pull back.

That's Orks with a K.
HOW can she BUY
whats the 100 and then the 1000 though?
Probably not but that would be neat
yeah i had some amazon last year at 2000 and cashed out at 3100 but ive just been too nervous to hop back in at such a high price but then again 4k is just a matter of time. Amazon would be a long long hold for me anyway just like apple and CGC
you heard it multiple times guys
GAMEPLAN: BB GME PLTR 🚀
Hahahahaha
Personally I would never buy a digital consol, having to download load games I want to play every now and then which takes like a day would be a pain instead of just putting in the CD and load up the save file.
Hi Redditor, it would seem you have strayed too far from WSB, there are too many emojis detected. Try making a comment with no emoji at all.  Have a great day!

That's the name of the game
Is bb heavily shorted?
I would too, but I know the day I sell, it will reach 150
Mofo needs to apologize for not mentioning some of the great DD posters on GME...

We didn’t just band together this week and “flood social sites.”
Not sure
Lol as soon as Biden said taxes market dropped .5%. Even though we knew taxes when we voted for him. Never change, market
I'm already hard.
There has been a lot of people asking, GUIS i'M nEw to InVesting XYZ. Seriously why do they expect people to hold their fuckin hand NONE OF US KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING
This is why I love Reddit! Thank you kind stranger. There’s one thing I know for sure about options and that’s to stay the hell away lol
Here you go: R/Submissive
Probably bought gme?
how is eighty-five cents to a dollar-fifty 20x? Am i losing my mind?
Lol, you think if you’re not in PLTR you have a red PnL?
I’LL TAKE IT
Bb > icln. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Why tf is Gamestop stock going up so much? Are you saying it's all because they got some new leadership with experience in e-commerce? What are they gonna do that Amazon can't do?
It’s just a little gulley
Thanks for confirming my confirmation
You mean all the people who have made millions off GME? Shut the fuck up
gme, bb, pltr, and I’m sitting over in the corner with my nostrils full of tsla weeklies
> Dude, Democrats control both houses and senate. They can easily pass it. They don't have to negotiate with Republicans.

saying a false statement doesn't make it true. did you forget that the filibuster exists? a 50 seat "majority" isn't 60 votes.
Buy high, sell low!
Lol he mentions BYND at the end. I'm in that too and all I could think today was damnit I wish I had bought more GME instead 🤦‍♂️🚀🚀
Kill your dad
There hasn’t been much loss porn lately.... usually a bad sign
Bulls r fuk hahahahahaha
Fuck me, with stimmy passing gme is gonna explode
It's almost as if these short holders all think alike and haven't even the most rudimentary investigation. Blows my mind that people are this stupid
I love the idea, but 30 minutes into detailing my own car and I'm tired of it. haha
I bought some Amazon shares in my other account today at around 3162, and since that moment, I truly believe Amazon is a great company and worth at least 3163 so I can undo my mistake
Who buys puts? Have they not been paying attention? Are they so delusional, and lost deep inside their own assholes, that they can't hear or see anything right in front of them?
BB, GME, and PLTR til we are all millionaires
Maybe  only for certain accounts?
I wouldn't be surprised if they announce a new contract with the FBI soon.

big hedge fund short stock, stock go way up, short way out of money, big investor forced to cover short by buying gme, not much gme to buy, lots of short to cover, price go way up
tldr: stonks go up
T is a dead end, dump it.  You see it, the dividend is meaningless because the total return is pitiful.
Why dividend investors are buying this is beyond me.
Congrats and fuck you, recently got back to all time green too lol

I just need it to go up 2 dollars for it not to be a complete fucking loss. Such a shit choice
AWWWWW SHEEEET MAMA CATHIE I WUV YOU!!!!!
It bought a contract that says it can buy GME stock for $55 tomorrow.  It probably did not pay a lot for that contract, but that doesn't matter because we're gambling.  When GME cruises past $60 tomorrow, OP will have tendies.
Who’s planning on YOLOing Joey Big-Bucks $1400 on GME FDs?  🙋‍♂️

Honest to god, is it too late for GME calls? Thinking early Feb Expy but the IV is so high I can just see me getting fucked.

 Greylin Investment Mangement Inc Buys Palantir Technologies Inc\*
Lololol
Along as you set an ourmt and don't count on waiting til they get ITM, then yes.
How would it be a short squeeze event?  How would one even short an OTC?  And the more likely answer is that it is a company focused on a clean hydrogen production method.  Clean energy will be big over the next few years.  Whether, HYSR tech is proven and profitable, I can't say...But it's one of the only plays in clean hydrogen.
She'll probably buy more, but...last part.

What Happened: On Friday, Cathie Wood added 1,025,700 shares of Palantir to ARKW...Palantir represents around 0.50% of the fund's assets, which is the second lowest holding.
How is the income tax rate in the USA? Is it progressive?

I'm giving until covid gets cured and stimulus ends for the bull run to end.
I agree with this. I think the Biden will take a multilateral approach to decreasing Chinese reliance and increase trade with NATO and other emerging market countries. The tariffs and restrictions will be a bargaining chip for Biden.
You need to go back to r/CPTSD

You are still an idiot.
Lmao!!!
Ur rich

TSLA needs to unfuck itself before it gets banned. GME shouldn’t be taking all of its attention. Need 880 tomorrow.
Lol Cramer mentions $bbby, but instead &bby best buy shares jump.
It's not going to fall Monday because...MLK day!

There are also a ton of puts expiring OTM this Friday, which as I understand it, means MMs will unwind their short hedges, which means GAPE 🐻 ASS MONDAY!! 

I mean..Tuesday.
Correct. They also willingly let the market get manipulated, and take no corrective action unless someone with zeros crys foul.

Just another government entity to pay on your way to printing dollars. Every big business knows it.
I’ve been bagholding jt since November lol
It dropped to 1.20 now

This
Ark bought pltr 😳
Thanks for putting it out there, people need to realize that once the mm’s can’t make a profit they will figure out an exit strategy to mitigate as much risk as possible. I can’t imagine Melvin and BofA getting margin called given the size of their assets, but I’m sure they are looking for an exit strategy and if the lending fee, along with the share price, is maintained at these levels they will have no other choice but to pull the trigger for MOASS. Small to mid-size Hedge Fund brokers are stuck between a rock and a hard place and will try to outlast this run, but will continue to be margin called (and possibly wipe out their assets) as the price continues to run.
Considering selling everything for more BB
A man eater and blowjob queen together with me. Yeah

ARKW added 500k shares and PLTR is up nearly 6% AH. I like to imagine in my head they added after listening to your rap.
No. See March.

Why can't the US market be 24/7? Even little kids stay up until at least 1 AM.
IDK if this is the best place to post this but I opened a robinhood account in February, threw in a few bucks, and then forgot about it and somehow managed to turn an $8.50 share into $130.30. I'm addicted now https://imgur.com/undefined
Kind of agree. On the other hand, stock market would have been mooning if Organe man stayed in office. Bcoz that’s the only thing he cared about
I'm debating on putting $5k in BB. This would be my first ever investment? Should I do it?
Stocks or options? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
He said rocket ship emojis. That’s all I need to hear. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
if you have shares it should be good. I am terrible with options so just buy shares.

Wait for biden infrastructure plan

I used to watch his show after school when I was 13 (I know, truly autistic for a 13yo..). Now he's following us.

How the turntables..
I'm worried that the PLTR skyrocket tonight could mess with calls tomorrow. Is that a realistic concern?
Surprisingly, it’s already real
I can hear the margin call already!  Epic Loss Porn to come.  Congrats and Fuk you.
It’s called the NAV. Premiums/discounts do happen but they adjust themselves back relatively quickly.
ARKW
Won’t he need a shit ton of cash to be able to buy that many shares, even with margin?
Like I give a fuck
You’re fucked
gme obviously
So DD on WSB means dumbass doctor? Kidding!

Cool, makes sense. Appreciate you taking time and explaining that, homie. I'm hopping into RH rn...
Just shares. BABA and GME.  If I was going to do leaps now, would probably pick Microsoft which has dipped recently but grows steadily. AMZN tends to grow in fits and spurts and was stuck in the teens which is how I got burned on leaps.

I always want to go long, just not necessarily at this price. For a long entry I plan on holding onto for a bit, I would like to see us head a bit lower. 

Momentum is short for now, so I'll just ride it until that's no longer the case. ;)
Eyyyy lez goooo
Pltr is up 6.5% AH. I don't think it'll get to $30 tmrw tho. Fuck am I saying, of course it will 🚀🚀🚀
You got 6 members now.
You sell when gme is at $60, so the contract is worth $20, $4,000 in total. Congrats!
Congrats. You are up $100 in 6 mos.

Yea anyone can have a good year or two, the ones you read about are the ones who have slightly above average returns year by year decade over decade. 

So don’t beat yourself up if you don’t have 50% gains in one year, that’s largely unsustainable beyond like 4 years due to law of big numbers. Shoot for slow and steady gains and you’ll be rich
Let’s squeeze BB like we did GME, there must be a lot of short interest on BB

lol nice find...it's in the picture I guess.
They did finally cut the dividend once they changed CEO... I think their new CEO actually reads financial reports or something
The AH trading for GME already looks pretty promising
The hilarity of this whole situation really just hit me. Lmao good job everyone 🚀
PLTR gang never left!
Wait... someone bought 480 million dollars worth of 0DTE calls on GME?
Big mind think the same. I also BTFD
Will there be time to get back into PLTR calls tomorrow?
If you had a billion dollars and spent $1,000 a day, it will take you 1 million days or 2,739 years to finish it all. Let that sink in as you struggle to find change for a big mac
yes i caught PLTR right before close
gonna moon

Yeah naturally with the ETF that seems a real long play given the cultural shift still needed to reverse the damage done to MJ/hemp pretty much globally amongst the general population.

That being said it seems a better time than ever to jump on re: market pessimism regarding all the deregulations etc imo
Yeah, of course. Only makes sense for capitalists.
Whats the lockup? I'm retarded someone explain this please
I had 100 shares at average cost of 18.20. Then bought another 30 early today to really ram the point in. Fuck Melvin. /salute

Or just today
Just put on world war Z, last time I watched this we limited up.
Does the squeeze require margin calls on shorts, or just the price of the stock to go so high that shorts have no choice but to exit their position?
So my $30 calls for tomorrow might print more than 3$!!?
Not red now
Honorary seat on the board would be a nice gesture.
Yuh. Been in since early December. Getting tired of the am dumps
but still. Fuck taxes. why they gotta take my tendies
What makes this stock a fraud... they just went thru a name change and the sec investigates that when it happens.. so do tell me how they are a fraud company that just partnered with a fortune 200 company, opened a new subsidiary, had name change become official after passing the investigation needed from the dev for that to take place, hire Allen sossis.. do tell me where the fraud is? If you can ?

Don’t lie to me boys, I made a mistake. I felt kinda edgy one night and bought a NIO leap ($80c Jan 2022), I’m not a communist I just wanted tendies. I just wanna either breakeven or take small profit and get out of this. Down -2.51% already done with it after 3 days.
I just been throwing small amounts from 500-1k at it and expecting to lose it all.

So far its paid off pretty fucking well. Dont panic of it falls 2 or 3 points after you buy, its been doing that shit
your calls are going to 10x from 1 cent to 10 cents! congrats bro!
Brothers BB is de wai 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Is that for all states though?
Yes and behind a screen too.
GME is where it’s at. TSLA is too expensive now
Damn nigga why you scaring me like that thinking she sold?

I Googled it awhile back. She's added a million shares at ~16 I believe.

It's in her arkw fund.
It'll pump up until Feb 14 so don't sell just yet
Fuuuck yeah scrow
Risk for no reason? They don't know you can make money in the markets?

Same dfv hand those calls
Earnings is tomm bud. Stock is on a tear past couple months
Why?
What stocks did you buy? Im gonna guess that you found some sort of up and coming stocks or some stocks that spiked with the Biden election win.

You are technically a first time trader, but seeing as you already put a lot of front end research in with reading multiple books, its hard not to classify you as someone who has atleast some expertise. 

Me personally I've had 60% returns over the past half year, and thats from trading meme stocks picks on here but also looking up stock studies from topics I read about on here as well as Bulkowski's stuff both of which I've been implementing more recently.
omg yasss live laugh love queen 👸
I didn’t even know this existed. I have TD and I just logged in. Looks delayed a bit but not a big deal.

You staying in that? I sold today.
Ban. This guy is so stupid.
AAPL continues to break my balls. My back. And least importantly, my heart.
Wait serious question, do you think GameStop will continue to generate good sales in the future?
Ummm, no. GME at $5 was already ridiculously undervalued. The assumption was they were going down the drain and wouldn't pull off a turnaround. GME at $20-$25 is probably a reasonable valuation for the current state of the business if they were to hold steady. Cohen brings growth potential to the table.
If it’s hit 35$ before 1/29 I will have 300K.
Preach, all the fighting is pathetic. Our ancestors died for our right to disagree, we should show them some respect.
We are all part of this history in making. Thanks to people like you.Congrats Man..BBBY still a buy after the run today?
that's a great question. The answer isn't easy. Whenever you feel comfortable with the profit you've gained, get out. It's fine. Profit is profit. Just know that we're not even close to the ceiling.
Deadass it’s accounts I’ve never seen before pumping BB

And I was top poster last month here by a lot so I was on here a ton

Get your bag fellas but be careful, that stock was a p&d once already
APHA and TLRY =  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Also since I'm a Canadian retard FIRE.TO looking hella parabolic 🚀
Plus they may be acquired. Penn already has a strategic partnership and a stake in TSCRF. That would be an even greater catalyst.
Which means a nice gain.  Fingers crossed.
March or April good?
Stupid easy answer but AAPL. Earnings coming soon, expected strong iPhone 12 sales plus the share price has been beaten down a little this week. Good time to get in or add more

GME squeeze isn't over
Black rock reported better than expected earnings and stock dropped...financials are gonna take a swift kick in the nuts as long as the Fed holds rates down. Good luck. When the pain subsides tomorrow, yolo over into GME
Followed you on twitter. Amazing results. For your options, Are you theta gang? 

Or are you buying naked options or debit spreads ?
I'm talking about when you have to close your short position because your broker is calling it in, not when you open a short sale. You have to return an actual share of the stock to your broker to cover your position, and that share has to come from somewhere.
RIGHT HERE BRO

I'm holding some shares but I was gonna buy some calls tomorrow. Still gonna tho
Because everybody needs to sleep eventually, and nothing sucks more than stonks shitting the bed at 2am for no god damn reason.
That’s what I’m saying!

Maybe OP isnt just gambling with the odds being in favor of him but actually trying to understand whats going on. Its always easy to be an ass on the internet and look down on people, guess what professional traders probably have a good laugh at you daily. Luck is luck, but you cant buy dedication and willpower.

Ill gladly be accepting downvotes from the people of the salt.
Also:

“Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were 45% less likely to be current smokers than patients who had been admitted with other respiratory viral infections the previous year.”
Right, unless you're the market maker.
T mobile is gonna shoot up tomorrow, it’s down considerably the past week but so have most. I think when the market get optimistic tomorrow it’ll shoot back up. 

It fell from 136 to 125 a share. There earnings last quarter were amazing, and they’re leading 5g. Earnings will be released in February then it will really pop.

T-Mobile is becoming the Tesla of cellular companies. It’s winning the 5g race by a long shot. Hell one of these days it wouldn’t surprise me if they overtook spectrum for internet service when 5g is everywhere.

Anyways buy TMUS. Thank me later
It’s difference between short term vs long term capital gains. If held less than a year, you get taxed at federal income tax levels. So marginal rate of 35% for this. LT which means held over a year is 15%. So significant difference. Also need to take into account individual state capital gains taxes on top of it. 

Day trading would obviously mean it’s held less than a year.
Imagine thinking your money is retaining value when the interest rate is anything below 3%
SPCE will rocket
Silver never moves.
True but he said tax those who don’t pay aka bezos. Fuck bezos anyways so let’s keep mooning
Dis is 2 months old
Is it not gonna go up tomorrow? I’m fucked if it doesn’t soon
Damn that was nice!  The hook is stuck in my head now...🎶Not throwin away my calls! Get this man a contract🚀
You could also get a guaranteed 18 percent return on a 3-month CD.
I don’t understand any of this.
It’s almost as if markets are flipping Biden the finger.
Why wouldn’t you at this point I feel like we’ve hit on a lot of stocks recently. Not sure what the history of WSB is but in the past two months I’ve been here almost every DD with 1k+ upvotes has been successful.
Whatchu mean by that? Like you wanna buy calls tomorrow for 1/15? I would buy further out... I'm deep into some 1/15 lotto calls I got for .02 so I'm biased!
🚀 🚀 in for more shares after this
Short it now, total shit stonk, digital games, Covid will be here until 2045 means no in person console testing, short now !!!!!’ 🐻🐻🐻🐻
Wth citi downgraded Pltr plug and nio 😂😂
Right? It's mind boggling considering every 10 posts on reddit for months has been about GME
Made 13k today. Fuck it, selling at market open
Blow up tilray
#OUR TIME HAS COME
But why?
How soon after Biden is commander in chief are we in another war? 
US Navy submarine got busted by Irans Navy earlier today sneaking into their training exercises. A fucking submarine. How crazy, id poop my pants if a submarine came up near me
Yes there is a difference, but as soon as I buy the stock it is a sunk cost. Keep that mentality and you can push through the pain.
u/the_crautist
nah bro, the best weeks we're in the fkg summer bro, and maybe in November when shit like CRSR, GME, PLTR, AND NIO all mooned together everyday basically. That was something.
Interestingly she didn’t buy any at the last dip at around $23, she must be convinced by us
so is clean energy going up tomorrow or nah, after hours haven't done much
Hop on BB
I had this happen, I called them and had them tell me its a bug. Call the trade desk they are very responsive during market hours.

I like what I'm reading so far, but I'm really not good with pharma stocks. What does "an ongoing Phase 2/3 clinical trial" mean in terms of timeline and likelihood of approval? 

Any drug that puts a dent in the negative impact of Alzheimers would be huge.
Honestly, Eurobeat is fucking amazing.
That's not how it works. Low prices lead to higher demand.

Besides, if you would read the article, they're not stopping fishing, they're catching the same fish, the difference is they're taking the catch to Denmark where the prices haven't collapsed due to Brexit's red tape.
I’m holding a shitload of puts
GME
Yeah, but like 10 guys here account for over 90% of the holdings. The vast majority are here for scraps and lols.
Expects me to have the patience to sit on a call for a couple months and see it barely go up everyday... smh. 10 bagger or bust🚀🚀🚀🚀
Since I started trading futures a few weeks ago, options are kinda 😴😴😴, like stocks....basicaly just like how stocks became boring after learning all about trading options. If you think options are volatile... the smallest unit of change, or one tick of the price of one  /VX contract is worth +/- $50. One tick, or "$0.25" change in the price of corn futures is +/- $12.50. Insane leverage. The futures that you guys (...ok we tbh lol) stare at all night has a tick value worth $12.50. So if you were long/short one futures contract and it happened to go up 0.5% that night, your contract would be worth +/- $950. That's why I havent been posting much here lately, but I think FDX calls, or some call debit spreads a month or two out should print. I'm convinced it bottomed out after drilling for like a month straight.

It also feels kinda ridiculous to see SPY above $380. Like 7 months ago it was barely above $300... what a miserable "recession."
Probably citibank buying PLTR after they downgraded it like 2 days ago. Those fucks
Every once in a while I get the notion that I want to sell cars.  BUT - I would be the guy at the dealership going "no, that sounds like you want a Subaru, and not this Volvo". 

I also don't see myself working more than 2-3 days a week or maybe by appointment. 

I can't imagine any dealership wanting to put up with that.   Basically, I want to sell cars so I can sell the right car to the right person. Not so push something into spending more on something they don't need. 

But I still love the idea. 

It's entirely possible that I could work at the local Tesla dealer. We can't sell them in my state, so all I'd do is test drives and information.
What is it about James Cordon that makes people want to shit on him all the time? He hasn't raped anyone, hasn't murdered, hasn't done any thefts, and yet people hate him.

But support support a failed coup d'etat because you wanted to rob a country of what little lithium they had, and all you retards want to suck that person's dick and call him daddy.

Hate the people who try to make you laugh, love the people who support violent revolutions. I bet most of you are conservatives. Makes complete sense.
Well not out of the mmmmmm woods yet. 26 after hours, maybe it will pop tomorrow.
Hold !!!!
Citi downgraded it. Means only one thing to the moon and above.
God damn I was -$800 on these PLTR shares at close. Now ToS says +$1700.
Absolute monster, Congrats and all hail DFV
Safe bet MJ ETF
That would be dope
7.15%
Just found his Youtube.  Roaring Kitty.  Explains it all in great detail.  Makes a shit ton of sense actually.
Oh shit. Totally forgot... yes! The yacht does have a helipad. And a helicopter now that I think of it. I guess I do already have a helipad. 

Nvm. Thanks y’all.
Diversification is for idiots. Look at Buffet’s portfolio, it’s highly concentrated.

Owning a diversified S&P ETF is literally the bare minimum of gains in the market.
I wonder how many short squeezes Cramer causes. I could see a little tear in his eye like he is proud of his retard sin for finally taking his first steps
You’re a GOAT. Keep it up.
ICLN is gonna tank tomorrow. FFFFFF
I've wondered this too, but I just send it and see what happens.
Favorite line. Hahaha.
It dropped 18 points...
That was market close. After hours closed in the 1.60's.
don't know. don't care.
Fuel cell energy is good too and headed in the same direction. Both are good stocks
WNDW
PLTR is in ARKW oh snap
You wont be missed
RDFN PLEAS FLY AGAIN

&#x200B;

EVEN FUCKING SPCE FLEW AGAIN
What good news? That speech was so low energy..I was expecting him to hype up green energy so my ICLN calls print but he just wanted to talk about taxing the rich and hammering down on Wall Street. ICLN going red tomorrow.
Not from a GME paperhander
Lol look at PLTR now
I'll buy
GME squeeze is still tmr.
GME
So why are we investing in BB? I know they use to sell phones. I heard they are in cyber security now or something
After a “major cable network break,” CNBC workers counted “18,000 market orders, all for GME” that they pulled from suitcases and with no SEC observers present.
GME BB PLTR I’ve got em all
you're fked boii
It's not outer strength, but strength of mind to accept those different than ourselves.
"I am not throwing away my stock!"
So I should have closed out my PLTR covered calls at 27.5 is what your saying
BB gang represent!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Thank God, Cathie Wood just bought Palantir shares. Home girl is saving my portfolio left and right this week!
are you kidding me. If I had known he puts in 5 hours of DD every single day and posts it on his youtube channel I would have yolo'd a good portion of my own money too. wow
$GE
Pretty new to this still, would GME be a bad investment? Guessing short means just a buy and sell as soon as it's gone up a bit? 
Is it more of a hold stock or just a bad buy as it's basically a dying market?
But it’s not a joke
To late for pltr
Update: she’s up 6% AH 

https://imgur.com/gallery/d9Ynael
Is that why it jumped more than a dollar AH?
roll emmm
Sounds like 🌈🐻 mentality to me
JPMorgan just downgraded PLUG and FCEL must not have learned what happens when a bank downgrades our stocks. Even the 🌈🐻 are posting articles on seekingalpha shorting FCEL.
The PLTR pump from Woods will then pump ARKK which will in turn pump PLTR which will pump ARKK into an infinite pump continuum
This is the top - of WSB
Goddess Cathie. I will be your personal foot stool.
That is good enough for me!
shoulda bought options way more potential upside
so probably a slow migration for that piece then

Who knows, by the time they start putting their silicon in the Pro series stuff they might have it figured out. They may also be better able to optimize the lower spec stuff since they write all the software that runs the chip.
I'm pissed and probably soon to be fucked
Not exactly no stress, but I really would like to be a mountain guide for extra money and to get outside more.
Shorting GME
I’ve got 1/22 $30c ...... god willing
Lol I went share gang this week
Just keep making money and don't get cocky. Every time I place a large bet after a good run, I get super fucked.
I like BABA, but I’m scared on Chinese companies atm.
Cathie pumping PLTR!!!!
/r/wsb is leaking. But it doesn’t mean you’re wrong.
Mama Cathie takes care of us
Can we ban people who add a ticker and say it's a short squeeze? Like, it's not. GME is. But anything else isn't. Except maybe one of the tickers that starts with a B (BB, BBBY, etc)
Your equity balance is below your margin maintenance requirement. If you don't fix it (by selling securities and/or depositing cash), they'll call your margin by selling off your assets for you.
Ban this idiot
buy the dip before the holiday weekend
Fuck bro. Fucj
Tegridy to the moon
We to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
anyone concerned of spy??? futes dropping and spy drilled today from green to red???
Yes. Learn about options trading before you trade options, or you will lose money, as you can see.
"Your honor, my client pleads guilty"

"WHAT? No I don't!"

"Ooo, sorry, your honor, I meant autistic.  My client pleads autistic"
Agreed, this was the fucking dumbest trade I ever did and it unfortunately paid off and I huffed paint and got full smooth brain
the retard buy high and sell low stratedgy.
On the contrary- the fact that energy is not nationalized is a fucking disgrace
Oh yes, MY shares are what will tip the hat from this going to 100 dollars, I know this sub is full of retards, but that’s next level retarded. People are mass buying calls and instant flipping for profit, nobody wants to be left holding this bag.
yes buy shares or sell retard ber some put
top posts on a certain flavored sub is like twitter, FB lose 51 billion in market value since the ban and everyone in that thread cheering it on like they want it go to go zero lmfao.  everyone there is either poor AF or in HS, not one person knew wtf was going on....  some dude was like "when i heard the news about twitter i shorted it immediately, my puts up 17% already".

i dunno why i subjected myself to that torture.  thanks for coming to my ted talk.
How do you avoid this? My taxes about to fuck me always panic selling and rebuying 😂

Ima throw 2-3k in this tommorrow.  Which is like 15% of my portfolio but ill buy more if it dips.

If you can't handle us at our worst then you don't deserve us at our best
The fuck is happening rn
Futures wrong way
Depends how you look at it. They have many new businesses now (Cloud gaming, Hardware , Ecommerce, Payments,)
Before close?
Going all in on PSTH tomorrow. 100x 45c 1/15
Fuck yes!! 🚀 to the moon
Shit is jumping harder than a Ford Escape with no fucking coils brothers BB is de wai 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Glancing back through some of his "investment thesis" videos in the past. Back on July 13, 2020, $GME made up 1.18% of his portfolio ([https://youtu.be/7wjWnMcdnlQ?t=2963](https://youtu.be/7wjWnMcdnlQ?t=2963)).

His entire investment thesis is about finding underperforming companies that are failing or at least trailing their peers, to see if they can come back (usually a reasonably deep dive into cash flows), management, industry, etc (including technical voodoo). He is the opposite of the meme stock investor, that's probably my favorite part.

Investment Style: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zi7XVudxME&list=PLlsPosngRnZ1ZYcer6iZBVKMt1f8HeW0j](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zi7XVudxME&list=PLlsPosngRnZ1ZYcer6iZBVKMt1f8HeW0j)
PLTR entered the chat

Done with a leap after 3 days lol this is why everyone here is losing money. YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE FUCKING YEAR SHOW SOME DAMN PATIENCE
Get TD ameritrade or something that you can buy stonks on after hours
Dude....fuck yea
Do your own DD retard
Is BB pump for real tmrw?😂
So what are you guys looking to sell your GME stock for? lol
They’re wromg
One of us, one of us, one of us
Rain on Me by Ariana Grande should be the theme song of this subreddit. She was either talking about tendies raining on her or golden showers. Not sure.
Ok Ghandi.
Yo if stock twits can exist so can we. You ever been on that website? It’s complete fucking trash.
tell your dad to do his own fucking research
MY QUEEN
PLTR AH price bump
Someone convince me BB will skyrocket again in the morning. My huge 1/22 10c profit still isn't enough for my greedy ass
Yep, it jumped right after people saw this
first call of my life. BB 1/22 11c. just one contract cuz i'm a pussy, just getting my feet wet tho so you can call me a wet pussy at least
That value is the full margin value amount though.

I did do a $3500 ACH transfer so that would be on margin.

But a margin call for all your margin doesn't make much sense.

Margin Balance is $5532 and Maintenance call is $5509
Y’all getting on the $BB train?
😉
Tuesday big red ?
Which one is lucid
A Friday pump is in order. Could use a happy ending
Done
First ones always free
Yooo  chill I’m just tryna learn from the “experts”
I want to hang framed photos of Cathie Wood and Jim Cramer in my office.
So ETFs aren’t allowed to go up? It’s been down all week.
Sooooooo we pumpin BB tomorrow or what?
PLTR below 30 is still a sad sight :(
Well, I guess we know who's buying first round when we're all millionaires! ;-)
Why are people so hype about PLTR, hasn’t done shit since November
Yoooo how long we we holding/buying GME shares? Lmao I’m down to buy a couple more shares Tomorrow
Got em
This is my first put. Trying to learn the basics still. Is that the bet that gme will be $45 in a week? Do I need the money to buy 100 gme shares? Cuz I don't have that on hand.
Tomorrow will be big red Dick day or ban me
What is done cannot be undone, but at least one can keep it from happening again. Just so you know, the correct spelling is [Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi).

How long could this possibly go on for?
Yep, dumping it tomorrow.  Should moon on Tuesday now.
After a “major cable network break,” CNBC workers counted “18,000 market orders, all for GME” that they pulled from suitcases and with no SEC observers present.
SPY or SPX yolos?
Balls deep in shares doesn’t equal up votes
I don't have to imagine because I AM that retarded

1/15 $55c GME
1/15 $40c GME
Nope, they loaded up around 500k shares today. PLTR 🚀🚀🚀
I’ll make 2.25 mil if it hits 100 tm lmao

Can’t wait for TSM Q1 earnings. They’re going to smash the fuck of estimates
I forgot my busfare, can I ride with you?
Stonks
PLTR finally looking good AH. Let's hope it holds into the open.
Even ignoring the posts, just look the most recent earnings statement and then look at their market cap. DD complete
You thought 2020 was good....2021 to the moonnnnn
Your thread contains zero information about anything at all. In fact, it's such low effort, you're literally asking people how to use the search funtion or Google. THE LOUNGE was created specifically for posts like this. 

Your post is literally 2 sentences. "How do I search for stocks," and "Do you just pick random ones?" The main sub is not the place for posts like this.
BB ?
Yesssss
lolll dude imagine Jones soda goes to $5. Maybe I'll hop on some jones soda stock too lol, I mean what is there to lose?
Puts printing tmrw
Alright here is the play. $ELY. Callaway all the way for the tendies. Do your own research but if not know this, this is your chance.
Should WSB consider this as a Declaration of Independence ?
Sorry. Would like to see other professions ie teachers gain the same notoriety of our troops
That's a huge upgrade from the merrymen
I own a 1987 f-250. Best vehicle I've ever had. Sick commercial too.
His YT is pretty informative actually.  Should give it a watch.  Makes quite a bit of sense.
VIX FUTES BLOOD RED
What’re you holding for BB?
Lmao what? How much squeezing you think is going on here
Holding 30x 22 Jan 2021 $27 calls!
The man has to found a way to bring us back into the fold.  Fuck games stop for fucking me over in my youth.  Thank you Papa C for making it right.
And software, they're pretty undervalued as a well-performing software company because people still think they sell outdated phones.
Make recessions great again
So is CITI the new number one WSB's public enemy? They are shitting on our stocks.
"Emergency"

This is the longest fucking emergency I've ever heard of
So, buy lots of calls for shortly after demo day?
What about his twin brother, Kim Jramer?
🅱️🅱️ flavor of the week. Don't ask questions, just hit buy asap.
I can’t sleep thinking about the gains l, might as well stare at the lil green lines go up in bed for 6 hours
Holy fuck this is great
Us?
Bought 50 shares of $PLTR at $25.09 because everything I see mentioned on here goes up. I don’t even know what the fuck they do
Did joe pump icln
Oh hell yeah I love coinbase I want in
Going fucking *hard* on BB calls tomorrow
Half a million shares 🚀
Run up to demo day 🚀
Demo day 🚀
PLTR 35 EOM 🚀🚀🚀
pump it
That was a typo my bad, meant 81.5 calls
u/savevideo
Yes. IV is too high right now. Just buy shares and hold.
Most of the people on these forums just started in the past year.. we're the current generation 🤣

Come back in 3 - 5 years to see if EVs, PLTR, GME, and crypto worked out
BYND might keep ripping
American stamps are hot atm as after the civil war they will be rare collectables
I've started to shift to small caps now that these are stagnant. I still love these companies but I'm ok with selling a bit because the opportunity cost is too great.
I have watched all my GME bros march into battle while my funds are being held by the CCP. 🇨🇳
Too soon
Balls deep in GME PLTR ICLN, it's gonna like seeing your kids fighting to be the fav kid
It’s finally our time
**Honey, put my bathing toaster back on the shelf! :')**
Rough. I'm in a slightly less painful boat of having sold covered calls on all my shares of ARKK, right before TSLA's popoff from around 700 to 800+. Hoping to roll them up and forward till I eventually capture those gains.
\^
15 @ 39.61, I'm doing my part.
20,000 shares at .20 and I’m not selling anything until earnings are announced. We KNOW they have significant revenue coming it’s just that very few people know about it. On top of this Biden is going dump a shit ton into COVID testing and may even help streamline approval for them to become apart of vaccine rollout.
You know it lol
Meh. It’s nice I guess.
I can’t wait to wake up to my BB calls printing 🚀
I too would like to know?
We are the knights who say NEE!!!!!!!!!!
What?
Did you do a shit ton in December?
Check out his YT - Roaring Kitty.  Explains it pretty well.
I did the same and also bought more, that's why I'm bagholding. I was up 300%, now it's worthless.
Why even ask that here unless you’re just seeking confirmation bias to buy GME?
gg, grats
Nah she doesn’t give a shiet WSB. Because PLTR was announcing some big contracts and new competition yesterday. Also BIG PUT is expired tmr. The downgrade from citipaperbank ain’t coincidence. I THINK NOT.
I'm a simple retard.

I see 3  🚀, I invest.
The meeting tomorrow or whatever
Who tf is Cathie and how does she like her ass ate?!?!?
I threw up looking at this.
Man, if ABNB having a market cap of 100B on 4B in revenue and a net loss isn't a bubble, I don't know what is.

Compare to Expedia which has a market cap of 20B, revenue of 12B, and net income of 500M. 

I think Expedia is going to pop much more than ABNB when vaccines hit.
Same...10k of 128
 Remindme! 74 days ARKX
She bought more today!

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
VALE popping to like $20 would be so awesome. Bought 60 19.5c’s for $.05 each for a YOLO.
My 500 shares in pltr will be happy
Next stop BBBY?
Gonna be just fucking awesome waking up to a port full of worthless calls, I can’t wait...  🤡🔫
Don’t panic
You spelled 1000 eod Friday wrong
To what?
I already went all in on PLTR 1 and a half month ago lol. Best decision ever.
our troops are the only thing keeping the world together
He should donate 5 million worth of stock. It'll be 20 million in 6 months. Lol
The fate of my options account rests with GME 40c
Your efforts are appreciated but this type of post doesn't belong in the main sub and the rules couldn't possibly be any more clear about that.
No, if you currently have a long option contract then it means you're "paired" with someone out there who's short on the contract. Now if you sell the contract to me then I will be "paired" with that someone out there, and you'll be free of any obligations.
Pretty sure he's made a hell of a lot more than that.

This is likely one of his biggest winners, but as of July 13, 2020, it was only 1.18% of his overall portfolio. Meaning, at the time, his portfolio was at least $10m.
Any news or just letting everyone know?
S&P and Vix futures both red 🧐
Cathie can take my babies
Not sure, but what Biden says vs what goes through Congress could definitely be different. I know Dems run the show now, but the razor thin margin in the Senate still means there are no guarantees on anything and making concessions could still very much be necessary.
Same. First thing I'm buying
I’m balls deep in GME right now can you say the same?
1/26
Yeah... not sure if that’s supposed to be .085??
Which ones
TSLA puts
I sold my AMZN shares today.  Wanted to free up some cash. I was holding out for over 3300 again but didn’t see it happening anytime soon.  Cost basis was just under 2500 so i said fuck it.  I honestly felt like i unloaded some bags.  I’ll buy back if Jeffrey decides to split.
New to the gang as of 48 hrs ago and gotta say excited to be here
Fuck why did it dump today?
Green means go so you good
Let’s not forget the merge with PCTI who has had government and military contracts for 29 years.. lol
Are Comac and Xiaomi listed in the US stock exchange? I can't find them anywhere.
Anyone want to go all in on FB

This is a stock that is severely undervalued and the catalyst is earnings in 2 weeks.

Still hoping earnings does something 😞
Then it doesn’t
Yes the 0.83 APHA to TLRY conversion is driving it up. Especially since now Tilray is getting this god of a CEO 🚀🚀🚀🚀⬆️⬆️⬆️💎💎
Why? You are a sophisticated investor who has been investing for over ten years and trade heavily.
I bought 2 $55 1/15 @ .58 today.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
She’s playing with the bears.
PLTR
Lol
It’s not even in ARKK
Stop being a paper handed pussy?
Or we're just getting better.
#👉👀👈
Cathie just bought some today
Loaded on 4/16 20c, 6/18 22c, ready for them to start printing any day now.
>He just ~~sees the growing momentum, the shorts running out of ammo, now today all the boomer news sources pumping gme~~ some way or another acquired advanced knowledge that Ryan Cohen was interested in GME and would purchase a major stake in mid-Jan
When ppl ask DFV how he made it, he can literally say “bc i believed in GameStop when the world didn’t” ...god status
Fuuuuuck
40c and 55c 

🚀🚀🚀🚀
What's an "entry level job" these days? There are companies that try to get away with saying you need a BS in comp sci, know how to handle a LAMP stack, and be a "rockstar" (let us abuse you) for $15 an hour with shit benefits.
Ya know, if you'd ate that pussy good you might not've had one to begin with...
I’m literally trembling with relief 🚀🚀🚀🚀 I bought 3x $25 1/29 PLTR C today at $2 a contract 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Shout out to all the stubborn PLTR bagholders and to Cathie Wood for the rescue.
And EV OS. Two big growing industries
I usually just trade a bunch lol
tomorrow's the big one. 50-60 tomorrow
I think it’s actually incredibly small short interest lol. Either way, to the 🌙 🚀🚀
Not terrible price but u should aim around 3100 to buy in
Hmm maybe a lower strike? That's quite a bit of recovery. I know demand will be back up and its not perfectly priced in yet but its recovered quite a bit already?
uhh have you seen the world lately?
Buy more
There are a lot of benefits to being 1099.   I would appreciate that the government doesn't screw me out of those, along with raising my taxes, lowering my pay, and not giving me stimulus.   1/22 PLTR $35.
Can we ban doomer bear comments? they should just make their own sub
Nope virus talk taking lead. ICLN talk maybe in few weeks
We’re all about shit companies that are about to turn about bigly and run shit again, that’s why
i’m selling everything and going all in arkx when it launches
Also u guys see SRPT? Anyone buy after it crashed? It's been shaking people off all week... anyone have any 1/15 calls you think r gonna print?
$2m in retirement accounts or robinhood? I’m about 1/6 of the way to my number but it’s all in retirement accounts so I don’t know how to get from 43 to 55 yo.
Link?
BBBY let’s pump!!!!!!!!!!
That's the spirit
I would add religion to that...
This is your sign to stop being a pussy and jump in we taking off 🚀🚀🚀
Thats *Her Majesty* Queen Catherine D. Wood ❤❤❤

PLTR  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌜
You act like anything matters anymore. We don’t need news.
This is the way
It’s been pretty good, picked them up at 14 along with BP and shell. European oil major playing oil and renewables yet XOM is the big oil that went up the hardest (waiting to short it)
Sold most of my PLTR on Monday to throw on GME. Sad I am missing the run finally. Still happy for you retards! 🍆🍆🍆
ITM b?
It's an exercise in hindsight in any market.
Anyone got a link to some DD on BBBY?

Thanks in advance
thinking of grabbing leaps myself after tomorrow.
LMAOOOO 😂
Bought 50 pltr shares and 2 $27.5 feb 26 c’s today. Aint getting rich but lookin forward to seeing some greenery tomorrow its been a while
Tendie land
whaaaaaat?
Serious question:

I just opened up RH Gold, should I use margin to maximize this GME squeeze? Never used margin. Sounds riskayyyy
Hail to the King, baby!
Who tf downvoted this
SPWR is the play
I buy more every dip ..🥰 shooting for a tesla after I cash out

So I'm assuming you're spending most of your time at home these days?  
  
Because it would be difficult to travel with those MASSIVE A286 balls of steel
90c boyssss
What’s the Pltr news?
Leap.... 3 days..... yep u belong here. 

Paper hands.
It's okay. We have a printing press. In fact, why do we limit ourselves to 2T if it's not bad? Why not a quadrillion instead? Because it seems like inflation is just a dark fantasy.

People complaining about futures must be new here. Here's a heads up for all you newbie boomers coming here from Cramer. Futures don't matter. At all. Over the last month I have had my worst days after nights of red futures and some absolute shit days with green futures. So put down you scotch pudding and stop yelling at the children riding skateboards down the street and realize that what you've been hearing about futures is BS. Ya fookin' boomah.
Yay me too
TO THE MOON
Yes, definitely. You should test all the pairs. How far back did you go on the 30 min?
What do we think about the upcoming bank ERs?
stocks
Hey thanks
Right now planning on seeing the very quick AM dip and putting it all into the next dollar up calls expiring same day
Wallstreetbets is the place smart people gather when they decide to turn their brains off for the day... :D
Hyper-Parabolic moves, long momentum, spiked volume, Cramer GME segment;
as we move closer to weekends paint a very grim picture for shorts. (VW short squeeze, anyone?)

Very, very deadly.
 Strong men create good forums.

Good forums attract weak men.

Weak men create bad forums.

~~Bad forums attract strong men.~~  Bad forums stay bad forever.
I have shares. Silver is like Frankenstein's monster. I'm fully expecting it to dip back to 18 or 19 again before it really moons to 30+. Or maybe the dip last month to 21.50 was the entry... only time will tell
Clown world, was 2020 not enough of a clue?
Up 6% in afterhours 😳


https://imgur.com/gallery/d9Ynael
That would require shorts, BYND might be a better squeeze
BBBY, 1/29
The scary thing is those calls actually have a chance of actually ending in the money too. If that happens it's only going to teach these retards to keep buying absolutely moronic strikes like that. They'll be guaranteed to do it again and lose it all next time lol.
Yeah I’m a bag holder but it’s up 900% in under a year; just keep buying shares
And sold basically at expiration.

And been parlaying his option plays into just straight up shares.
Best buds.
Everyone raise you hands and give some energy to  ICLN    
It will rise Goku style
That’s good to see. I felt was so similar to the wsbgod fraud that I had my doubts about this whole phenomenon.
Care to elaborate...
Just don’t hold after earnings babe
Short means to basically bet it's going down, very bad idea in almost every scenario but in this case it would literally bankrupt you. GME is a good investment, buy shares and ride this shit to valhalla
I was holding NVDA from 2017 onwards. The sell off in late 2018 and early 2019 was extremely painful and mentally scaring/conditioning when it comes to my investing philosophy. Watching your shares tank 40% in value is an experience I honestly hope every investor will goes through once and only one time. After you go through it you stop caring so much about the intraday swings. This new cohort of investors who have made their money in 2020 need to experience a bear market to teach them some lessons on investing.
This place rules.
Time will $TELL
Well California voters just approved the abuse with prop 22, though at this point specifically limits it to transportation companies. Corps will take that opening and ram their indefatigable wedge into it until the vast majority of folks across industries no longer have unemployment, the right to organize, benefits or workers compensation.  Meanwhile Google just formed its first union last week. 

Always interesting.
He's starting to pull out?
Best description yet.
Early exercise of call options is only rational in certain circumstances, such as when there is a dividend in excess of the extrinsic value of the option, when liquidity is so poor that slippage would exceed the extrinsic, or sometimes to defend early assignment in multileg trades. 

Otherwise just sell to close.
Like most subs, people don't read the rules before posting, then are shocked when their posts are removed.  There are times here that a bunch of posts are submitted before the mod hammer can hit them, and it starts to look like /r/personalfinance.

I like the clean look of this sub.  Way nicer than subs where it's just the same old posts time and time again.
He is a total fraudster. I once attended his virtual course where you could apparently 'ask him questions' and it was exclusive to a very few amount of people. Upon joining, a old video played, no chat box or anything. We were told a q/a would begin after the live video. Than the q/a section was just a creepy video of a robotic voice somewhat sounding like Kiyosaki repeating incomprehensible senses telling you to buy his $100 course on sale for $10000 that will apparently teach you how to get houses for free. Just a conman.
My sell limit order is in for 15 @ $694.20
Me too! We are friends now.
You sold a leap for a loss after 3 days? I've seen paper hands in my day but damn son.
i am not paperhand, but this ship is not going to moon forever, at some point it will go down a bit (especially if GME exercise their option to sell more stock to shore up cash balance)

&#x200B;

so my question to you is when should i take profit so when the ship go down a bit, i can reinvest by buying more GME share with my profit before it goes up again...
BB tomorrow morning?
Facts
Where is it AH??
If you did a ton in December it might fuck you a bit cause it carries into the following year

Look at Biden's website he's not republican. His gun polices are literally that of Hitler, no wonder people like me think he cheated. I think it's very possible Trump as well!! Unbiased people who don't look at full picture make me so confused as to how or why they think like that.
Don’t worry my aapl calls are bleeding too
It might bro it went pretty hard today
Wrong link tho.

This shit is 2 month old, but ARKW did buy 12.5 mil PLTR today. Completely unrelated to the article you posted.

Bye bye bull market. Thanks liver spot.

Guys, I have a confession:

I shit on PLTR for the past 2 days because I missed an exit on my 52 1/15 $25Cs that I bought for $0.50 that was an easy 200%.

(I actually did sell my shares though to play Affirm last night which ended up being the best choice).

I still have those $25Cs.

If this pump lasts into tomorrow, I'm gonna kiss Cathie
i have paper handed twice this week.  ZM calls and wayfair puts on that spike (altho that one no ragrets cuz it was a weekly).  how can i prevent this lameness

I have $5k going into the market tomorrow - where should it go?
PLTR - I've been one of the few to keep  pumping last few days even with the downgrade and people feeling down it. As I said, next 2 weeks will be huge !! 🚀🚀🚀🚀📈🚀📈🚀📈
****just got an email this has all been reversed
wait wtf happened to PLTR after hours lol
Was added to ARK
I think he meant reddit as a whole, but I guess sure, still applies
Futures always cater to Bears, kinda gay
Anyone seeing PLTR go ape shit afterhours?
🤔
Something to do with tech.... I think? I got 9 1/29 contracts and still trying to figure them out.
He is on to us... 

Quickly, We need to replace 🚀 with something else to trick the boomers.
This is either a new low for the sub or an ALL TIME  MOTHERFUCKING HIGH LETS GOOO
So mad I paper handed 18$ shares.
Biden wins election: “BUY BUY BUY”

Biden lays out plan, nothing we didn’t already know he was gonna do:  “SELL SELL SELL”
Yeah holy shit /u/twofor2 I would love to know what state because here in the good ol' miwest sounds like it'll be early-mid summer before most of my family could even be considered for vaccinating.
The market is definitely getting scared before inauguration
Thats the best way to start. I didnt even know what to do when it came time to sell or exercise, so starting small helped me learn.. Then I went full retard
I've decided to hold my 1/29s to expiration.. gonna have to find a few extra bucks from somewhere to pay for the shares
This is why I use an abacus to count my tendies. Can’t trust boomer tech
So much red even vixxx is big fuk red


Fuuuuk
GME director sells 810k shares reducing stake by 64%. Looks like he only cashed out around $25 tho lol.
Don’t use margin on GME because the broker can borrow your shares to short
Good call on SPWR. 20% of today’s volume was bought short
It puts 4M shares out just on that strike. You tell me. I think 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Ditto
In on APHA @ 9.34 each but srsly thinking about buying more at the high rn
I don’t think there’s gon be a crash soon. Maybe correction but that’s it. As long as ppl are just rotating from tech to energy to green to small caps to value, and even to bonds, we good, we’re just juggling liquidity. But if/when ppl sell a shit ton volume of JNJ and boomer ass dividend stonks... look out
Yesterday included intense short covering, I don't know how much of today included that.
Retard. Together. Strongk.
Thank you bro!! Solid info here.
Who’s really gonna sell? Institutions had to buy after it started trading on the market because there was no ipo, just insiders hold shares
This is the way
Are we finally going to see PLTR moon again tomorrow?
Sell for Pltr these fuckers wants to get in
Please don’t sell GME to get into PLTR. That is not the way. Take out a pay day loan if you have to!
Lol on GME- noooo
imagine not being in Steel gang rn
nice, I got $85 calls for 1/22 lol
Somewhere in the ursa major constellation
So since we're being very forthcoming about it, are you guys still pumping GME or BB tomorrow? What's next week, Napster? Dunkaroos?
22nd. IV crush is gonna hurt but they're printing
Damnn
BB and PLTR green
Seriously it should just be a coke fueled orgy that is only open 10 pm to 4 am. Stonks would fucking moon.
Guys, Cathie slapped the bears face. I love her. PLTR to the moon. That downgrade from citipaper bank aint coincidence. I THINK NOT.

What a good week for me. I bought GME at .14, I bought more PLTR calls this morning, and moved 1/2 my portfolio into BB calls at $9
you, sir, are a fucking LEGEND.
Lol its the same!  But 2020 dollars if it makes you feel better.
It kills small businesses though. They'd be better off lowering the taxes some more for lower and middle class and raising for ultrarich.

The meme game on this sub is absolutely fucking unreal. Puts everywhere else to shame. 

I’m actually gonna make an effort to learn more about the autist-focused investing that goes on around here so I can really appreciate this shit fully.
Cathie picked up more pltr today. This is the new price floor. Fucking load up on leaps now dude. Cathie doesn't fuck around, we are going stratospheric
10/10 meme. Arguably the best episode of GoT, top 3 no brainer.
You'll have 6.5 hours tomorrow to do that
Tomorrow is when Melvin has to cover his short position.
So is GME on the WSB mount Rushmore of plays along with AMD and TSLA
Looking at the old comments of people making fun of him is the best
If I knew a I had to do was commit to not throwing away my calls to start the 🚀🚀🚀🚀 I would've done that a week ago. My bad man
PLTR up $2 AH
PUTS have been losing Bears plenty quick the last 9 months

The Twitter short wasn’t a bad play...
Don’t have losses. Or trade in an IRA.

Why were they so high a few years ago and now back to the 10s?
Well you also broke the rule that says links must have a summary in the body of the post, so take your pick.
Biden is gonna downgrade JPMorgan?
y’all can play with gme. i will not go near it with a 20 foot pole
I bought in pretty low with ICLN a couple days ago, I could risk selling at a loss and buying even lower but I’ll probably just hold it for the long play.  Fingers crossed for the next few months?
Same but I feel that pre market drop coming too
Mind sharing your strategy with a n00b?

Can't have peaks without valleys, and vice versa. Hopefully I remember that when I am living on the moon in my Tesla house LOL
Buying the Twitter dip, just fell below 100 day MA which is bought by bulls over and over again.
I own shares too I’m good just made trash money off my options when I could have been balling if I made them a week longer lol. For APHA and TLRY. Apha seems like the play though since it’s trading lower than what you’d expect regarding price to merger value.( not sure the correct term but like how much TLRY you get for APHA).
Yep, I agree... looking back over the years, my biggest investing regrets have always been related to selling, rather than buying or holding too long!
I loved being a barista in a crazy busy shop on a college campus. It was fun for me because the busyness meant the time flew by, and most customers were either students or professors and were kind. It was also not very brain intensive; if I was on bar, I could sort of get into a flow of just making drinks for hours. It was a great counterbalance to studying...
They’re offering extreme anal now
>ELY

Do you think there is steam left?
Yits been...
Doubling my GME position tomorrow. Reckon there will be a dip or set the market order for open?
Isn’t that fucked though?
I'm with you - but it pulls back when it pulls back. I had a safety play overnight knowing this speech could go either way. Things are about to get more real soon. Interesting how a speech that was very focused on stimulus didn't stimulate.
hold dude, cathie bought 500,000 shares, she will be adding
Omg Trump IMPEACHED
I bought in early and took out profits. It it's been red on the buy back in but I believe that it's going to succeed.
I got a cool new flair so what more can you ask for
Saw an investing.com article that said chinas stock markets up because of hopes for U.S. stimulus while the stock market here is down lol
Nothing. Its the way theyre discussing it that I found funny. They know model numbers, feature lists, all this stuff most people dont even think of. It sounds like a bunch of people talking about cars.
Before you leave see who makes the auto check out machine. With $15 minimum wage those are going to be every where.

And it’s big green I’m talon to u Amazon
If you have ITM options for tomorrow and the cash to exercise I highly suggest doing so

Maybe if you wrote the whole word out instead of “tomm” and used some punctuation I’d understand what you’re saying.
GameStop/BB shares
Someone explain I'm stupid
If FB wasn't acting like commies I would've pulled the trigger at 245. How long can it realistically go before bouncing?
If I could rip out my FOMO brain cells, and listen to the retards here in WSB, my overpriced (and now worthless) Tesla calls would have bought me a house with gme
Thats why noone gives a fuck about them
gl friend
*Rug has left the chat*
How dare he assume our ages?! The only qualification here is being a retarded non-🌈🐻
Lesson learned, will only buy hot meme stocks of the day like GME,BB,BBBY considering everything else wants to be red
Ford, not GM, but other than that, yes.
Sold my position after earnings bump today.  Sold at +40% I wanted to take profits but given weed isn’t priority I’m anticipating pullback and I’ll get back in on a dip
Anyone know why W was mooning today
My 1/15 calls are VERY appreciative of it
I wish I understood any of this lol
GME gang has been so silent. Are y'all scared or what is going on
My price target for it is actually above 100, but that is almost an arm and a leg held up for a year to make double my investment. GME has done that in 1 day.
1/26
$BB this is the way
Congrats. Wish i had thrown a few bucks in. But i really didnt see what all the hype was about. It looks like it really is just a meme short seller squeeze. Crazy.
Price target for 1/22 ? I got some calls today

I wish you would have posted this yesterday since it appears to be wise advice. Unfortunately, I am a paper handed bitch and exited my position of when it increased 40%. My realized gain was nothing to sneeze at, but it could have been so much, much more. GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Did you'll get the reversal of that unsettled funds not to use in crypto update about 8pm est? Or only few select got it?
I mean literally this tho. If the money is being used to stimulate the economy, it’s provides a net positive outcome, even if it’s deficit spending. We owe the money to ourselves, after all.  It’s not like this is foreign spending that we owe.

Listen up gay bulls, you pretend to like pussy but you really love it up the ass. Good thing, because you’re about to get widened by a big red Dick tomorrow. Play time is over, I hope you took your gains and stored them somewhere safe, because your calls are about to get FUKD

We got BABA watchers on deck for open here?
❤️
Ban
Gimme a one sentence recap kind sir
they should stress you
Not really. Only 6.2% of shares are shorted right now.
GME. Shorr squeeze just ramping up.
lmao i’m sitting with 23 SPY 385s
WSB Jesus please just pump spy this one time for me and I’ll never do it again 😭❤️
ive got 12k sitting in amazon it needs to do something!
You’ll have time to transfer GME profits to palantir next week
$10mil tomorrow brother...
"Let your winners ride" is one of the MOST difficult lessons to learn. It's important too, 'cause this is how you offset your losers in the long-run. Never hit the "sell" button. INSTEAD use loose trailing stops! I know it's really hard when you're holding a 5-bagger or 10-bagger and you want that profit locked in and realized (and liquid again). I get it. So if it's liquidity you REALLY need, then just shave off a little of your position. That should do.
You lack vision. Dream my brother!
Get in on GME now and set a stop loss 20% down just in case.
Big red everything = GME & BB fly on retard strength
WSB to earn 51% of GME in the future????
He is bathing in 10k demo money, indeed he will never lose 😉
Which one? Im in
You can read Scion's quarterly 13Fs, although you'll be a few months behind Burry.
Meant a lot more a few months ago when we were at 2200 then it does now at 3800
Prettt sure everyone is
We went down like .32 %
Anyone know when the PLTR offering closes
As someone who is new to wallstreet bets and who does not day trade how should I perform my daily routines on here? Like is there an introduction to WSB? 

PS: I live in Japan serving overseas so I do not day trade and all my trades are after-hours or next day schedules.
Big big pp that guy has
God Dam if Anne Hathaway, pussy don't look and smell like a flower then call me a gay bear cause gawd dam she is a fine woman..
Try getting through tomorrow first, Nostradamus
Cathie bought 500k shares 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I think PLTR just got back on the map after being a “has been” meme stock. Now cathie wood added shares of it to ARKW so you should def hold it for longer 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Stimulus money pump GME over $9000
Thank you for saying what I've been thinking for 2 weeks.
old ass joke put some respek on her name
I've been hearing were holding and I've been waiting on more info to figure out what to do.
Someone’s gotta start a petition to get him on the board of directors.
Why?  So your $1,000 in cash effectively becomes worth $500 over the course of his first 100 days..?
Finally joined the party today with 12 at $37 fucking moments before it hopped up to 39. Ngl I am worried I'm in too close to the top, but I want to believe... Let's fucking Go!

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
That's some real class warfare level proposals there... Small business owners aren't going to be happy with $15./hr, landlords won't be happy with eviction moratoriums..and businesses won't be happy with extension and increase of unemployment benefits...  Getting ready for a fight in congress.... Well at least you can tell Biden is at least helping the common man.
Are you counting the 100k shares he'd own if he exercises the contracts (lol)?
Agreed! I got in at 76 and some 82 calls 2/15 yeeeeeeeeeee
My thoughts exactly. Boomer boost tomorrow. Well done my slow gents, well done.
Nah.. makes sense, wasn’t contesting that. 👍
So PJ traders have it sitting pretty flat, but watch the global markets pull it up in a few hours.  Joe just told the whole world that America is going to participate in the global economy again.

Except for GME it would seem. WSB about to have one hell of a year
Earning will be huge, its the noise that is keeping it low
I would love some 18% cd ladders!!!!
That big red candle on /ES was just after the Japan session open - I wonder if it was someone liquidating.

Cathie bought shitloads 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Lmao right
Yea, cuz you’re thinking the stocks they don’t think are any good- they buy small positions. Interesting strategy, Cathie...
why is wayfair even alive
Oh you bet your ass I’m hoping in
What do you think he's doing right now?
When did he sell those Jan 15 calls?
275
It's undervalued. Top Golf is one of the many assets it holds. But mostly because it is undervalued. Expect $80-$100 by the end of the year.
Buy the pltr hype
I'm a noob at calls. Can you maybe explain to me what happened, or better yet, how I interpret the photo? Please!
Trump impeached wtfffff
Lmao who were the fucktards that tried to ouster mama Cathy. They're probably the only thing I'd short in this market. In 5 years she will cement her position as GOAT.
Rent too damn night club member checking in
You mean IMMANGOED?

Love it yo!!!
right? What an asshole
Fucking hell. I bought a 1/15 26C on Monday for .27 and thought meh $27. Sold at 2.7 on that first $2 pullback yesterday smdh.
Look up CHWY's valuation and then look at WOOF. Minimally WOOF is a 2x from its current spot.
There was a decent survey sequence done some weeks ago, and it amounted to some 5 million shares.
Oh RH fixed the unsettled cash cryptocurrency thing.  Somehow that’s even more unsettling.
Any way to see BB now?
**Alexa, play "Time for Me to Fly" by PLTR Speedwagon**
Whats everyones exit strat for SENS
stocks 80% of time dump after earnings
To you too. 3780ish is the highest point I'd consider buying btw.
Across all accounts. I'm lucky that in Canada my retirement accounts can be accessed whenever, don't know how it works in the US. /r/financialindependence is a great sub though if you don't already know.
Can you imagine had you spent that on options?? Triple those 🚀🚀🚀
Is there a way to see how many DJX contracts were traded today?

Vs SPX
🦾🦾🦾
Lol, this is funny
Hey thanks
This week in particular has been really slow. If you’re not trading any of the GBP pairs then you’ve pretty much been trading a ranging market.
That could dramatically impact competitive advantage, and thus revenue.
You’re probably too young to use that app sorry think it’s 18
But premarket opens before 9. Nothing opens at 9
r/conservative is calling for the death of Twitter. And Facebook. And Amazon. And Reddit. And...
That stock really sucks. So disappointing
Yes please...you know any more on NIO?
Isn't there an update tomorrow?
Kind sir would you consider channelling your big dong chakra to PLTR?
Strap on your helmets, tards!!! We going to the Pluto!

Yeah $20 average
Buy STIC instead
They designed it, they dont actually manufacture it. Thats TSM
hope you saved enough money for some honey mussy
Did you include a lil sprinkle of computer vision to scan the gifs for tickers too though? That’s where the money’s at. I’d definitely be interested to know how well GME and TSLA stack up on that metric.

dafuq are you planning on doing? thats easily 200k a year ffs
I don't think reddit is fundamentally different, but I do think it's better. The problems with social media are matters of degree and reddit isn't as bad. In my experience, anyway. Peoplenin subreddits fullnof conspiracy bollocks might find it even worse for them than facebook?

To be more specific: I've had much higher quality conversations on reddit than on facebook and I regularly end up reading academic articles as a reault of my resdit browsing. I think I've only ended up reading a good quality article because of facebook twice agter years of fairly heavy use - with reddit I think it happens weekly.

In fact, most of the academic reading I've done that hasn't been directly related to my thesis has been because of reddit. Obviously I'm limited to only my experience, others will have quite different relationships  with reddit and facebook. In my case reddit is less harmful than facebook by a fair margin :)
Wondering the same. Got some and sold before latest dip. Still monitoring closely.
BABA gunna moon in HK 🚀

What do you mean by a lot of shorts come up in June and July? As in, the shorts will buy to close their positions at that point?
What happened
I literally can’t read this

Ok Melvin
Nope...

Bought some BBBY calls today !! They will go to the 🌝
Why!?
I don't know man, I thought my positions were safe but now I'm a little worried. I should not have went balls deep in this bitch without protection
If I made 7m on stocks, I'd take 1-2 million and only use that for any future stock market bets, and bank the rest permanently. If I zero out the 1-2 million, no big deal. If I make more, bank a portion and keep going.
Bought a call on BB June 15 strike i think I'm happy
What energy penny stocks are you holding onto for the Biden pump?

Yeah I think long term AMD will have to adapt to survive. There's a rumor going around that they're already working on an ARM chip to compete with the M1. 

I really like AMD's CEO - I have faith.
I think we will open at 380. DXY usually rises when spy drops and stays down for a couple of days. Today spy and DXY cratered so lets see what tomorrow brings.
Can something be so retarded that it becomes smart?
CATHIE GONNA BUY PSTH ONCE ITS STRIPE. BET. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Woah, I didn't know he had a youtube channel!!
I know it will hit it’s not about losing the investment it’s about how long that initial investment will be locked up when it can be used in other short term plays.
Ya I’m sure Cathie Woods just added it for the memes 🤣
For anyone interested or confused on BB- tomorrow they’re having an investors conference! Here is the presentation https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/2020/analyst-summit/analyst-summit-2020-presentation.pdf

A whole 2.5% though lol.
Can’t believe Johnny Karate let a homeless, mentally ill war vet take over his dojo smfh
I've lost every penny I've ever put into the stock market. I will never ever give up on my dream of becoming financially independent from stock and option trading.
I have posted this same message multiple times over the last few weeks/months. Set your limit sell, walk the fuck away.
$15/hr minimum wage will result in fewer jobs. All that will happen is that a lot of jobs won't get done because they are not worth $15/hr. 

$18/hr seems very low for a software developer, he should look for something else.
Please someone create the WSB Mount Rushmore with these people. Who is the 4th? Sue Bae?

Says the guy yoloing money into stocks he doesn’t understand technicals of. It’s literally been researched thousands of times. Price increases of goods does not come anywhere close to the gained monetary value of each person. Like I said, I don’t agree a base minimum wage is the best way to go about it, but government subsidies go a long way
tsla flight first, then aapl next
Don't puss out if this happens.
DFV only pumps all of our wives and moms and dads. Never dumps them.
That my day to day happiness doesn’t all of a sudden explode because I magically crossed some number I had in mind , it happened over and over and I pretty much feel the same day to day , I used to obsess over growing my net worth and now I focus more on living my life and I am much happier , specially after how 2020 went for a lot of people
RemindMe! 45 days
VIX futures are red too man chill the fuck out
This is the way 🙏

Yes, I'm absolutely shaking of fear after it went up to $42 AM and it basically at its ATH.

Interesting, I had never heard of it. I’ll likely need it in less than 5 years though so I guess that won’t work me.
He should be a board member at this point
slightly red futures. means we going moon green tomorrow
If you have the money to exercise is there any reason why you wouldn’t if you think it’s going to continue to moon? I’m holding 3/19 $10 calls and come March I may actually want the shares
VALE broke its ATH in AH.
I have nothing better to do at the moment

Wasn’t the recall because the screen issue?
Cunt I knew I should of bought fedex the other day
I was wondering wtf was going on
more shorts to thrash
I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt here and assume you’re laying down some heavy /s. In which case my non /s reply is simply...no. Do not short gme right now.
Gotcha - that would make a lot more sense. When the actual squeeze starts this thing is going to be wild.
>I think it’s always good to mentally prepare for a dip when you’re diamond handing a moon shot. But given the current momentum, I strongly doubt any massive dip tomorrow especially with so many worthless puts expiring.

What sources provide net open short interest information?
I was one of the PLTR peeps who lost money so I am soured on trying them again.
🦍together strong
Buy gme calls
235 fill the gap
This is so fun!
Listen up, if you mf’s sell GME I’ll take your asshole with no Vaseline.

Triple digits easily
That's actually a very good point, it would create distance between the admin if the next election ends up projecting to be close.
I held PLTR 25 puts and sold for a loss literally 5 minutes before it dropped into the 24.xx I had to get the cash back for GME calls though and made 600 off a 55c 1/15 intraday
Welcome to the rabbit hole.

r/options has a wiki for beginners.
I got 10 $15 calls for 9/17 a few weeks ago at $0.40. Fuckin’ tendietown!
Ark just bought 500k

Now, Biden said on the campaign that he intends to sign an exec ord on day 1 to reenter Paris climate agreement. That alone is going to cause some tendies.

Wrong. Post med school will give him more tokens to play the game.
Ah yes ICLN went up AH just so it can give it all back in the morning
It’s only ever been above 30 for a cup of coffee
nah it looks like a number 2 at arby’s
yup, but life is fucked, so what can you do
Use spreads
Bear?
I would start with getting an app. I use Stockpile, but I think Robinhood is better. And I just invest in anything that I know and what I think will go big. Right now my best are NIO and AMD, but I also like to invest chunks of money into big companies (Amazon, apple, Microsoft, etc) just to earn easy money. The apps make it really easy to see your progress and they are easy to use so just start there, you got it! (I’m a 17 year old girl and started when I was like 15 so I know exactly where you’re at!)
I work at a nuke plant and I do not advise this
In with one $6.5C 1/29
Wtf were we doing before then
Sell. GME won't stay still for long.
I fully agree. Elon Musk would be so proud.
Fuck yeah!
Bro that’s old news. Still needs to go through senate
This dude managed to be a market maker with $100k.

Fucking. Legend.
And just like that thousands of children’s university funds are destined to be vanquished from existence.

Question. Do my options remain the same value after hours? I’m holding an options on a stock that has gone up after hours, but I don’t see the change in my contract only in the after hours market indicator on the actual stock. 
If so, I’m guessing tomorrow morning it should go up in value right?
Gamblers fallacy is a myth. Every option has a 50% chance of tendis

Dude It’s at its 200day. Technically speaking which means shit but If it slips again it might just keep going. Plus a few country’s are now banning them from banning users 😬
Biden said green energy a few times. My PLUG calls saved?
Cost basis was around $3/share, yeah.
It needs to go up for sure, but I'd rather see a phased approach.  Or fix it then tie it to CPI.  Or something a little less brain dead than leaving it to political gridlock so that it doesn't move for 12yrs

doomers gunna doom

stocks however, they’re just gunna go up
Plus if it was anything like my experience, it meant free coffee. In college, that saved me so much money..
Pretty sure GME just stole every last cent from the rich through robinhood
Futures already making a comeback bruh, stfu bout it. 

In other news, BBBY MOONING TMR 🚀
And it's technically forum-like, not social media lol
GME headquarters never responds, lol trust me I’ve contacted them twice in the last few years. 

Cramer isn’t asking to directly let them off....that would be an indirect result, but for GME to fully transition to eCommerce.

RC and Sherman know better than that though. They’d lose ton of future investors and customers by pulling that kind of move. Plus if I was in their positions, I would enjoy the thought of knowing shady firms are getting screwed and wanted my the company to go bankrupt...

Would be the kind of thoughts I’d have in my head when I’m banging my wife so I could finish faster.
Let’s get Cramer cancelled for going full retard live on air lol
doesnt show the price target of 100....
How those puts holding out?
That doesn't sound like something a teen or child would do.
I mean, I’m half mast from that vid alone
Heretic
I don't even want to know where you got them.
This might print, im holding shares for you beo 💎🙌🏼

Depends on the strike? With Cathie buying a shit ton of it today, it might break out tomorrow morning if we have enough volume. We could see something like 94? A full breakout would really be extraordinary, but improbable.

This is what I’m hoping. At least I have a a lot of Cathie ARK to back me up
Yo for the past 2 1/2 years I’ve been here I’ve never seen wsb be so fucking right in such a big way so many fucking times in a row
After this last stimulus announcement we will have the stimulus talks going well pumps but then what? Just high unemployment, low interest fights that off, and a high valued market. 

We might get into a boring market. I fucking hope so. Y’all tards have every fucking theta up so high it’s hard to make money even when you are right.
What is your trading style?  Which filters you use will depend heavily on that.
I mean I have 17 calls that are now worth $36k but even I feel greedy holding through today. I tried to sell a few today but the buy price never hit.
Thanks, I meant a mutual fund that tracks an index.
Have a 1/2022 130c so less stress. If that doesn’t hit, we’ve got bigger problems.
You can’t trust a man who dyes his hair...
You can only be on one team, Team PLTR or Team Bonzi

PLTR or ARK stonks for them Cathie gains? Or both?
Yes

Please do more..
True but this is oversold now and earnings beat will make this moon imo
It stays the same it was at close
I'd say this is simply a correction after being suppressed by the shorts; not that it's inflated. Several users here have posted financials to back that claim up.
Does he have an angle for a Xbox X already? WTF I can't find one under $999....
Same question. Received $1217 under first stimulus (based on 2019 income).  Then changed bank accounts due to fraud (thanks wifey).  Didn't receive second stimulus payment like all of us here.  I understand that I might have to claim on my taxes. But my 2020 income was larger, and every calculator I'm seeing shows zero money.

2019 AGI: $193,650

2020 AGI: $199,000 (pending)

Married filing jointly. 2 kids under 17.

I checked my tax transcript but it's not clear. I see the the $1217 first stimulus, but a bunch of weird refund/credit lines around that time.  Then, on Janu 4, 2021, it shows a $217 tax relief.  Was that the payment that my previous bank rejected?  Should I have received that $217 bawd on my 2019 income?  And will I now miss out because my 2020 income is higher?

Please help. Need to know how mad to be at my wife for losing her purse.

Thanks!
Me too, me too.
BBBY or GM
Futures? You think these idiots can predict the future?
Who knows with the way this market has been. I can see $40-$60 being a reality.
High quality information like dog shit/chicken exit path/ gecko DDs
The world is more evil than i thought.
The reason is tendies. You can tell the writer of this found wsb yesterday after hearing about it somewhere else.
Aw
Only if you hate money.
Came to this after Jim Cramer
I should have bought WOOF shares. This thing is going to $100 within the year probably.
You bought a stock and evaluated it after 4 days.

Do me a favor. Repeat your strategie 10 times with the demo account. And let us know the result.

Just want to show you that you won’t hit 10 out of 10.
God damn I love Cathie Wood

I believe Caitlin may be our only ally in the belly of the beast known as WSJ. Her most recent hits include titles like: 

"Robinhooders Want More Female Investors"

"TikTok and Discord Are the New Wall Street Trading Desks"

And the classic "What is Margin Investing?" because she knows her audience.

I'm sorry, but this move is more than we have seen in recent days in that short of a span. We have been chopping sideways 5-10 point swings.
This confirms my bias 🚀🚀🚀🚀

VIX 💀
You know how you can tell if someone has only been trading since October?

They call it a "rug pull" when the VIX is down...
If this hits $55 tomorrow I might shit my pants.
Same here, although a decade or two earlier.

Excellent job.
I got it off the gate at 27.91, hoping for it to get to chewy price range
45 seems reasonable
The farther OTM an option is, the more money it makes moving closer to ITM.

The closer the expiry, the more money it makes as it moves closer to ITM.

Take profits from a conservative leap that printed early and roll them into a closer expiry or a farther OTM or both. 

Its definitely an increase in risk in exchange for a larger profit %.
JPow likes W
Fuck me it worked 

Pltr is up almost 7% AH
It means your first thought would be to read a PR relating to the merger... Depending on what it states, after the dust settles you either get Google shares, cash, or mix of both.

$PLTR to the moon (until it crashes again 2 days later, as per usual) .
Yeah I actually did that before I ever bought/sold my first futures contract. I pretty much only traded /ES options and didnt touch oil or anything else. Dont care for them, theta is a bitch. I much rather just trade futures normally and trade options on stocks
Time In the market beats timing the market.
Played ES calls off that bounce
What time is Joe Biden talking?

I don't know options. Slightly confuses me personally; I can't make smart decisions heh.

Can I ask what vehicle you will use to day trade crypto?
Hey thanks
I think some of the people here can answer this. How on Earth did Axios suddenly become a force in journalism. Out of the blue they got HBO deal. Interviewed Trump and have been interviewing high profile players in the Hill. Who are they actually? Their scoops are on par with nyt,wapo.
Do you asswipes think my plays  r fuk? Gme 48c???
He borrowed shares and sold them at $15 (naked short) and promised the borrowers he will give them back their GME shares on 1/15 (tomorrow).

What just happened with PLTR after hours?
Same situation and location. I go to bed 1800-1900 wake up 0030 then do the thing til close which is when the chow hall opens up.
Not DD
I think we found Enron Musk aka Trevor Milton! I thought you weren’t allowed to post publicly about Nikola anymore.
hmmm interesting. could be the next squeeze 💦💦
Never heard of it. But, I’m feeling the urge to drop my IQ, so here I go...
I wonder what the next stock pick will be
“People” you mean this fucking pump and dump autist sub
Dang... u sound smart
Nice attempt at a pump n dump
future don't matter when  you are 100% in PLTR
100 shares is $900. But 10 contracts at .90 each is 1000 shares for $900. So much more profit/loss potential for the same price for those who are lower on capital
PLTR
ARK just bought almost 500k
Ha don’t speak so soon. We’ll be right until we aren’t

Bed Bath and Beyond the moon!!!
RH is pushing Cr**to hard. I’d be interested to see they’re monetizing those trades.
He seems to imply that WSB planned this short squeeze. Is the true? I mean, I know people have been talking about GME for months but I haven’t heard anything about a short squeeze. Just DD about new management and shit like that.
sometimes people just get lucky
I hope it never changes. Eventually it will get pussified and Reddit will start censoring us and bringing in more and more faggitry.
I not only miss them but catch everything right before they drop. Even if it’s down 10% and i go in... it manages to go lower.
Possibly it more likely it should go up since it’s down big
I doubt he will live much longer if his short position keeps getting bum rushed.
Thanks!
Cathie Wood just bought PLTR you know what that means 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Husband's boyfriend obviously
What she do now?
GME gang member here... Scared of what? This is just the beginning my friend.
Id GME hits 50 this week or ever?

Weirdest part was when Biden was like “now look, I’m not the type to grab a woman by the genitals as our former president might have! But I must admit..... congresswoman Alexandria “AOC” Cortez is one of the finest pieces of bosom and rear to enter the legislation since back when Marilyn Monroe gave JFK the little sucky ducky! Bravo Ms. Cortez! I hope to be seeing a lot more of you!”
Topships?
I got burned by WSB DD once before, ever since then I've watched and quadruple checked every play/post/sentiment like a hawk to ensure it doesn't happen again so yeah good to be skeptical.

Congratulations, it’s all a journey anyway.  I’m mostly a buy and hold long term investor but I occasionally trade options, I’m not a day trader and I only go for small positions just for fun.  Personally I like occasionally trading,  it’s definitely more exciting

Okay, I've been on this sub long enough. After I've made gains on GME.

I will NOT lose everything on the next meme stock.

Then I WILL buy the following trend.

It all makes sense now. The reason we're not all money printers is because we make it big one stock, and then completely eat the shit the next stock.
No dip. I reckon stagnates after monday until some news from Cohen and co.

Options prices only update during regular market hours.
150k i believe
645 PH of S19’s at 4¢ power is about $180k a day after expenses. That’s  $5.4m a month. With a market cap of $500m that’s 100 months or about _8 years_ of mining. BUT network hashrate will increase within about 3 months. Within 6 months these will barely be profitable.

Please be careful with miners. It’s a commodity business and their margins collapse to 0 very quickly.
Not for nothing, but I made 25% in two days out of CCIV and LEU. I got the idea here and did my own diligence on them. There are some very sound investment ideas here that you can run with.

OZSC is going to be a big deal and I'm long on it. 

**Ozop Energy Solutions** invents, designs, develops, manufactures, and distributes ultra-high power chargers, inverters, and power supplies for a wide variety of applications. OZSC serves as a provider of assets and infrastructure needed for **clean energy.**

OZSC is aiming to be a **global leader of supply chain solutions within the renewable energy market** as its consumers are using more watts than ever before.

**On June 29, 2020**, OZSC acquired Power Conversion Technologies (PCTI) and changed its name from Ozop Surgical Corp to Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc. in order to reflect the pivot and strategic change from innovative surgical technologies to enter the **exploding energy storage market.**

For the past 29 years, PCTI, or Power Conversion Technologies, has specialized in power semiconductor analysis and application, digital signal processor control, and thermal exchange – **necessary innovations for the renewable energy market.**

**On January 7, 2021**, Ozop announced the formation of a new subsidiary, **Ozop Energy Systems, Inc**. Ozop Energy Systems will address customer project demand streams through **an online catalogue portal (****ozopenergy.com****)** or directly with procurement specialists by working with suppliers around the world. The website is under construction, but they will be launching it in the coming months to host WESCO's supplier's products (see below).

Whether it be an EV station or an entire municipal storage grid, **Ozop will be a key resource of top-quality products** via the network of premier manufacturing partners.

**On January 12, 2021**, Ozop announced a **Master Supply Agreement with WESCO International**, Inc. (NYSE: WCC), a Fortune 500 (379) company generating $8.4 billion in 2019 with **30,000 suppliers and 70,000 customers** worldwide. This agreement allows Ozop, via Ozop Energy Systems, to access premier manufacturers as a key source of top-quality products and solutions. Over the past few months, WESCO has **compiled their renewable manufacturers and all of the products they sell into one catalogue for Ozop to sell via the online portal.**

Customers (more detail at **pcti.com/pcti-customers**):

o **US Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines**: Converters, Battery Chargers, Power Supply, Inverters, Circuitry

o **Eaton, Exelon, Georgia Power, Mitsubishi**: Circuit Breaker Testing Equipment

o **Ford, Caterpillar**: Overhead Cranes

o **General Motors**: Coating Systems

o **NASA**: Ground Power for Space Shuttle Payloads

Good luck everyone, and don't forget: DIAMOND HANDS!

This is the argument for a balanced margin portfolio. It gives some assurance that even if things do tank, you still have dry powder to buy at lower prices. Well, for me anyway. It’s what keeps me invested and able to catch moves to the upside even when I’m more worried about the downside.

Well, the premium may have rose more, but let’s look at the break evens. Break even for the $10C is $11.68, break even for the $15 is $15.98

Assuming it goes to $30 by expiry, the $10C makes more profit [profit = (stock price - break even) * 100] so it’s better to buy the $10C over the $15C

The Trump administration on Thursday added nine Chinese firms to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies, including planemaker Comac and mobile phone maker Xiaomi, according to a document seen by Reuters.

U.S. State Department senior official Keith Krach says Thursday's addition of 9 companies to the DOD list likely to be the last such designation by the Trump administration.

I wouldn't really try to diversify 5k.  I would focus on one company till you have about 100 shares of it and then buy a second company and try to get 100 shares of it. Of course if it's at good value. Companies like o will be around while you accumulate 100 shares of it.

Yes brozzeretard dis is de wai 🚀🚀🚀🚀

If there are huge amounts of highly OTM calls which expire tomorrow, doesn't it make more sense for MMs to pin the price down (say below 40) to make sure all of these calls expire worthless?

I didn’t have the conviction that others had, reason why I sold $21c’s. Seeing this move and dd predictions playing out, the gambling side of me came out and I’m convinced this is headed to the moon. My csp’s i sold where deep ITM. $44 and $46 expiring tomorrow. I wish I knew how to see what the current short interest is as of today not 12/31. If it is still what people are are saying, I can’t even imagine how high this can go. If it goes south sooner than later, at least i had the cc i sold. Right now, im looking at it as insurance. If I closed it now and locked in the loss, id be 100% long.
My god i love this group. Thank you, fellow autists

Yes, way before
Wake up in the morning and consider never posting here ever again.
yeah us. But the 40 strike shouldn't count because it was there before. But we probably did buy 500 000 000$ of calls if we look at all the expiries and not today. We're double counting some as well because people bought and sold on the same day in some instances. 

But yes, its an astounding number of calls purchased in one day.

Buckle up. $55 by close is a real possibility.
You’re not much of a fool tbh. This is one of the most benign ways to fuck up with options. You went long and guessed wrong so you lost your investment, or most of it.

I understand and respect your need for more information on a plan, those details are out there. This DD is a simple example of the big picture. Ryan Cohen, of Chewy fame, laid out a plan to the board at GME. He then acquired even more shares, to make sure he and his team would secure seats on the board to implement the plan. The short squeeze along with the turnaround plan are what jumped GME from $20 to $40 in 2 days. Take a look at the guy who had conviction around this plan from over a year ago. Read some of his old DD for reference. Michael Burry was also in early on GME.

This is a stock with a market cap of 83MM that just took a loan for 140MM to survive. Just curious why else do you think it's a good trade? Or is this just pure speculative play?

I jus want to say I’ve been following this stock closely since the beginning of December and am in for 20,000 shares. There is going to be consistent news coming out as they release new numbers and their testing capacity grows. I’ve sat in on their investor meetings and if I remember correctly they only need to do 5 tests a day to break even on a test site and they are averaging 70+ tests a day per site. They are also pivoting to be a big player in vaccine rollout and the government is practically going to write a blank check to get that done here soon. On top of all this they only have a fraction of the total sites completed and are getting better and better at rolling them out.

Again I’ve been following this since December and the volume has been consistently low. There isn’t many eyes on it right now and I can only see it going up in the near term especially as more people hear about it and see the numbers. On that note, they’ve officially completed their name change and are putting out updates via email and Twitter under the new name.

I’ve thrown half my portfolio at this stock. Do your own DD and make the decision for yourself but out of all the positions I’m in right now this is the least risky and, to me, nearly guaranteed to go up once more eyes are on it.
Yeah, ok.  Go look at the last several times GME spiked.  Notice a pattern?

in the meantime, some random shit companies that don't actually make anything except advert dollars and marketing tools are flying high. It's a much more valuable stock than it is currently. Once a government or NGO buys into something, they're not going to let it go. Too expensive to scrap it.

The only way capitalism ends is with severe wealth consolidation. This isn’t an arguable matter... it’s fact. I wish Americans would wake up to the fact that they are digging their graves under the promise of a future they’ll never see.
I actually have a theory I want to test with this, but it would take a lot of work. Basically we need an formula that tells us if heavily memed stocks here have a positive return percentage. We'd have to search through millions of posts though.
This is the way.
That minimum wage call is going to spook the market if it passes
Because there are 100 shares in an option. It’s Qty * Last Price * 100
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work. And it’s much tendies!!!

Please sell :( I'm scared for you that something will go horribly wrong.
Holy fuck this might be the greatest post I have ever seen, both genius and ridiculously autistic
Depends on the stock and it should tell you that... if you have to ask, don’t use margin
can someone help me with an example? If I have 5000 and buy $7500 worth of stock on margin (interactive brokers) im using $5000 my money $2500 margin, how much do i have to maintain in my account to not be liquidated? im with interactive brokers and just want to learn before making a trade
The UFO space ETF did pretty well this past year. I dunno about first year performance but longterm growth shows a lot of potential.

How badly is theta decay gonna wreck the 1/15 calls tomorrow? I am guessing it would be best to close right after open? Thoughts and advice pls
Just jumped in with another $5k. Not going to lie I bought a 50C 1/15 scratch because I was feeling cheeky.
Best Buy
Yes
#ontheroadto1million
Little late but wow gme ah
If you are in doubt, don’t fully commit. If you are for example planning on investing 5K in it. Start with 1500 or 2000, and keep some some ammo for when it comes down. If it doesn’t come down, you are making profit.
You can still decide to buy more at a higher price, or wait for a dip, or just invest in something else.
Not to mention the S&P500 still has very high PE ratios compared to the historical average, which increases the risk of buying in now compared to other times.

I fucking love hate you so much. I missed my entry at $12-14 cause I was busy picking up weeklies that expired worthless in the end. Guh
Okay so we are all buying GME and BB calls tomorrow right?
one other tip. don't spend money. live like a student as long as you can. I'm several decades into life now and I still live like a student. It makes more of a difference than anything you invest in. Eat cheap healthy home-made stuff like beans, veg, rice, oats. Cars, booze, ciggies, eating out, haircuts vs buzzcuts, none of it is worth it. gl

> I'd still have the actual stocks that I could wait out for it to go back up if it ever does.

Since this fund sells covered calls, I wouldn't bet on it coming back up quickly after a possible crash. 

>If it lasts 12 years without tanking

Highly unlikely. On average market tanks every 2-3 years.

Eh
I'm an economist, I fully understand the mechanisms of monetary and fiscal policy.

I am not against stimulus, but there are better ways of going about it. A wage subsidy, for one, reduces the burden on government, and allows employers and employees to better adapt to changing conditions.

A stimulus, that, for lack of a better term, throws money at problems and has political strings attached will solve problems in the short term, but will cause long term pains that may be worse. 

And I don't know why you believe that we were headed for a depression, that's blatantly false.

I'd be happy to explain to you if you want in more detail.

That’s encouraging, thanks! Any particularly retarded resources you recommend for onboarding so I can start learning this shit?
Agreed if your just throwing shit at the wall to what sticks it should be like 20% or less of your $$ IMO
I made the mistake of buying weeklies this week, then buying more weeklies to cover my loss, failing to sell when the recovery calls had 90$ profit, then bought a put as it tumbled, sold that early for 20$ profit just to find out that put would’ve been worth 300.

T mobile has been doing really well, so there wasn’t really a reason for the drop other than the shitty week most stocks had. It’s been above 130 for the past month, dropped to 125 today. It has to recover tomorrow... right? I need my tendies 😂

I have some monthlies for them though that should succeed. Just gotta makeup for 200$ in stupid choices 😂
since when did puts need to be covered unless of they wrote puts?
.0003 to .01 since September, huge run already. Not a huge fan of the share structure but I’ll add it to the watch list. Thanks for your time, sir.

I hear people say the market is completely unhinged, I'm not sure I buy that.

Sure, there is Tesla and the EV market. And then there is GME.

But those are a loud minority. GME isn't even really unexplainable. The short sellers overdid it and now they are screwed. 

The rest of the market, particularly the tech side, is backed up by great earnings.
Sweet. I only made a few hundred.  I bought up a few shares based off a random dd post a few weeks ago. And of course now I am suffering from the classic I regret not buying more feeling. What price did you get in at?
Hang on. This youtube guy is deepfuckingvalue?

There's sell to close and sell to open, if I'm not mistaken, if you sell to close you sell the contract you bought at market rate and sell to open means you are writing a brand new contract someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

For some that is a lot. Tadpoles my boy. Happy tadpoles. Like me! I just don’t post.
Shares are both safer & make it more likely that it will go up.  If we’re right, then you should be looking at a 50% (or more upside), so why bother with timing it with options (the IV is crazy pricey right now)

I miss volatility Don.
Yes sir 🥺 I believe
Yup. Similar to NVDA, I bought AMD calls when it was trading at $9 when it was a total sleeper. Sold when the stock was at $40. In hindsight I should have rolled them.
Holy shit PLTR let’s goooo!
Research like their plans to close 1000 stores by April, or what research you talkin bout, bruh?
What a fuck’n tardass.
Yeah friend, get rid of those emotions. Just play with 5% of your money so you don’t feel like you missed out while still scratching that gambling itch.
I should have held the gme shares I had in the beginning of the day instead of trying to trade spy options on a day there was barely any movement 🤦‍♂️

What are the repercussions of that? Sorry I’m not too informed on the matter but I’m tryna look it up rn
Did you just login to Reddit now ?

Ayo question. If you buy a leap and nearing expiration, it’s otm. What’s your play from there?

Would you sell the calls? How much of a percent loss are you looking at with that?

And if you can’t find someone to sell to, does that mean you just exercise the option and buy at market price and take the L?
Heavy feeling of rotation out of tech and into clean energy tomorrow, or a sell off.
[I hate to be the “I told you so” guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx3ja5/daily_discussion_thread_for_january_14_2021/gj958sp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3 ) but it’s uncanny that I posted this during market hours today. Hope y’all listened, Palantards unite!🚀
GME March $200 strike when?
SENS looks like it’ll break out again tomorrow! After hours was up to 1.54 for a bit, could definitely see this one continue to go.
I started with $3k because that's the minimum for VTWAX. Then weekly $500 after that. 

There's no right answer. Do whatever you're comfortable with.
the few the proud....
MODS!
I do like fuel cells because of their energy density but I don't like NKLA.
Did I buy the dip


Are they fds

Or are they spreads with time
I made like 2k on Monday and lost 1k this morning staying away from Tesla until I see some big swings
lmao same. Looking at the market after literally every single practice question
You’re hopeful, be quick to catch the short rush!
If only I had learned that when I was 18
Yeah this article is trash
Any person remotely aware of Gamestop news the last 3 days would not short it atm.
Translation: no one sell tomorrow and hold on TIGHT. Don’t get tempted/panicked from drops and don’t get tempted from green
idk but sndl went up 5 cents. Hippies like me gonna buy more with their stimulus checks.
From the bottom of my heart I believe this is a historic moment that will be taught in macroeconomics classes in the 2050s in a little side panel blurb.
This is very dank thanks
I've got a small position in it. Got a bet that this one will be added into ARKX.
My wife just said “I bet he could buy me jewelry”

Well it's 1.9T. surprise.
Alrighty I’ll see you guys on the moon then

REMEMBER PLTR LOCKUP IS PRICED IN. WORKER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SELL 20% OF SHARES FOR A WHILE. GET IN NOW!!
Wait what end of day email
Sadge TLRY Dropped like 40 cents right at AH close
I believe that is illegal
lemme borrow $1 bro for gas
It's a lot of scapegoating and back-stabbing, and the Director position unfairly catches all of it. The difference in pay just isn't worth it.
Tyler will be collecting those extra $400 unemployment checks soon
As a mint mobile user, I approve this news 👌

GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
NIO always pumps like crazy during an event, wait a week for pullback and then buy LEAPS, that shit will still hit 100 EOY so you’re good
go get Yahoo's finance app, you can use it to scout companies. it'll show you the price of the company over time, how much dividend they will pay you to own the stock per year (yield), how much they make in revenue and profits, and a lot of other stuff. it can tell you if a company is a winner, in good health.

there are, like, hundreds of good plays at any moment! if you want to win, start by not losing; the economy just creates new value constantly, we can farm it by owning low-risk securities that pay. best is if you can get it for cheaper than it really ought to be, like when everybody panics for whatever reason. be brave in those times.
FB is down 11% the last 3 months. Why are we not buying the dip???
I love this subreddit, you can see the power it’s gained the last 2 years

So tired of my wife’s nonsense. It’s not a gambling problem if I’m ahead, right?
That's a laughably manipulated article written by someone who doesn't even invest. CLARK RANDALL is an "independent writer" on "race and class," not economics. He's literally a socialist advocating mass punishment of rich white people for being white and having money.
What are you gonna do when it hits 250 eod Tuesday?
That's awesome! I'm sure you can do that and even more! Hope to see you on twt.
What’s up with MMs offloading shares hedging 1/15 calls tomorrow??

Lol this is old news.

Cathie wood is the real new.
🙌
It’s not that they’re going to “continue to generate good sales” as much as it’s “start generating incredible sales through several new streams” if you know anything about Ryan Cohen’s past history.

This is currently a $3B company. Chewy is a $47B company. Not even the sky is the limit on this one.

Cramer is good people. He's a fan of WSB, mentions it all the time. He wants new money to succeed.
INCL tomorrow?
Buying tons and tons of Facebook tomorrow. What a great company that is absolutely not biased
comparing a strong black woman to property... wow
Feeling the same as me.... Maybe I'll just get an escort on instagram. They seem way hotter and $160 for 6 hours ain't bad. Thank god i live close to tijuana.
Yesterday my boss told me about DDD. I bought $1000 in shares and made $350 in 24 hours. It's not a million dollar options play, but, as a poor, I feel pretty good about it.
They could implement rent control.
I need such a big day from BIDU tomorrow it’s depressing 😢
Honestly this whole thing is messed up... someone in the 98% percentile of income has more in common with someone in the 60% percentile of income than they do with someone in the 99.5% percentile of income, yet the top 97+% of earners are vilified along with the top top guys.
Some people get a sense of purpose from belonging to a group of simmilarly-minded people. You know, the kind of people who buy those "If your boyfriend is not a trucker/soldier/<insert profession here> you have a girlfriend" tshirts. It's not for me, but I don't people down for wanting to belong.
GME Gang don't crack

Very bad idea
I might eventually break even on PLTR after all!
I got a 4 calls I. August for $50 each and sold them... they’re all at $2,000+ now
Hey, it’s a good gain for me too. But when there are $100k gains every day on here...

I think we're justing getting started
Agreed....
Sometimes I do, but just on Robinhood (where it doesn't count) in the middle of the night lol. It's like an eternal wave up and down. Feels empty and never quite works out.
By definition, if you made $1, someone gave up $1. Even if it’s borrowed money, it’s you giving the dollar up in the end... and then some.
Tbh I’m going back in (although in a smaller amount) but yeah this market has made no sense for a long time, if TSLA wasn’t proof of that then GME is just another reminder

Your statement has been made previously. There's always some fundamental reason to back up why it's apparently different this time.

But, for some reason, it never is.
Is this the bottom or is it gonna bottom again that tends to happen when I go in
Apple, Amazon, or Google. Personally I'd day Apple or Google.
Some of both but mostly naked options and spreads. I've been considering more lately to start selling covered calls on $TSLA though.
Let’s hope it holds up premarket tomorrow!
Thank you sir.
Buy TSLA puts

wtf happened to PLTR? what news? why rocket all of a sudden?
Lol how do they work?
> What stopped you from just waiting and executing?

The chance that the stock price drops.
The last few times gme spiked there was twice as many shares, they have their shares since then. We haven't even gotten started yet, not to mention we haven't even seen any shorts closing yet. You are literally watching the opportunity if a lifetime and taking about shorting it. You are a complete fucking dumbass

Yes
We should be thankful. Otherwise we wouldn't have a 150% shorted stock
Your thought process is in the right place, which is why I got out of APHRA now and got into TLRY before it (hopefully) takes off around the merger. 

Fun fact, I bought TLRY at IPO during that wild first month where it peaked at like $150. Ended up selling all my shares at $40 and never thought I’d be buying back in
I've purchased a heap of times since Dec 24th, average price is currently CAD$2.0317 for 42.8k shares.
Most of the people that make money here buy leaps if you hadn't noticed. Most of the FDs turn to loss porn.

It went past $26.5 after hours just now. Maybe it will stick there in the morning for you.
Lol completely understand, I'm in the same boat. I was lucky enough to get in below 19 though, so its fluctuations and overall sideways trading since Thanksgiving hasn't been bugging me much. 

Unsolicited advice: Keep a separate tracker of your holdings. Mark all the ones you're currently "long term" on. Make a rule for yourself: anything long-term, you have to hold it until at least two weeks after next earnings report, unless major news drops that causes material changes to your outlook (like what has been happening with BABA since November). 

All definitions of owning a stock/ETF "long-term" had better include waiting long enough for the next quarterly earnings. This will dramatically reduce your angst levels. 

Example: I'm heavy on AMD. It has dropped 10% in the last week. My target share price is 150-175, sometime between April and June of 2022. The last week hasn't changed this for me, so I give exactly 0.0 fucks about what has happened the last week. Intel's good news today did nothing to change my mind about AMD.
Incredible lol
I will be honest, I was drunk and I don’t know why I thought I found the next gold mine. I did absolutely no DD and sold all my shares and went in. So yeah hopefully just waiting for the next catalyst to roll back into ARK shares and monthlies.

All jobs have some 'job' aspects to them. That isn't necessarily bad, imo. I feel that a bit of struggle can be good for your soul. You just have to pick and choose where you spend your time. Also, having the freedom to leave is mentally powerful.

Just... finding the shit you wanna do. You like woodworking? Start making chairs (or some shit like that). You are going to have to deal with customers and there will be a sales aspect to it, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.
I'm long KRE calls the lot of them have ER tomorrow
Some crazy bitch bought a bunch
Serious question, how much money did you start with to get those gains, and how much did you need to initiate those options?
I don't have any videos, but I'm considering starting a youtube channel. I'm a full time trader, investor and asset manager so I have time to do so.
If the price moons AND you are ITM right? If you have a 45c and the price is 46 and you hold til close, you can make a profit of 100 (plus a tiny tiny premium) less the premium you paid? If you have 55c it is probably best to sell early to avoid theta decay?
We'll be sure to send u a postcard from mars

Unironically buying more GME, X and Vale
We’re still on the Trump pumps.
I didn’t know this was r/suburbproblems
It's a little risky to buy over $1.20 IMO. Massive support currently at $1. Should be a decent swing and a nice medium/long hold too though. Legislation gonna be on the president's desk soon which provides funding for domestic uranium.

WSB is just a 21st century symptom of an age old issue. As long as there are markets there will be irrational exuberance, bubbles, downturns, etc. It's not a WSB problem, it's a problem with unrestrained capitalism.

I'm not advocating one way or another, it's just reality. The big boys might try to blame the next collapse on WSB, Tesla or what have you, but this is the game.
I can’t decide if he likes us, hates us, or is simply entertained by us.
Feel like it’s to late now but idk for GME
Then they would buy back the puts with cash not stocks...
They’re trying so hard to cope. It’s so funny

> quality/stable dividend stocks are a good alternative to bonds yielding almost nothing

Absolutely and unequivocally false. The reason why bonds are a good hedge to growth stocks is because they have a negative correlation. Dividend stocks have less returns and are still positively correlated. That is a garbage hedge.
The problem with RH and WB is that they don't trade OTCs, which why I was asking about traditional stock brokers
Dude. Dont give up. Im a year younger than you, but instead of busting my balls with a degree, i put that effort working my way up the banking ladder with my high-school diploma.

Just put in the work, solid work. Its rough, but you will be noticed. I didn't apply to be where i am, i was picked because they needed someone like me.

Remind me in 3-4 years. 100% you'll be in a better place.

Dope, can't wait to sell at open. I figured my $255c were dead

So my 1/15 $42c might print? That would blow my mind if that happens.
Anybody else getting overly suspicious about how well they've been doing lately?

I was an IC for 25+ years.  If I even went back into tech I think I would lie on my resume and say that I've come over from a different career:  history, sociology, photography.  That way I would be able to just be a junior position and not give a fuck about advancement nor extra responsibilities.

>hydrogen 

Let me stop you right there. Hydrogen as an energy medium is doomed to fail. Compared to lithium batteries, hydrogen has a lower energy density and is vastly more difficult to produce and transport. 

Moreover, it doesn't even provide any discernable advantages over lithium batteries. Elon Musk even called hydrogen cars a "dumb idea".

Weed stonks boutta be as high as the millennials trading em
If everyone who asked about it would buy, the short squeeze would be properly squoze again. Let me know where you guys stand with it.
Such a sour hour for x today.
lol. i prefer lead flavor
Dang, 1k from a call here.
I sold for 35k if you look at my comment history I posted the screenshot like 50 times
Lol, and this is what people were saying to deepfuckingvalue when he was buying calls.

Yeah, the guy buying GME at over 50% of what it was 5 fuckin years ago is the genius lol.
Dude look at it this way. You did public service for the WSB retards so that they can make tendies in their PLTR bags.
Party like its 2006.
What this commotion about BB (blackberry)?
Link??? I wanna see!!
It’s like a tennis game where no one wants to drop the ball. That’s why we went from 310$ to 210$ so quickly too tho. We just passed the hate back and fourth.
Citibank: downgrade PLTR

Cathie: NOT SO FAST
BB GO BRRRRRR 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I know there's a ticker called YOLO.
I don't know why more people aren't in that one.
Gotcha.  It is definitely different, and the community is absolutely more respectable and fact driven driven for sure.  That's why I use it, I just feel like the staff are attempting to monetize it in the same way other platforms do as well, they are just more careful about how, which makes me feel.like it's the same, if you follow.  Depending on how you look at it, could be better or worse.  I am of the opinion that all social media is ultimately bad for your brain, esp for people like me who deal with severe anxiety, which makes them all look the same from my chair.  I read magazines or books like medical journals or the economist to get my academic reading in, still a better source for me since I don't have to wade through the same garbage articles about politics to get there, that and the lack of comments allow me to draw my own conclusions.  Maybe I should curate my feed some, but doing that is just like adjusting your fb feed and ultimately narrowing your view.  🤷🏻‍♂️. Win some lose some I guess.
In cathie we trust
How do I profit off this?
BB $20 by EOM

Most brokers will convert it for ya without a margin issue as long as the selling value of the calls exceeds the execution cost.
Just remember the only thing that matters for the markets tomorrow are bank earnings.
Yes lol

Hop in boy
Same lol. You ever dive into those chat rooms?
Following.
They make more sitting at home than some healthcare workers make being recorded to infected people on a daily basis. They should've gave bonuses to those workers as well, to be fair.
nice. I was looking at it when it dropped to 17 last year but never considered it because I didn't understand what the business was really about.
Lol there isn’t one. A situation like GameStop’s is a once in a lifetime type deal.
As if a boomer can understand what the fuck is going on in here
We’re rich bitch!!!!!
The key is the volume. A WSB (redditor) can come in and buy 100s of shares if they wanted to, but the short sellers eventually need to buy 3 times more shares than are available to be sold (allegedly).
Man ... u/deepfuckingvalue is receiving so many mentions he could basically dictates the next short. Fuck 2% of GME, he might make 2% of anything at this point.

I sold 29c’s for tomorrow and even I’m scared. I bet it goes retard like SPCE

That’s most of what I did was pivot tables/ pivot charts very basic stuff organizing data. I think the most complex formula was an index match match on item and column headers done dynamically to work over several matching columns (1 formula).

It was single handedly the most impactful thing I’ve done in my life, and it brings me great joy to share this with you all

I like that PLTR AH action. Holding may 17.5c and jan 2022 25c and shares.
I'm hoping for a correction and for it to hold sub $45 for the next week so my covered calls don't get exercised next week lmao
I might go in on this.  The thing is streaming alone won't replace the money a single marvel movie can make.  Endgame by itself made 2.7B.  That is one movie making 2.7B.  I just don't see people letting that slip away.  No streaming service is making 2.7B more worth of subscriptions revenue cause of 1 movie coming out.
I mean market just opened so let’s see bro
Maybe it will pop. I have a few shares

FuTUreS aRe BLoOD reD duh.
So what caused the massive gain for GME now as opposed to a few few weeks before or a few weeks later? Is that just coincidence that a bunch of shorts tried to get out while a bunch of people bought at the same time?
F
him and the car tree guy are gonna get straightened out
Not bottom yet. The short squeeze will start soon once the political BS fades

r/pennystocks
Not if...it's when bro
what does it mean that the $43 call has 0 open interest?
Computers aren’t just for sharing memes, we can also use them to do things that would otherwise take us too long. 

The results would be biased with the bull market, a strong pullback could also result in negative return memes. Only way to know how reliable it would be is to implement it.
I looked around and found someone so much smarter than me lol. They said this:

With the volume of puts sold, whoever sold them needs to hedge (basically insure their loss incase they expire deep in the money), they do this by opening a tonne of short positions, when the puts expire worthless these short positions get closed by buying back shares they sold short.
To the moon 🌚🌚🌚
Buy the rumor, sell the news, not buy the news.
So what ur saying is my 1/15 $40c that I bought for $2.00 but is now $.01 is going to print

Thank you for your TED talk
So did that one guy say anything that would pump ICLN to a massive green dildo tomorrow? Help a peasant out
So he anticipates it to go down tomorrow otherwise why wouldn’t he have held?

Yikes...
Got the same strike esketit
Went up to 1.7 at some point but it’s been at 1.61 for awhile now. Should I continue holding on to it or shld I sell?
Maybe if your chart stops at 5 years. It was above 30 in 2011 and above 40 in 2008.
Ark started buying it
I can't tell if this is sarcasm or not
Maybe BB was the one to buy and not ICLN

You are absolutely right. They see trump as a liability. This is a strategic pivot away from him. He’s made them a lot of money but his usefulness is waning. They’ve calculated it’s better to cut bait now, coincidentally at the end of his term 😉. I guess seditionist using your platform will do that. 

Tangentially related, I wish we’d all stop pretending corporations care about anything other than money. They only exist to make money. I don’t care how much of a good game they talk, it’s just marketing. They don’t care about you, why would they? We shouldn’t care about them. Them giving money to charity is nice and all but I’d rather them pay more in taxes so we don’t need their charity.
Because VIX is the devil and it mixes the truth with lies.

Closing stores is bullish. It's cutting costs and non profitable cash burns.

They're paying off debt faster than anyone anticipated.

They have a deal with MSFT for a cut of ALL digital game sales in the Xbox store.

They've expanded to all and everything gaming. Need a phone case controller? GME. Need a new mobo or GPU? GME.

50 million power up rewards members is consumer access that literally cannot be bought anywhere else.

Ever heard of Chewy?

There's piles of research on why GME is bullish.

Mfs will trade tesla and nio to the fucking moon when they're already valued at 1000x earnings.

No, because I’m not retarded. The 1/15 40c I bought yesterday morning are doing pretty good though.
Once i hit a predetermined value, i scaled back my 401k contributions. The balance in these accounts will afford me a good retirement once i am 59.5 with no further contributions and an assumed 7.5% return from here on out.

I really need to stop putting my money in Robinhood 😂
Actually watching "The Big Short" got me to that conclusion. The whole tangent the character portrayed by Brad Pritt goes on about how when the unemployment rate goes up 1% so does the mortality rate, or something of the kind. A harsh truth.
Cramer pumping the bbby post holy crap
Ok bois, ill admit im actually a boomer and ive been buying stocks all this time and have no clue how options work.

With options, is your liability only limited with your positions?

For example if i buy a SPY 400c expiring next week or whenever and it doesnt hit that price and stays at the current price, does my option expire worthless?

What if the current price is 380, and it tanks to 360, what happens to my position?

Thanks and i know im gay and retarded.
Biden the type of guy to have Boston Dynamic pet dogs

It means no one holds a contract
Yup ARKW
google searched this and still confused. what do you mean give an offering?

Riots pending, yes but also riots that happened.  The idea that absolutely nothing is going to happen is dangerous and false.
No one likes Zuck to begin with and FB is being blamed for a lot of political issues. But FB is simply too low right now to pass it up. It was last this low in September and July for god's sake

Fuck them
Do u even have GME or BB gains lmao 🤦🏽‍♂️ 🌈
Dang I wish the market was open right now..
There's still sizeable enough moves to make money on
Fuck that. Pltr tô the moon. Auntie cathie bought it
Sold a third of my shares at $7.06 and still holding. I'm hoping for a short squeeze tomorrow where they'll be scrambling and buying more shares.

Volume didn't surpass the 10 day average so tomorrow will be very interesting to say the least🙂

I'm just glad I decided on funding a much larger amount on BNGO than JAGX so for once it's worked out yay 🙂
PLTR will go to the 🌚. But do you remember in Men in Black where those aliens were playing with marbles and each marble was its own galaxy? GME will leave the Milky Way marble, shoot through the head of the alien, and go to the 🌚 in whatever fucked up supra galaxy they play marbles in.
Lmao maybe
E*Trade is the one I would prefer.
Google “blackberry”
Yes. Or if you must "prove" it to yourself, study up as much as you can and open a very small account with money you can afford to lose. Day trade one share at a time and then assess your results. As others have said, you'll see how hard it is to be consistently profitable. And you'll feel much worse if you put up all your capital right away and quickly lose it.  I wish you and your family well.
i cant wait for ICLN to spit in between my asscrack and lay its throbbing shrek cocks between my butt cheeks and just tease me by grinding my ass

u/deepfuckingvalue just admit that you’re from the future, sent by Elon back on Earth for the reform of the free markets through catering WSB to the large audience and hence making investors rise against the status quo imposed by MM, regulators, big banks, brokers and boomers.   ay, pass that shit to me 🚬👄

Ok.that sounds closer to what ice been hearing
Will we see the ICLN pump tomorrow that we were promised?

Congrats on not giving up! That's the key. Losing money is not a reason to give up. Not understanding why you lost money is. I've spent my whole adult life constantly learning (a lot of the time by making mistakes). A lot of good advice to heed re index funds. I would say it is also wise to do at least some stock picking if you have enough to build a mini divirsified portfolio. It will teach you a lot about yourself (patience, greed, fear, ego). The most important thing is to be honest with yourself: did you make a killing because you were smart or because you were lucky? Even the most seasoned investors struggle with this. Good Luck in 2021!
yeah but it was upgraded by cathie and wsb so ...

Usually for promotions like that, the bank account has to stay active/open for a certain duration in order to 'keep' the signup bonus. I personally like Capital One. I have a couple of checking, savings and credit cards with them. I haven't had any issues.

The banks just look for the deposit and there's no minimum balance required. I would read the fine print like the other comment said.
how is that possible

Hi big dummy here, if I buy $3 call options expiring in 2022 for BP (Currently trading at 25.63) for 22.43 a call. 

Assume BP stays at 25.63 tomorrow at open, is that a free 20 cents a call? 

So if I put 10k down on puts, I’d make 2k easy?
Hold tight brother and keep your head back because it’s gonna rocket very quick
Gme retards would be more tolerable if there wasn't 500 questions about a squeeze, ridiculous pt, and talking about melvin
If you sold the stock at a loss and did not buy back you could hold the loss. 
You could also buy into a similar company. For example sell one airline company and buy another one so you can take a loss but overall maintain the same position.

If you can’t afford to exercise it expires worthless and you only lose what you pay for it. If it’s far OTM and nearing expiration you might be down 99.99% with no buyers anyway.  Watch some YouTube vids guy.
The next big short squeeze is 🎛☀️ cannabis stock.

Almost 40 percent of the float is shorters. Also a lot of good news coming weeds way. If you weren’t there for GameStop be there for ☀️🎛.

GME Trail Stop Zerg Blitz Theory

Several posts have recommended against using a stop on GME because it can be seen on L2 and used for stop hunting.  However, if thousands of small investors all use trail stops of different amounts, does the data become too difficult to manage and track for stop hunters?  If the trailstop was around 10 points, but something randomly chosen like $10.03 or $10.07, would that be too hard for algorithms to stop hunt?   

The end game of the GME squeeze could be in the next week.  More and more people will use stops, but I thought this theory could help more people stay in the squeeze without taking profits too early.  Is it a terrible idea?
I truly believe Cathie loves us.

BB is gonna print
The value of the option goes down if the price of the stock goes down. And if it doesn't hit the price target yes it expires worthless.
Why wouldn’t an institution see this and buy up the remaining shares to further induce squeeze?

All credit to DFV for this amazing play but I think we have to give some credit to the person who started investigating that short list. Seems like the MM was playing games until that started to come to light and Cramer put it on spotlight.

fast food chains are automating the whole procedure of ordering anyway (McD, Burger King etc.), not only because of $$ savings but also cause its faster and probably encourages a lot of upselling (u buy more products at a terminal, I suppose). minimum wage is not the driving factor here I suppose
I bought and sold Tesla over and over last year. Had I just held onto it for a year my profits would've been 4x and I would've paid half as much in taxes. So hold onto for the long term.

Immediately abandon that plan and buy PLTR shares tomorrow.

That's totally fair. Best of luck on your life after Intel :)
Yes, 100%
1mw of nuclear costs as much as 6mw of renewables. 

And nuclear gets more expensive over time. Renewables get cheaper. 

It’s more cost effective to bulldoze already-paid off nuclear plants and take out a loan to build renewables there. 

Even if you could afford to build a lot of nuclear plants - it typically takes 10-15 years to go from planning to operation. We don’t have time to wait, need clean energy now.
I had 100 shares of NVDA at 20..... sold at $80...... can’t play that game, too depressing to think what could have been lol.

Oh shit actually in this case cathie wood bought it
I’m just gonna let you guys know now, I’m buying GME and BB in the morning so you may wanna buy puts
I don't think that this will pass because of the raise of minimum wage to $15 federally across the country in such a short time. I don't think even if it did pass that the country could manage to switch to that in such a short time period of time. If this does pass the money would be nice we've all experienced tough times, though just because the minimum wage goes up doesn't mean that the price of daily living won't go up. Everything will go up, that's what the majority of people now days do not realize. That stimulus would be great though, I won't say no to another stimulus!

Nah, most of my portfolio is in Tesla Shares.. Tesla has made me a shit load of money since February

I did read about the merger before initially investing, but I don’t know anything about converted shares. Tilray isn’t in my portfolio. I’m definitely missing something here lol
I’m not the most read on space and cyber as it comes to these companies, but I do know Lock Mart appears to have the 5th generation aircraft market cornered, now if we’re thinking decades long then it’s very grey because LMT has the experience and is familiar to the defense industry when it comes to a good production line.

The F-22 is still unmatched and one of the reasons they chose it over the F-23 was that they were better at marketing it. Now the AF, Navy, and USMC may be concerned about future contracts due to some of the hick ups in the F-35 program, but they still got an amazing plane out of it in the end.

Now interestingly enough, both companies have unveiled interesting 6th Gen fighter concepts that look relatively similar. Now it doesn’t appear that Northrop is working with Douglas again (which has been rather rather poor in the past decade if I recall correctly) which will help improve their chances, however I don’t see NOC beating out the more experienced and trusted LMT.

Now there’s also the drone market which as stated by the AF and the Navy for their own versions of the F-A/XX programs will likely be used alongside them.

NOC has the benefit of having built up trust with the Global Hawk and the Triton, however it has not come out with any new stealth designs or put them into use. LMT has come out with the RQ-170 and has used it with the AF and CIA. That being said we lost one of those drones to Iran and only around 20 have been built.

In the end, I would say that LMT due to a successful fifth generation program, more successful stealth drone program, and a few other factors is more likely to be the better option in the long term.

Prob can put in $500 without shitting bricks. Why is it even going up?
You get to pop it’s cherry.
I think you’re just identifying the difference between options that trade against an equity underlying and those that trade against futures. VIX options are cash settled and since the underlying can’t be replicated, they have a term structure that essentially tracks the futures. 

Calendar spreads on equity options allow you to bet on the IV expanding or contracting because the IV at different expirations is strongly linked. There is still some term structure, but not nearly what you see in options based on futures products.
I use a calculator with a checkbox that lets you turn it on and off. I assume it will only be 70% in the case I include it.
I'm at 380 at $28.80. I bought at the peak haha. Oh well, they're shares. Just hold long.

Calls on an ETF
Thanks for putting in the time and effort to write this strat and share with everyone.  Wish we had more posts like this. I gained more from this thread than everything posted here in the past three months.  But I guess people keep their strategy guarded like kfc's secret ingredients.
By "challenge" I was really intending to say a level of market share where Nvidia would definitely feel it. And I can't imagine a scenario where AMD takes even 10% of that market by 4 years from now because the software ecosystem maturity just is not there and that's the slowest part of the whole process.
I spent $100k on NIO options this week. I wish I was only down 2.5%. Stay strong, pal.

Im all GME right now obviously. After that, no fucking clue. Smooth brain here 🙋🏻‍♂️
BB, BBY, BBBY

Buy em all
This is the right way
End of year.  Rather than thinking it as investing in GameStop, think of it as a gamble on Ryan Cohen. The fundamentals look solid and Cohen has a proven track record.
I think she saved mine for tomorrow too!
I'm really trying to minimize taxes, but yeah I've considered that option.
He sold the 1/15 per his last update.

And yes, but he has like $2.2 million now.  So if he had 2000 contracts to buy at $10, he could do just that.
>TSLA is beating SPY in daily volume basically every day now and in the past 30 days Tesla has seen about $1.1T in trading, about double SPY's and about as much as the stock traded in 2018 & 2019 combined.

[Real median household income has beaten inflation with a considerable margin.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N)

And in areas where minimum wage is lower, purchasing power is considerably higher.

Even if we wanted to increase minimum wage, a time when small businesses are in their worst position since the Great Depression isn't the time, and it should not be so suddenly massive a rise, more gradual.

Your timeline is way too shortsighted
Let's see if the 1/22/22 15c prints too!
Will i be liable for recouping the loss? I.e. it goes below the call price i bought it in for?

Or it will literally just expire worthless. What if nothing happens? I.e. the options stays at the price i bought it in?
497,100?
Cherry picked but fine, dude.

Ryan Cohen took over Chewy when it was failing, made it an Amazon competitor. Oh wait, he won actually, then sold to PetCo for 3.3 billion dollars.

He installed himself on the board after buying almost 15% of the company.

But sure, you're smarter than him, know more, and clearly took the time to research. Me and my DOUBLED IN 2 DAYS retirement account will fuck right off.

It’s not a gambling problem if you’re behind, either. That’s just a “dip” which is intelligent-investing-terminology for “new place to buy more.”
It's never good to buy at open tbh

This might be the one exception
Just bought 50 shares this afternoon, didn’t even know blackberry was a still a company this morning.  Came on this board and saw one of my fav memes regarding BB.

Bought it solely on the meme.
Nope, VTSAX is a mutual fund. AFAIK you generally can't trade mutual funds across borders.

OP's friend could instead buy the ETF equivalent (eg. VTI) or find a similar index fund that's offered in their country with a low MER.
Eoy, yes

Dad plz it's me. I need trading money.
I started investing in around early 2008.  When stuff started to tank in what became known as the financial crisis I doubled down hard on a lot of financials and banks.  Ended up losing around 50 or 60% of my capital.  

I’ve done very well since, but I feel there is more risk to the downside than upside so have been increasing my cash and positioning my portfolio more conservatively.
someone earlier said 250

Yeah that’s where he gets the idea to steal liposuction waste to make soap.
I sold a $25C and $35C for 1/15 last week as the stock price drifted down to $17’s. The calls were worth pennies per share at that point. I missed out on an additional $2K in gains. I was also a dumbass and sold a $23CC on 100 of my 150 shares. My price per share $20.16. I missed another $2000 in gains in those 100 shares. I did make a handsome profit on my 50 shares I sold. I’ve had to calm down and realize hindsight is 20/20, I could have had the opposite and just sold everything for a loss. Glad I didn’t!
Accidentally just called my wife’s cousin a pussy for investing in VOO and idk how to turn it around.

Yes so anything you sell in less than 12 months you get taxed at your income tax bracket level. So it could be 20-35%+ depending of course on how much money you are making that year. So options positions that are sold within the year will be taxed like that. 

&#x200B;

Long term holds wont be taxed until you sell them. For me, I dont want to sell until more than 12 months at least so it qualifies as a capital gains tax, which is 15% currently. Although the current administration might raise that. If you dont sell you dont pay taxes.
A WSB ETF should be GME, PLTR, BB, and TSLA
Yeah, I agree.  I don't have any plans to sell.
Sir, this is amazing! I can see it now WSB on broadway. Fantastic job, I love it!
Sell, take my sweet tendies and buy the shares direct.
pray to stonk gods it stays around the teens in the morning
NEE always has been one of my top holdings. Only boomer shares though, no options. Fantastic company and has been the top performing stock in its industry for years.
STIC ALL DAMN DAY
Loool

I have 2 rentals making about $800/mo after PITI each.


When these tenants are out, I’m going to hire a PM for my next set of tenants.


It was important to learn how to do it, but every time something goes wrong it’s when I’m on vacation. Worth the $100/mo.



When it’s good, it’s good, 3-4 months without lifting a finger. When it’s bad, it sucks. It’s 40hrs of labor around my job, trying to make a drive to the property and meet a contractor on my lunch, etc.


Worth the $1200/year/rental to have the 40hrs back if even one issue happens.



I had 1 big issue and other small issues— like the drain disconnected in the crawl, crawl got wet, oh well, it’s a crawl, but had to meet a plumber there to reconnect it and it was cold and the plumber no showed, etc etc.... Then it cost $200... the PM I’m gonna use does cost — $35/hr for their plumber/electrician/handyman + materials. So the whole thing would have cost $35 and some glue which is $5 for a jar if I even got charged.
I jumped in earlier this week with 1k shares at .64 cents
TSLA when moon?
Fuckin hit my stop loss on GME bout 4 times this week
Siri he's on to us...

I’ve watched this at least 10 times

Well shit, sorry you had to see this...
No. The short selling will continue
ZOM does this consolidation thing every time before a pop. Been in since .39. It just trades side ways and coil up. 

Look at BNGO and the coil they had at the $1 range, specifically Dec 28th, BNGO had the break over the New Years and then flew on the 4th,  first day back after a long weekend is always great, we have MLK day and the Biden Inauguration happening plus there will be a new round of stimulus within weeks of Biden taking office now. The Dems  controlling both house and senate and people are going to look for opportunities to load up there Robinhood accounts and find something to run with. With so many thing happening before March I know this will break it’s 2018 high of $2.98 at least but I think it has a good chance to fly to a stupid price and then pull back as it should. It’s the perfect storm for this stock!
Aight spce.

Don’t fucking tell me it had this 20% day bc cathie woods is buying?
That’s exactly what the market has been pricing in the last couple of weeks.
I just ordered a chicken quesadilla on my Robinhood debit card

What's dd? Oh you mean like reading things about a stock? Why would I do that when I could just write a song with extremely limited knowledge...
Oh my god. I saw it at 9.23 thinking "How much higher can it go"

I had 1k on hand to just buy a bunch of cheap calls. Fuck
I once played a pick up game of 3 on 3 with Sammy Sosa

> one dem in senate is all it takes.

not even. 

if every dem in the senate supports the bill, it STILL takes 60 votes to override a fillibuster, and a bill with a poison pill like a $15 minimum wage isn't going to meet that threshold.
🚀
Thank you for the correction and thank you for the information.
>	Also BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

This is the most important point.
What is the expense ratio for this? Fees?
It’s up because arkw increased their holding in PLTR not this.
Facebook has enough money to buy off those politicians.

Thanks for the write up and I appreciate the explanation! I hope we see a run up like that tomorrow, this is absolutely the right environment for it.  I never even considered the majority of the calls would be sold naked.. probably because the only calls I’m allowed to write are either already covered in shares or with spreads. Thx for the post too, GL tomorrow

You haven’t missed anything yet. WSB will be sending this stock to $100 with jim cramers backing. Keep squeezing the shorts so nobody ever even thinks of selling
If you want to lose money, it's better if you donate it to a nice charity
I think tomorrow is gonna hurt for the hydrogen stocks. I'm scared.

Nice brrr coming thru
The only time I've ever touched shares was when rh gave me my free stock. funny enough it was GME but I thought it was gay 2 years ago so sold it immediately

is this real the fuck?
Is PDT tied to the brokerage account or owner?
Social media is the Dems' bitch. I wouldn't touch it.
If you purchase an option, no matter what, your max loss is the cost of the option. 

If you sell an option your max loss is the current stock price minus the option's strike price. For example if a stock is 10 and you sell a 15 call and then the stock goes to 20, you max loss would be current price (20) minus option strike price (15) for a loss of 5.
I remember when we use to make fun of share buyers around these parts. What happened?

I can't tell if you are trolling or not but if you aren't you are a fucking retard. Look at the recent earnings report and then look at their market cap, there is room to 10x from here and still have a very respectable PE of like 5. Not even including short interest

So here is what I will say. I think we have to have some down moments at this point. Maybe we will have another year where some of us get 110% but I can say for certain that 3 years in a row without some down turns no way in hell. So it is best to just trim some off. Put some in muni Bonds. Take 20% out. Just imagine a 10-20% drop in stocks overall and think what you can buy back with that 20% in muni bonds. I am getting ready do this myself. Having said all this a 20% dip is for sure a great buy since fed is at 0% and said for next 3 years it will be there. But it won’t be like this forever maybe we will get record earnings this year and have another up year but rest assure there will be some down turns on the way there at the very least a rotation out of risk on assets.
its good

lol, ok... The market completely shrugged off a pandemic, millions unemployed, factory orders tanking, debts in default, and keeps breaking new all time highs in the midst of it all.

"But tech" is the new (old) rationalization for irrational market valuations. It will continue until it doesn't.

So PLTR will clearly gap up at open, but do you guys think it will continue the rise?
Will it be too late to buy tomorrow? Fuck me
Not late at all, we’re just getting started baby 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀❌❌❌❌
BTFD I really think that Biden will put infrastructure into his economic plan so I'm assuming X will rise over the year if infrastructure programs start buying steel.
This I am trying to figure out myself. I understand that calls etc can net more $ with increase. But is it a harder slog to buy shares and hope for a long increase? I seem to only have the ability to buy full shares not options in calls etc. ? Advice!?
PLTR is a meme company this ones legit.
Lol
Wheres the fckn rockets
Whyyyyy bro don’t tell me this
No need. He’s either cool or a pussy. It is what it is.
I'm not autistic so idk, but how do people even know to buy these sorts of stock. I have no clue what I'm doing.

I will say from personal experience that Schwab (if you use them) flagged me a pattern day trader after only two violations. It’s more a soft warning (a nice, letter in the mail titled “YOU’VE BEEN LABELED A PATTERN DAYTRADER”), and they revoked it immediately when I called and claimed ignorance, but still, they’re vigilant. I’m luckily over $25K now in the account I daytrade in.
I'm afraid of how often we are being discussed in the regular media
Wtf is Canada
I wouldn’t play downside dude, I’d scale in longs below 45

Ain’t no thang. It goes up and down. Last week I gained $115k, this week I dropped $20k. I’m still a’ight.
Yeah, this is what a lot of people don't realize with minimum wage. If you can't provide greater than $15 per hour in value to your company, they aren't going to pay you $15 per hour. I would 100% expect the lowest paid jobs that can be automated - like cashiers at fast food restaurants - will largely go away. You already see the 8 cash registers at supermarkets with 1 monitor to help people... that will only be sped up with a higher minimum wage.
> lucky timing

Lmao how delusional is this guy. In what ways is 2005 lucky timing. 2005-2008 was still a pretty shitty time for growth stocks, the NASDAQ in particular. Lucky timing would be investing right at the start of the 2009 bull run. Anyway, at what point does luck just become normal? If after 16 years your strategy is still losing are you just unlucky or is it a shit strategy?

My dude I’m still diamond holding 1/15 20c. I couldn’t bring myself to close them today knowing that the puts are expiring tomorrow.
Cause they have a deal with Sony to run the OS in there EV and they run cyber security now and the government loves bb so easy money it just been undervalued because of the boomers.
Thank you for dumbing it down for me, seriously appreciate it !

Somebody good at maths, how much do y’all think BB 2/19 12.50Cs will be worth at open? Wanted to take advantage of tomorrow’s pop at open but now I’m thinking i bought too far out for max gains. They’re currently $.76 but that was at close pre AH pop. Hold?
Stop, I can’t get any harder!
“Officials working on the Trump administration’s data collection efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic have suggested to transition officials for President-elect Joe Biden that the new team get rid of a newly minted system originally designed by the Silicon Valley company Palantir, warning that it is not accurate.”
