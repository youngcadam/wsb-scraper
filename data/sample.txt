i like to sell these type of options towards 2 pm. Look at how TSLA reacted to Fridays when it was heavily shorted this year. Look at how the stock moved across the day, it should be roughly equivalent. 

TSLA is the best analog for how these situations have played out within a WSB crowd.
icln a little bitch right now
I got 2 $15c for mid feb
is it a big dick play or a medium dick play or a small dick play? thats the question.

That's logically correct, but here at WSB we don't exercise the options  


We either sell them to some who's dumber than us, or we let it expire worthless, thus completing the full life cycle of WSB

Surging! SURGING!
Plus the new 5000 series for mobile CPUs is, according to their claims, way more powerful and uses way less wattage, so I suspect that buying now and holding will yield value, but I'm retarded.
is GME gonna run another 20% open tmrw?? thinking of jumping back in
Okay melvie. Dont hurt me.
Our boys at the unknown financial institution
probably wouldn‚Äôt buy the bear leg until open tomorrow, with how this stock has been trending lately it‚Äôll probably gap up overnight

Yo wtf is going on holy shit
I'm thinking about getting into call debit spreads but am concerned that I don't fully understand the risk. I want to spend at least another couple weeks really trying to understand it so any advice is greatly appreciated. I just searched youtube and reddit for two hours and I still haven't found much to answer my questiosn. 

\- Say I I'm looking into a vertical debit spread. Is this financially irresponsible since I don't have the money to actually cover 100 stocks in the event that I'm assigned (I would want to start with practice money maybe $2k)? 

\- If I am assigned, will RobinHood put into massive debt or will it simply close the bottom strike buy call and make me cover the difference?

\- Are the risks of being assigned diminished if I simply close a ITM spread a week out from expiration?

Thanks for the help! Honestly sounds too good to be true in a bullish market.
hope u listened

A straddle perhaps but with the large positions i dont think thats possible
Come on you bitch market
GME
Kamala Harris (VP) sponsored the MORE Act which essentially legalized marijuana federally. It has already been voted on and passed Congress, the Senate is waiting until the new President is elected before voting on it. As you mentioned, the Democrats won the Presidency, the House, and the Senate. Kamala Harris is the tie breaker for Senate votes. 

All that said, the legalization of marijuana is closer that it has ever been before and with the VP being the tie breaker of the bill she introduced, it is even more likely to pass (if needed). 

TL;DR: Yes, TLRY is gonna rocket. I've had 40 shares since it was 9.66 like a month ago.

Depends on the time of the day. If it hits $50 with a few hours left then you'll likely see green. If not, the price would have to go over 'break even' price ($51.98) for you to profit.

It's a bloody shame, really.  They were brave lads.
Do you think that a sound operational knowledge of what you're doing is helpful when managing or overseeing an operation, or do you believe in the idea that any "competent manager" can be dropped in to a situation to apply sound management techniques regardless of the underling subject matter?

Because ultimately you are going to find the most operationally qualified individuals in industry, not in academia (unless they came from industry).  And very often the most qualified individuals go to the most profitable companies, who can pay the best wages.  And those tend to be the companies people despise, due mainly to their wild profitability.
FUCKING BUY GME
good write up.. im in !
How the fuck did you get it for 0.53? I bought at open for $1.85 like a complete idiot. I am still sitting here kicking myself. Congrats though.
Second this. Even consoles are just becoming pre-built PCs and given another full generation that's exactly what they'll be. Whatever GME "wants" to become, Newegg already is. But once again, you can get all your gaming needs from Newegg, AMZN, Target, Walmart, and Microcenter, why would I use GME instead? Nostalgia?
I mossied the whole ride, but i heard that it not to late. I dont have much but I bought a call expiring tomorrow and 30 shares.

Jump in nowsies
If they have about 50M in equity in $24 1/15 puts, then what could they possibly do to hedge against that position apart from selling those contracts?  Even if those contracts expire worthless, that 50M loss can't turn into a larger loss.  Sure, they could hedge by buying shares, but that seems like a leap of faith that could actually lose them more money if the price goes down, as opposed to trying to sell the last of their puts and calling it a shitty day.  
I'm not extremely well versed in this world, but I'm not aware of any positions they could open today or tomorrow that would 100% prevent loss on these 1/15 puts.
ICLN - 2/19 33c

Lets get this bread, Buyden!
The PE license should happen early this year (already passed the test!). The manager position for my SO is less certain; he may move to a different company first since the industry he works in (manufacturing for airplanes) is not doing so hot right now. He was supposed to get the promotion in March right before COVID, but it's been "on-hold" ever since. If he does change companies he's pretty sure he would be able to negotiate for a raise even if he doesn't get manager. The delay in career goals is something to consider though, moving forward.

Got in at $11 while ago, stocks unfortunately, but ready too moon nonetheless. To be honest, idk if weed is legalized within 2 years before the next house/senate elections, but I think it‚Äôll be decriminalized and descheduled for sure. At least not legal federally, but if NY legalizes, states will follow. It‚Äôll just be a matter of time.

You could be right.

This guy just seemed more methodical about it though. It wasn't just "Dems win, weed up!" There was way more research and thought put into it and it turned out to be right.

I think it definitely helps that GME kinda has the market corners. Other places sell games and consoles but when you think of gaming store you think Gamestop in the US at least. So unlike a steel play or a weed play where there are a bunch of options, if you're banking on the gaming industry it's Gamestop.
MMs
Ive been doing the same today.

Will you buy before close?
Tech is fucking dead now
Yea I cashed out and swiched to Tesla
Get the fuck in guys, strong close!
absolutely, nothing more efficient for daytrading comes to mind.

The bid/ask spreads are razor thin, the reason it's popular is because you can define entry + exit points and get in and out of a trade quickly, while getting the best fills.
Nah I wasn‚Äôt planning to use that 2k anyways. All good spy/apple
I have 2022 and 2023 LEAPS. Hoping we see more up than down for TLRY this year. Fingers crossed.
Uhh where the gains at? Am I retarded or are you retarded?
There is a post around here with some math in it. This references that post.
I started in June and I'm 33.3% up and I lost money on stupid stocks too (I sold TSLA in Aug when it dropped from $1080 to $899 in a panic etc). The trick I've really learnt in this market is just to hold and it'll be fine in the end. Until the crash comes lmao.

Theta changes throughout the day - Go watch the Theta on some GME Puts and see what I mean - I sold GME 15 Jan Puts earlier today with a theta of -96 at the time - currently sitting at -63 and the IV went from 323% to about 260% - an extreme case for certain, but it will show you how theta is always changing during trading hours -
We know we are... Thanks for the share! ‚úäüèΩ
>An increase of shares outstanding is inflation for current owners

Yes... but it isn't inflationary of market cap, of absolute revenue, or absolute income. It's not relevant to look at shares outstanding here. If AMD issues new shares, that doesn't raise or lower their actual revenue. 

Please quote exactly what of any of my comments you are arguing against, because it seems to me that you're making entirely irrelevant comments. Price/revenue/income per share isn't relevant in a discussion about the value of a company as a whole; it's only relevant to the value of a share, **which isn't being discussed in the comment chain that you're commenting on**.
lets get it bro
From what I've heard, it looks bad only if it's extremely short and repeated. So 2 years and 2 years and 3 years is okay. 4 years and 3 years and 6 months is okay. But then 1 year, 6 months, 5 months looks bad....but again, this advice probably will change depending on what job sector you are in!
thots like the pain though

I agree for the most part but I also think a large part has to do with supply and demand for the candidate pool. In low unemployment, high economic growth periods you don‚Äôt typically get dozens of super qualified candidates to pick the very best one to make an offer to. 

Now it‚Äôs also geographically dependent, but most of my recent offers I‚Äôve made have been ‚Äòwell they can probably do the job and should be okay‚Äô not ‚Äòhell yeah get this guy here ASAP let him loose on everything‚Äô. If I‚Äôm debating between multiple rockstars it‚Äôll be something that I‚Äôll consider bc I know I could get called out on it by my bosses or hr to at least discuss the reasoning and the risk of losing a lot of time and money invested into someone only being with the company a year or so.

Pain. And now at these levels I‚Äôm going all in üòÇüòÇ
I think you underestimate how hungry certain types of people are for travel and leisure. I remember reading a breakdown of summertime bookings, and the release in question (I forget if it was about an airline or other travel related thing) mentioned that summer is booked to fuck for them.
twiddled my fingers at 1.04 LOL. 

1,000 shades at 1.15... let‚Äôs ride
now the next step is making them mention our president u/deepfuckingvalue
Next level DD
I'm not an options guy. At some point this is going down. It's another Blockbuster situation.
All he has to do is mention clean energy
...why would top be in before shorts cover?
oh ye of little faith.
Lack of APHRIA comments today were dad. That motherfucker is up 21% on the day
Same
Sleepy joe probably meant 1 billion dollars. He‚Äôs so delusional
why
Not if you do it right. Effectively what you're doing is contributing to a tIRA (not taking any tax breaks for it because you don't qualify for them), and then converting the money immediately to Roth (which you're allowed to do). You'd pay taxes on any gains, but you wouldn't *have* any gains.
Grudgingly Dumping SPY 1dte calls for 20% loss an hour ago sure feels a lot better now...
Well anyways thanks for bringing it up cuz you reminded me to sell a NIO put with my spare cash
I'd honestly feel comfy with the January 2022 $45c
How many of you guys woke up this morning thinking, ‚ÄúFuck, I should have bought more at close...‚Äù Well, here we are again...

WTF HAPPENED WITH GOEV FUUUUUUUUU
amen to that
All hands on deck for $VALE
Why
I think it's good to diversify and I like and own shares in both of these companies. However, it seems you are insinuating that you have ALL of your capital tied up in GOEV, which I would advise against. Even if you went half and half, you will have ALL of your capital tied up into two VERY volatile SPACs (also not great). But high risk/ high reward. 

Ultimately I believe GOEV has more short term and long term potential. Go with your gut. Both are solid in my opinion. Good luck.
Hold my up 37% XOM $50c for 3/19 or sell for profits like the 28yr old boomer I am?

"What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Senseonics Holdings shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Senseonics Holdings is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Medical Info Systems industry that ranks in the Bottom¬† 6% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter"

I'll pass lol
Yup CRSR TSLA NIO and PLTR all red today

Fuck
 The options will have value across the day, i can't imagine a lot of people deciding to exercise at 9:30am. It's a possibility, but it's unlikely this will play a big role until the very end. I recommend you look at TSLA graphs because its the same type of situation and the same type of crowd. Should give a good comparison for what type of movements we can expect to see.

Anyway just one last advice do your own research about the matter. You should always confirm what other people tells you, dont just go with whatever someone said in reddit.

It will save you a lot of trouble
GM

Feels like the MMs really don't want GME over $40. This is annoying for my $40 calls that expire tomorrow.
$100 and if it drops back below $1, I might throw another $100 at it.  Still have all my bngo profits to lose!
Why
Well if you do stay in them. You‚Äôll end up losing a lot of money if you can‚Äôt stomach a risk.

Won't be anything for BIOL until later in the Spring. I sold it and betting more on TYME.
that‚Äôs 1000% growth.. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Zero shares to short implies the demand for shares is wicked high. So those holding shorts at this point are either hoping for the stock to dip tomorrow or just let their positions expire. Given the bullish sentiment of GME, it's likely these people stuck in their shorts will elect to buy shares, driving the price higher.

Damn. The squeeze really has only begun.
I shop renter's (and auto) every year. Renter's is an annual policy, while auto is every 6 months. 

I'm just too lazy to shop every 6 months. I did that early in my 20s, but I don't care enough anymore. Plus my current provider (Progressive) has been the cheapest every year anyway.

The cause is as important as the gains! This is a war!
AFRM is okay, I got in on the pump on dump with a few shares, when it was $95 by the time it reached the general public it sort of ruined the upside
Fully agree. My first job was all of the responsibility, none of the power or ability to make any changes. Every job since then has been better and better.
I got in anyway at $1.16 - hopefully this keeps climbing tomorrow. Just missed out on a little quick 10% jump at the end of the day though...
You know banks have compliance departments,  right? Banks will hire literally hundreds-thousands of people to make sure said bank is following the law
Makes more sense for GME to be at 50b than PLTR currently. That would be about 12.5 times P/S which is about the valuation of SQ and PYPL. Not impossible
Yea, but every time he says somethings in the millions, it‚Äôs always in the thousands. Numbers aren‚Äôt really his thing!

I have been making pretty good money on oil/energy and have a couple oil/energy etf's that have treated me very well. Even a lot of the electric generation that will be needed to power all those Tesla's will still require oil/gas. As it stands we still have power shortages going on, so it isn't like we need less of it. Unless Biden's administration has an aggressive plan for Nuclear plants, the renewables just aren't at the scale needed to make getting rid of oil practical. Even if he does choose to move on nuclear power, it will still take years to get those reactors online.
Keep buying GME shares, 5 minutes left!

My big tech companies really aren't doing well today. Are we predicting imminent regulations on them or is there a piece of news I missed?
The question you poses fundamentally assumes that the market can be timed. The simple answer is no. We could have a bull market for the next 50 years or we could have a huge crash next month. This year could be a huge bull market compared to the past, but a slow bull market compared to a hyper growth market over the next 15 years. Nobody knows and everybody has their own theories with evidence to back it up. 

At the end of the day, all you can do is dollar cost average and invest money as you're able and keep it in. 

There's no way to "do the math" because all mathematical models would have to use assumptions from the past. You may have heard the saying that past returns do not predict or promise future returns.
Didn‚Äôt this IPO yesterday? Went from 49 to 98 and stayed flat all yesterday and today is the day you fomo in?

It's already printing bro. Bears will try to drive them price to cover their shorts. Fuck them
Ohhh that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs dropping, I believe Twitter did the same, ig I should be fine
>more shares is less asset per share for existing owners

See my other comment. This is all not relevant at all.

>Lisa Sue and friends are giving themselves a lot of shares and insta selling them for profit

*Not only* not relevant, but also not true at all. She doesn't control how many shares she gets - that's set by the board, and diluting the shares only **hurts** her as she is both a holder of stock and her income is dependent on the increased price of said stock - meaning she would want to **decrease** shares outstanding and thus increase the price per share, making her options that she's paid in much more valuable.

You have this entirely backwards. You could not be more wrong. Please invest in ETFs until you have the basics figured out for your own good.
Just goes to show that no Market without Mango.
Thanks babe

Just maxed out my instant deposit on GME.
GME should do an offering at this price for sure. Can allow them to fix a lot of problems with cash faster and not be taking BK risk later.

I had a very good 2020, 100k is not a monster position for me. Just a significant bet.

There are so many unemployed people who just bet their life‚Äôs saving on GME to hit big over the next week. This is going to be an amazing blessing or a totally sad shitshow next week.
Here we go. Rocket is fuelled. Pre checks complete. I‚Äôm hyped.

Scheduled EOD fade for BABA
1.9 T is underwhelming
Almost every stock has worked out so far, especially over that time frame. Whether you picked something like Costco or if you went with Target, you've earned somewhere around 18% per year if we're simply looking back over your five year (2015 - present) time frame. If you decided to bet on more volatile items such as Netflix, Amazon, or Nvidia, you've been getting close to 50% per year for the past 5 years (or 70% in the case of Nvidia).

Keep in mind that the SPY has returned like 12.5% per year over that period as well, so a well-diversified investment plan has been successful too. 

The real risk for all of us is a prolonged drawdown period, where instead of volatile swings down and back up, we just slowly bleed down over a multi-year time frame, and then slowly climb back up over the next few years. Again, this hasn't happened since 2000, but I wouldn't rule it out as an impossibility (though I doubt that it will happen this year since we're in a zero percent interest rate environment for the near-term).
Lets get real here.  While u/DeepFuckingValue is on the moon, Ryan Cohen is on Mars.
can you smell that? I smell......fromunda cheese. UNWASHED UNCIRCUMCIZED SHREK DICK INCOMING ON GME
How do you sell shares above market price.... impossible?

For everyone who doesn't know, they will merge with AMD and anyone holding Xilinx will get 1.7234 shares of the merged company in the end, which means of the deal goes through you can make money üí∞ on this exchange ratio as you can currently get Xilinx at ~1.55 of the price of AMD
WOOF there it is WOOF there it is

I see now, I thought he meant that JP Morgan literally took stock from him and not just mad an analysis that caused the stock to dip. 
Thank you for the clarification!!
Oh yeah for sure, ive been on reddit long enough to know that. Im just getting into stocks and know next to nothing so I plan to do a lot of research before going in much

>NYT buy vs rent calc suggests buying is marginally better than renting an equivalent unit using conservative numbers (home appreciation at inflation, market at 8% returns). Buying is heavily favored if the housing market appreciates much above inflation.

This is the problem with these calculators; they give the illusion of emotion-free logical reasoning but the outcomes are completely dominated your wild guess at how much housing will appreciate.

It sounds like you want a house.  There is nothing special about home purchasing decisions compared to any other purchase.  Do you want it?  Do you know how much it will cost?  Are you comfortable with that trade-off?
Yay so I‚Äôm not a retard! This market is behaving somewhat rationally. Maybe? Who knows.
Three minutes to buy GME shares

GME

You will regret not buying

Huge pump incoming after hours
Thanks bro

What does that have to do with GME paying their employees like dog shit? That doesn‚Äôt sound like a great company to their employees. You do realize they don‚Äôt have to pay them the almost absolute bare minimum legally allowed right?
>  The more special interest and slush money in it, the less likely it will be to pass.

The more likely you mean right? All you need to do is buy off a few republicans, aren't there military bases to maintain somewhere?

Option have a value called delta. It determines how the option price changes with regard to the stock. For strikes near the current price(ATM: At The Money) , it's usually about 0.5 meaning for every dollar the stock goes up the option goes up $0.5.

It may very well, and I may see better prices then. And yes, I'm red for entering the trade too early. In my experience, these things suddenly start happen when they are happening. I'm pretty confident, so I want to be in the trade. I may enhance my position tomorrow AM. Remember though that I'd exit this position if tomorrow didn't dump, and the options have a week on them, so my var is not the full value.
Maybe I‚Äôm dumb, I‚Äôm in the red on every single steel call I‚Äôve put in. Biden needs to give a speech about infrastructure reform or something man.
Grats, close to $20k today?
Feels good seeing people still hopping into GME. Feels good to have been early at $13.31 a share. More to go!

I purchased 1 contract at 10 with an exp of 1/29 for $65..then purchased another contract at 15 with the same exp for $25. I've doubled on one of them already.

Do I exercise the option down the road or sell to close when I'm ready to take my gains

Literally last chance to buy GME. Everyone else, hold and prepare for tomorrow.
Bought some SPY 1/15 calls just now let's go Buyden
This initial push is based off of news that their preliminary sample mining produced encouraging results. Essentially they've proven that they have the goods to produce the quantity and quality of Manganese necessary. The endgame for this stock's potential is if they actually succeed in making a deal with Tesla or some other company for battery production. If you're banking on the latter, then this stock has a long way to go before it reaches its peak. I wouldn't count on it growing past .50 based on the recent news alone, though.
Still you, just lucky retarded

In other words, i blatantly betrayed you because my broker doesn't clear my stock money and my options money at the same time, so i have to sell stock today so i can buy options tomorrow.

Say I have 5k and want to buy dkng at $50. Normally, I‚Äôd set a limit order and leave it gtc. Wait for a red day sometimes it takes weeks. If I sell covered puts, the contract sells around $100. If it takes several weeks to exorcise, I‚Äôd gain that premium every week that I sell a put until it hits the $50 strike. You risk it dumping way past the strike of course, but who cares if you made theta while waiting.... man I think I‚Äôm theta gang now

Same brother, i need this to rescue my portfolio. When are you going to sell? 5mins into open?
Remindme! 74 days ARKX
I once had the same question as you.  Had a stock go up over 10,000% and I didn't want to sell.  Not ANY of it.  Thought I had the winning ticket and it was going to be smooth sailing from there.  

Welp.  It lost ALL of it's astronomical gains and went right back down to where it was.  Even left me with a little bit of a paper loss for a while.  I still hold that exact purchase, and it bumps along at a certain level, never going up or down that much.

I came to the conclusion that even though I was *massively* beating the average annual return of the S&P 500, I wanted more.  1,000% wasn't good enough for me.  10,000% wasn't good enough for me.  I wanted more.  My gut told me that in 5-6 months, it would be worth even more.  Sound familiar?

That, my friend, is what greed does to you.  You've been given the gift of free and easy money.  Lock in at least a little bit of a gain.  Maybe just 10% of your stake.
So are we anticipating BB to moon now or???

OMG
90% of the people here behaving as if they are the smartest and most successful are mostly people who got lucky. Many just copy social media or throw everything into one single thing (tech), it's just that in a bubble there is always one very obvious profitable move which will continue to work until the bubble pops.

In the long term, these lessens you make at the age of 18 will turn out to be really cheap. The mistakes I made leasing me to lose 200‚Ç¨ at 18 help me now to be more cautious at the right moment because I have actually experienced losses which where hurtful (at that time).

Just.don't forget that as long as you have so little money and are so young, investing in your human capital will give you a much better ROI over time. If investing starts to lead you procrastinating in your studies, it is time to just throw everything into a World ETF or S&P500 and stop caring until you have a job and money to play around with.
Huge speculation right now however bb isn't just a cellphone company. They sold some phone patents yesterday because they ain't just a phone company. The stock could be worth 30 bucks by end of the year, depending how things go.

really hard to say. In doomsday scenarios, it's better to just sell now then BTFD. In modest selloffs where the narrative stays in place, it wont matter to stay long as you say.

Hi from australia, I did my part by grabbing 100 shares on the open and writing a covered call ($48 expiring tomorrow for $2 premium).
Lost 4K on GME today lol
Hi

Why does pltr hate me!

This is the best write up I've seen on GME in the last few days. Completely explains the last few days of buying (mm's hedging for tomorrow, around 10m shares I'd guess) and shows potential price action based on solid dd. I'm gonna diamond hands this bitch SS is still to come. 

Thanks a lot for your post, much appreciated.

Wait. Why the hell would ITM calls drive the price up?
Close enough. No idea what we'll see tomorrow but I'm diamond handing GME no matter what
The moment of truth!
Well I can‚Äôt say if it‚Äôll make you rich. All I can say is that I see it as a long term, conditional on cryptos keeping their run, which I think they will until at least the end of this year. 

There are also a few things happening atm that could be good for Argo. It just got up listed to OTCQB, making it easier to trade for Americans, and making it a little more likely that big money comes it too. They are also increasing the size of their mining fleet around beginning-mid February.

The company‚Äôs management also seems good and who knows maybe in a few months it‚Äôll get uplisted onto the Nasdaq, which will make it much more likely to get big money buying in.
Zomedica, they actually might be legit if you into penny stocks. Not like a full YeetYolo like us Autists
I have a guy who does it for me every year.  They're called 'agents' I think.

&#x200B;

(I'm being snarky, but its pretty awesome.  I used to try and do it all myself but these days I don't have the time so I just occasionally get an email from Mark like "hey if we switch you to XYZ company you'll save $300" and I'm like "make it so".)
APHA shares will transform into .83 TLRY shares each. Currently APHA shares cost .63  what a TLRY share is worth. Therefore you are getting a whole extra .2  TLRY share for free when the merger completes.
Pls
great job everyone thanks

Here this kind of breaks it down. Not sure I want to sell covered calls though.
Personally, I want to make the US version of OHB at some point
Don't buy the GBTC. Just buy the coins themselves. You're paying a massive premium (like 17%) just to have somebody buy and store one asset for you. It's actually not that hard to buy and hold crypto so that premium will cause GBTC to crash as soon as there's a real crypto ETF.
Come on sleepy Joe. Pump that ICLN and MJ tonight.
AH dump means nothing. 50 EOW
BLACKBERRY IS BACK LIKE IT'S 2003!

Hopefully actually making money.
As long as APHA is below 17% of TLRY, it is better to buy APHA (arbitrage opportunity since each APHA stock will be 0.83 TLRY stock)

in monkey language: if you think TLRY is going to  **üöÄ**  then buy APHA.

GME attacked with a giant mace on the bell.

Shrugged it off.
Realistically, what can Melvin do to hedge their shorts? Surely they are not just hoping the stock goes down fast enough for the interest not to burn them?
Another day, another 13% of my account gone. Thanks Tim Apple

It will only take a few institutional investors selling and taking profits. That will cause a chain reaction of algos and boomers stop-loss orders triggering like a domino effect

Before you start buying in the first day of the crash, remember that it took 15 years for the market to come back to the 2000 levels. It could take even longer this time

Alright sleepy joe, you know what to do now
Sir, this is a casino.
SAME FUCK
Already 1.15M volume AH on GME
Not me üíé üôå
YESSIRR
the number hasn't even been unveiled
The question is: what does the peak of the squeeze look like?
If you fulfill the requirements and pass a test, you get a PE license and almost guaranteed promotion/title change and raise. If you don't get those things, you almost certainly go to a company that gives you those things. It's a pretty standard thing in the industry. It has some more responsibility but not necessarily a significant amount.
i heard he's talking about GME
Bought a amzn 1/15 3200c lotto at close. Im so poor idk why i did it im a fucking degenerate
Big bois holding it down for themselves for after-hours

Anything that you can use to add rockets in front of a ticker to
thanks a lot guys. Holding on. love you.
I made $0.28 today.  


Obviously I wasn't in on GME today.
It broke $40 twice today, just hold. It'll hit $60 tomorrow before market close.
someone better find jack ma soon so i can kill him myself
yep, all forms of this happened, the question is how much is naked short options that were in turn quickly hedged with equity. I'm estimating 90%. Maybe its 95%. Maybe it's 70% maybe it's 50%. But it's significant no matter what it is.
I'm sure most addicts find a way to get their fix no matter the damage is causes to their life.
Man the harpoons!

 \+$8.52 (+27.13%) Today  GME  


Damn
AMD is just fueling up for its next run. I believe in you!
What is behind the GME surge?
I bought 1 44c
I'm broke so I can only afford one BB contract. 12.5c on 1/22
How did u calculate the value of these stocks?
I like to own a few amount of stocks where i know the business.
For example a small game company where i can calculate sales and profit numbers from their upcoming games.
This way my discounted cash flow are quite accurate in the short term.
If your valuation of the company is lower and u really believe in it and their product, u should hold long term.


I dont know to much about Nio , but their valuation is close to Toyota.
This worries me since i would not expect them to sell as many cars as Toyota.
Also the worry is an highly competitive market and a Chinese brand.
Many world wide see Chinese products as inferior since many flawed products come from there.
I work in the car business and Chinese cars a big no due to them becoming valueless very quickly.
So it would take time for them to change this imagine.

I do love Tesla a lot, i have been a fan for many years.
And they plan to become a battery business.
The factories are the product according to Elon Musk.
They want to produce 3 THW of battieres in 2030.
At 50 dollar per kwh that is 150 billion in revenue and at 100 it is 300 billion.
Then you would get the revenue from the car manufactering.
Plus the self driving car software which is highest margin.
Ans the taxi software they would use.
So if you believe Elon musk you can derive the cash flows from that and make ur calculation.
But remember it could also not pan out the way Elon wants.

And diversification can be good if you think these stock are overvalued or could have a drop.
But only with stocks u know are undervalued of course.
Not pure for the diversifacation.

One problem that i see is, that there seems to be am EV bubble.
Even for companies that have no future for profitablity.
So thats why u should be wary.
-$432 for the day.

I've got a shit load of GME calls expiring tomorrow 1/15.  $5k in total.

23x $50

5x $49

5x $55

1x $45

Practically everyone who rents a car...usually the only time I ever listen to XM or Sirius
MORE HOLD = MORE MONEY
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHY GME IS GOING UP OTHER THAN AUTISTIC PUMPS!?? 

I mean I love it but I want the logical side of my brain to stop bugging me
Keep selling OTM calls, I think near term it‚Äôs going to consolidate
Waiting on Daddy Biden to pump ICLN with all the stimmys.
I see a beautiful stimmy and a brilliant people rising from this abyss.
   
I see the stocks for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy.
   
I see that I hold a GME share in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence.
   
It is a far, far better moon that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better tendies that I go to than I have ever known.
I think if this ER beats and they go positive we ride to Valhalla

Closed my GME 1/15 33c EoD. Rolled some into 1/29 40s, used profits to buy 200 shares to hold.
Picked up a 2/5/21 10.5c last week for 0.04 and I'm loving this rocket. If Tesla holds then I think it pulls up Ford and GM hard.
Oh, I‚Äôm not doubting that, but I think there‚Äôs some probably more pressing matters that get handled first before we start legalizing pot. It‚Äôs not if, it‚Äôs when. I‚Äôm in on tilray leaps at 10c bought before the new year.

I think big alcohol should be worried, because this is their next big competitor.
Thank you so much for all this can‚Äôt thank you enough
Went in big at 3:59 for GME.  Lets hope it pans out.

Europoors better not dump GME üòê
LETS GO GME!! TOMORROW WE FEAST!! KEEP GOING!!
Please TAN recover

Melvin might try to drive the price down AH with little volume. I wouldn't trust it.
You're so right I am a üêª at 40
22 average. Still holding cuz I love money
Where at
400k shares GME bought at close

100k sell wall at 40
What‚Äôs up with GOEV?
106k sell wall at $40 goddamn
My wife and I have a joint bank account ever since getting married. I still have around $10k in my old savings account from when I was single (separate bank) that is basically just sitting there. We want to know what os the best way to invest that 10k to make our money grow for us. 

We are both in our very late 20s.

We are both employed full time making around 90k combined.

We both have 401ks through our jobs, but I don't know if they match dollar for dollar

Our objectives with this money are simply to make it grow. It can take 10 years, 20 years, or 30 years for all we care, we just want it to grow so we can have a comfortable retirement, maybe buy a house at some point, and leave a nice inheritance for our future kids.

Our time horizon is more long term. 20+ years at least

No current holdings. All our wealth is in our 2 bank account that I already mentioned. We don't own property or anything like that.

Big debts: around $100k in student loans. Currently on a 10 year payment plan. Just over $1000/mo for payments. Idk the interest rate, it's my wife's. 

As far as other relevant info, we would be more interested in a passive, long-term approach ('set and forget'). Not opposed to something more active, but I wouldn't wanna have to be checking every day or treating it like a second job. If it was more a monthly thing, that wouldn't be too bad. 

We figure now is a good time since a lot of stuff is still lower than it was pre-pandemic, though we definitely realize we should have started back in march. Any help is appreciated.
LETS GO GME YOU FUCKING GET THEM BOY
That‚Äôs the thing. FB has by far the most profitable business model, far superior to snap and Twitter. I‚Äôm not super bullish on the growth of snap and twitters monetization going forward. I don‚Äôt think they will ever reach fbs level, just because of the essence of the platforms. 
Therefore, I don‚Äôt see snap or Twitter as very interesting growth investments. 

And as I said FB has the makings on paper as a really great and undervalued stock but there is something about it that has cursed it to lag. Some will say it‚Äôs the threats of government regulation and a potential breakup, imo it has more to do with the fact that most people seem to absolutely hate FB and their business practices. Therefore, in the day of ESG investing (Environmental, Social, Governance) they will always lag.
$35.75... fucking GOEV and ICLN man
Good work everyone. The fire rises tomorrow
nobody gives a fuck GTFO
You idiots convinced me to buy ICLN calls don‚Äôt let me down
Now, don't wait til spring
Alibaba is getting into EV as well...
Im all in on GME but you need to watch out for cloud gaming because its growing fast, and now that its in the interest of Google and many megacorporations to give people fast, cheap, accesible internet cloud gaming could pose a threat to GME long term.

Yes, it‚Äôs a valid strategy. Note that he was a Vice-President at DE Shaw before Amazon, so he knows what he‚Äôs talking about. Your volatility will be much higher, but if you can stomach the drops, you‚Äôre going to be better off in the long run.
You got no clue what I‚Äôm talking about unfortunately it seems. No part of what I said was referencing the stock. It was an attempt to help you understand the deep dogmatic hinderances of thought you allow yourself to perceive life through due to your ideological thinking
Can you not option trade ah?
Why should we hate on you?  You've already shown you hate yourself.
So if it hits 40 after hours do the calls still count?
Just saw this. Unfortunately trading212 doesn‚Äôt do post and pre market trading and my order 2 minutes before market close didn‚Äôt go through. Seems like a good play will be watching it tomorrow

You're welcome and no problem. Happy to do it.
Growth doesn't apply that much to NEE as it does to other smaller companies (considering it's high PE and actual market share that it can still take in North America). It is not like the population of the US will double or NEE will invest in another large sized country.
Possible if merger happens. If not we're screwed.

This scale is likely ranging from TIPs as 1 to emerging markets as 5. I don‚Äôt think Vanguards scale includes WSB yolo‚Äôs.
That's why I asked the question in this thread. Guaranteed rate said they didn't care where the money came from.

Double king today damn!
TDA‚Äôs P&L % is kinda messed up. They mark it against the price of the options, not the capital at risk (margin). If you really made 75% your account would be much higher than $100k. I suggest you (mentally) mark profits against your maximum loss (i.e. the margin locked by the open position.)

Check out https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/

If you really want to learn and you use Robinhood, this video is as good as it gets:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms

You should really be thinking of options as just that, options. You are paying a **premium** to buy a **contract** which gives you the option to **buy 100 shares** at the desired **strike price** anytime from now until the **expiration date**. You can **exercise** this option at anytime, or you can sell the contract back for a profit/loss.

But yes, it's essentially a "bet." I think that video explains all you need to know. Watch it in chunks so you don't overwhelm yourself.

Man you lost me so hard at Emmy award winning Cuckmo.
No I'm still holding it. The market value of 500 shares is less than $20 now. That one crashed hard. I don't think that one is coming back. I think there were a couple more that I sold for +/-10%, nothing notable. I completely missed the moment they had that year. 

Yea Marijuana stocks seem like they are rough lately. I was looking at some ETFs and they were down too. I have been keeping an eye on Planet 13 since they seem decent and are headquartered in my city but have not bought anything yet.
Hoes mad
Sold what i could and threw most of it into ICLN... please biden please dont fuck this up
Is there any other way to do stockers

Because in order to execute that option, you have to actually have the money to purchase those stocks, which most autistics retards here, do not, so they sell the option under the total value such that someone else will buy and exercise the contract.

The reason why you would want to buy options instead of stocks is that you can buy "the right" to buy a LOT more stocks vs if you just bought stocks in the first place, giving you a lot more return when you sell that option.
When you retards are right you are right...this is gonna benefit a lot of us.
Expecting a further dip tomorrow

No
simply bullish
Look at the short data lmao.

Only 40k shares to borrow with a 46% borrow rate 

Yah bro. Hasn‚Äôt even squeezed yet.
You finally sold the calls!!! Great work man, really big fan.
I am ready to work GME all...year...long.
If anyone with enough dedication could make 30% every 2 months, they‚Äôd quadruple their portfolio every year.
That trend for 10 years is about 69,000 x your money back.

Please be careful, this market is not normal, and you cannot and should not expect to make that big a return consistently. You‚Äôre likely investing in high risk stocks, which are just as likely to crater at some point.


Congrats on the gains though!
IM GONNA GUSHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
90% of shopping still done in store üöÄüöÄüöÄ
What a piece of shit day
I watched that baby drop in at 4pm on the dot.
noooooo TLRY dont die AH
GME and BB looking great for tomorrow
What do you see
Generally you want to buy a call weeks to months out from its expiration date, not the day before. You may be able to sell the contract tomorrow just because of how nuts GME is rn, but in the future you‚Äôll loose money on a play like that 99/100 times.
What‚Äôs this now? High today was $41
My wife is waiting!!!
I LOVE YOU üíéüôå

I stuck it in dry to BB today. All GME gains will go to BB after the squeeze has been completed tomorrow.

Plz god just one more 20%+ day and I‚Äôll be a happy man

You're right, seems like it's not as cut and dry as I thought. They do have best results in the NHTSA tests, even if that doesn't necessarily mean they're the safest under all circumstances.

That said, Googling "safest car" is a terrible source, as all the top hits are car magazines and websites which are always doing paid reviews. They're about as neutral as your average Capitol-storming republican commenting on Trump's actions.

This is exactly what happens.

I think you have the right idea of having more concentrated holdings. That said, 5k-10k is a decent mark to build a new position in another sector

MY LEIGE
GME
New to investing, just kind of putting around with a small amount of cash and a small portfolio. Trying to learn ins and outs of short term investing(2-5 years). I have some long term ETF's which I'll buy periodically. 

Today, I have a question about a certain circumstance.

I have 10 shares of Aphria that shot up 25% after their earnings report. In this instance, would it be wise to:

* Sell for 25% profit and rebuy when hype dies.
* Hold and invest more when hype dies.

The whole basis around investing in them is that they may be very profitable in the growing cannabis industry. My gut says hold, because cannabis isn't going anywhere and the price may only increase going forward. My gut may also be very, very wrong.

Thanks friends!
Are you familiar with the concept of renting?
Be very careful with who you take advice from. Most people lose money in the markets as do the majority of day traders. 

Diversification at your age is a mistake. Ignore that. You should be building wealth and you do that by concentrating. You can diversify later when its time to protect your gains.

GME - $49 call, but it's going to fucking 60 baby lets fucking goooooooooo
You dropped this  üëë
What's your logic for closing OSTK?
Few thoughts for ya:

First, do you know what IV is? If so, think about what it was when you bought and what it is now and why that happened (look at the chart right up to where you bought in and then what happened after). If not, learn about IV and see above.

Second, think about the theta you're going against (same as above, if you deal with options you -must- understand IV and theta) with a Jan 15 call this far out of the money.

I say this stuff not be an ass or anything, but because I murdered myself last year doing the same types of plays as you and I've now learned how much more important it is to save for those LEAPs (also so you can synthetic covered call and sell the pop for a nice diagonal spread). Just some thoughts, but I would imagine your assessment of selling those contracts on open is probably wise, although honestly you may find no buyers. Good luck out there man, and keep learning about options, it gets better!
Just a shit ton of sell orders at a certain price that needs to be boight up for price to go above. There was one at GME 39.50ish candles keep bouncing off it
GET BACK IN you still have time its early days
The dilution typically comes when companies are trying to raise capital.
Not exactly; many other countries (even entire *continents*) have the government encouraging investing & speculation.  All of Europe prints money/quantative easing.  They've even had negative interest rates, which means you need to pay the bank to leave your money there.  Not even 'Murica' does that.  Heck, we don't even have 0% rates.  Pretty close, as they're "0 - 0.25%"
Did you learn a lesson?
lol no, squeeze of all squeezes
Getting in on BB now is like getting in on the early days of the internet.
is that Biden on lemonparty.com
So is TLRY
Mods?
Can't remember the last time I was this leveraged to the tits. Probably last Monday. New year same me.
I am greeeeeeen
I am down to my last $100 that my bitch ex wife didn‚Äôt take in child support. Gods of WSB shine some light on me and help me make some fucking tendies please. I need to show my ex-wife boyfriend my PP is actually not smol. Give me üíé‚úãüèΩ

(Gonna YouTube options now. Yolo)
I am appalled that this sub and others managed to make BB moon.
Watch ELY rise, maybe some bbby
if youre a UK or EU citizen i can share some great ETFs for you, or you can find the US equivalents
Tomorrow might just be a dream maker. A ton of FDs on GME for Stim + more squeezing. 

Going to be hard to sleep tonight!
Obviously he bought at the top retards
Because that was the way of investing in the past and people regurgitate the same boomer advice

Broad index investing is fine but why be comfy with 7% annual growth when you can do 50% instead 

There's never been a better time for stock picking
Yes, because it‚Äôs only concentrated in one country, one continent, one currency, the big companies like Apple are way over weighted as a risk, the US stock market may has outperformed other markets for a time but past performance is not indicator for future performance and the increasingly unstable political situation with socialism/anti capitalism from the left leaning democrats. Only true Americans invest 100% in the S&P 500
CDU lefties ? Are you retarded ?
That's not a good option for me, but thanks for the advice.
I want and need BB to 10$ by open
Oh shit blue origin human flight by April üëÄüëÄ
Is it financially irresponsible if I invest in a call debit spread with only 2k. I can't possibly cover 100 shares of stock in the event of assignment. Also, if I am assigned, will I go into massive debt or will Robinhood just exercise the buy call and leave me to pay the difference. Also, can I avoid this risk but closing a CDS a week or two in advance of the expiration date? Thanks for the help mate.
How can you not trust the guys running the company. That‚Äôs all the DD I NEED

"We've seen this play out, it's a bit shit"

> So a homeless person with no assets, but $100,000 in the S&P.

It's quite conceivable for somebody to live at home with parents and put every penny that they earn into investment accounts.

Does the math not add up?  Do you not think that a stock market crash ruins people's lives?  Destroys families?  The S&P dropped 30%, but what about individual stocks? 

I think we're getting off topic here, so I'll ask again:  Does losing 1/3 of your net worth in less than 60 days seem risky?
This is the "Avengers Endgame" equivalent of this series. Bravo.
You made me look at what it started at.

What a day to end up close to even lol.

Means there's another battle to happen.

Jumped the gun at the open, but that beautiful bastard gained it all back
Tomorrow tech will lead and IWM will drill.
Buy the BBs for Friday:

BB

BBY gonna surprise at earnings

BBBY gonna squeeze.

GME finish the squeeze.
I mean, good luck and I hope you're right BUT... Gamestop is a place where parents and other relatives go to buy games for gamers. And, not only is there a definite trend AWAY from physical game copies by the console makers of the world, there are now mounting reasons why nobody wants to go to a retail store.
 Plus, if you happen to be a gamer, then you'll already know how shitty Gamestop is for buying and selling games.
This guy secretly shadow stalks WSB, saw the GME DD over the last few months, and is pissed with envy that he didn‚Äôt buy and is missing the rocket ship. That‚Äôs all this is.

Do you know what‚Äôs IV?
Next week
I know this is heresy, but is anyone planning on buying GME puts when the decline inevitably occurs?
Hell yeah brother.
Hard to argue with that, honestly. But I already made back my principal and re-invested. Now it‚Äôs time to okay aggressive with House money.
not only that but...damn apparently I can get Tesla WAY cheaper soon then lol

The AH movement on GME is a spoof. 

Institutional investors are trying to paint the chart AH by selling what few shares they do have in an attempt to dictate sentiment tomorrow. 

Don't buy into this. MM's are getting absolutely fucked by retail on this one, and the only way they get out with their shirts is if we give them some breathing room. 

**Hold.**

I have like $2.5k total in GME

if it go tits up, I'll survive because I make more than that per paycheck and have plenty of boomer shit. it's fun to be on this ride though. worried about the people who borrow like 10k and cash out 401k to invest based on retards on wsb. this is prob why i won't be an overnight millionaire, but i'm also not gonna be living in a cardboard box because some mem stock tanked

I think I would just withdraw 4% every year. I want to open a VN bank account so I can avoid the 30% tax, but I have looked into it and it seems like Finnish government can track when I buy & sell ETFs so they can tax it as Finnish-source income. You have been a big help! Thank you so much!
But let's be honest, would you have bought $5 shares then ignored them til now? I wouldn't have been patient enough.
5/5 is for sector funds like energy

The whole market could be mooning, but energy might still be down in a year. It's riskier
It's not going down tomorrow so you're fine lol

As a newbie here looking to invest $2000 on a new stock every day (buy - sell); are the most active trending tickers something I should consider in searching for opportunities?

Thanks for the help!!
GME will single handedly bring back my account. Up 20k past week but still down 27k. We ride to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
I was foolish and set a stop loss order, price dipped for a second, my shares sold and then immediately gme goes up again
Congrats!!
if OP is correct and this thing doubles repeatedly, aren't you making a ridiculous amount of money for little investment on like 1x 1/22 $55c? 

it's like $220 to profit thousands if it really does double each day.

FYI - I don't full understand options besides the general concepts and looking at the profit payout charts at certain prices.

He closed the calls!  Added another $2-million in a day!
A true autist to notice that, respect

Now pray Biden says something nice on EV/Clean Energy and I buy GME shares tomorrow.
I also have some funds in ETFs, but I also invest in Companies I believe in, like AMD or CRWD/JKS and NET.

Absolutely. There's no logical way that this inflated bubble can grow further. Keep your cash ready. There will be amazing discounts soon
This doesn‚Äôt look like a ‚Äúdip‚Äù. It looks more like a sector rotation to beat down value stonks.

If China never has a chance of surpassing the U.S., why is everyone crying about the need to contain China? 

Why is every politician, think tank member, and media guru calling China a ‚Äústrategic competitor‚Äù, ‚Äúrevisionist power‚Äù, ‚Äúrival‚Äù, ‚Äúbiggest threat to America‚Äù etc.?

Fact is that China has been the world‚Äôs largest economy since 2014 ‚Äî measured by purchasing power. Take it from Fox News (2014 article):

https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-surpasses-u-s-to-become-largest-world-economy

In nominal GDP, China will surpass the U.S. by 2028 or before

I think that's mainly because anyone can just pull up zillow and see.

Oof
Is the price move still due to 10 year bond yields?

Fucking AAPL go to $135 already you autist cucks
I would do at least 30 to spread the risk at this level
Love this. Makes more sense than GME
That's just for the shares and the April calls. Including the Jan $20 calls he sold today, he gained about $2.5m.
My SRAC shares are printing nicely.

Sold to cover up the initial put in and riding the rest into orbit
BB

The prophesy will be fulfilled, we go to +$40 next week
What the move? Shares? 

I've seen a few argue 13c leaps
I've been holding for a while
oh my fucking god
Profit taking and paper hands
nope!
I have a strange syndrome, I think there's scientific name for it. When tuning volume on TV I always go for digits that end with either 5 or 0, like 25 or 30 but never 27 as that is 'not round enough number'.

Same goes for stocks. When I please a buy order and I see stock might come down and now is $26.33 for example, I'll always submit an order for $26.00. That is some strange fuckery. Already missed couple of golden opportunities to buy ARKG last week for ~$94.
It closed at $50 in mine.

 Not a GME bro but I‚Äôm happy for my GME bros. Been long IWM for awhile and I just don‚Äôt see a reason to fix something that‚Äôs not broken. Maybe I‚Äôll dump profits in GME eventually. Idk. I just love seeing you guys win.
holy fuck totally forgot... my life is meaningless

I don‚Äôt know the answer which is why I‚Äôve never made a purchase.

it is just hype on the new ARK found that doesn't exist yet.
I love you man! Got in at $4.40!!!!
Spy calls at close were free right?
Gme gonnna dump ü§£
Jokes aside, how do we know the squeeze hasn‚Äôt started yet
Looks like it yeah still at 50k shares. Did not exercise
Do you know what you're talking about? I don't but I'm wondering if you don't either. From what I have seen, delta hedging is based on the delta of the option. So if a MM sells a call, they have taken a bearish position and they would short sell the stock, or sell offsetting puts. And vice versa. 

If they do buy or sell shares to hedge options, it's only up to the delta of that option. For example, they would only buy or sell 21 shares to hedge an option position that has a delta of .21, which makes sens because that option only moves 21 cents from a $1 move of the underlying.

Do you know which options are being sold and bought by MMs versus private buyers that aren't hedging? Or which are hedging by shorts or others with equity positions? I just don't know how you're extrapolating from limited info.
It‚Äôs a short squeeze, since there is so many institutions shorting the stock, institutions are inadvertently causing the stock to run higher since you have to purchase the stock in order to short it initially.

Since there was a catalyst of gaming consoles that initially shot the price of the stock high initially, shorts were forced to cover their positions. 

Then retards like us got our hands on it and pushed the stock price through the roof. Puts and calls are both pushing the price higher and higher
Yes
Can somebody explain what we are doing with Melvin i dont completly understand it

All in GME shares sometime before the bell tomorrow
what call did you have
Based on your post, it sounds like you‚Äôre rather new with investing. I‚Äôm basing this largely off of the fear, lack of due diligence, and the question in general. Assuming that I am correct, does your line of ‚Äú...it‚Äôs worked well so far...‚Äù apply mainly to stock decisions in roughly the past 9 months? If so, I would strongly urge you to recognize that the gains experienced post-covid dip are not typical. You could‚Äôve bought stock in a company that sells cow manure and you‚Äôd likely be up. Ultimately, it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre investing, but I strongly urge you to learn how to properly do your due diligence on a company to remove some of the emotional turmoil you experienced.
Seems like QCLN
I hate this phrase so much.

I brought PLTR puts into today because of this bear flag which did resolve lower.

There is now also an ascending triangle formed from the lows which could not break to the upside.

No position, but it likely goes lower yet again: https://imgur.com/a/RsXLpIU
Oh I made a big mistake at the end of the trading session; but I was lucky.  

Sometimes when the market is choppy I'll reverse my position by doubling the units bought or sold, so like with /ES I'll originally go long +5 and then if I feel it's finished its run and is about to turn back, I'll put in an order to sell -10.  This works when I'm right on top of things and I can make $$ on some of those big swings and just close my position if the price carries to far past my transition point.

Anyway, that works great when you're on top of your positional direction.  So I was -5 /ES at 3:48 and at 3:51 I thought the movement was going to turn, so I \*\*thought\*\* I bought +10 but I actually sold -10, which put me at -15 /ES contracts until I realized it by seeing my profit go up while the market was going down.  I nearly crapped my pants, by the time I put my buy +15 in I was freaking out that we could have a massive green candle slam in just before close which would wreck me, which kinda did happen, but I was already flat by that point.

Some lessons are best learned the easy way, like this one... whew.
Haha, me too man! All fuckin day.

You don‚Äôt have to have 100 shares to sell. Look up poor man‚Äôs covered call. You basically buy a deep itm leaps and then you can sell otm calls that have a shorter expiration.

And yeah buying cheap options is absolute shit. It‚Äôs cheap but u almost are guaranteed to lose all the money you put in. If you‚Äôre in Robinhood check if you can get to level 3 which allows you to trade spreads

It‚Äôs unreal how well timed the 1/15 calls were. There‚Äôs no way anyone would have believed this if he hadn‚Äôt been posting the position for months
No clue if he made any claims. I wasn't following his livestream. He's either going to sell those based on the reply from OP that it would be out of his cash on hand to purchase those shares (unless he had millions already stored in his bank) so it's much more beneficial for the cause for a run-up and sell then purchase shares if the supposed dip occurs.
I think you're underestimating the moving force of the sub. I get that it can seem impossible given how much Gamestop was talked about outside of the sub before the squeeze, but there's plenty of other examples where literally the only explanation is WSB money. Idk if you were around for Lumber Liquidators, but the only explanation for that pump was WSB. Finally, it really doesn't matter if the real movement comes from WSB money, or other people's money based on WSB as it achieves the same goal.

Yeah that's absolutely true. But do you think a run up could continue? The banks are bullish on it, obviously they do what they can to try to pump it.

I waited a bit to establish a career before having kids.  I'm so sorry I did that.  Sometimes it's not as easy or quick as you expect to actually have kids.  Always it's easier to keep up with the high energy needed for raising kids when you are younger rather than older. 

We were able to buy ourselves better vacations and fancier toys, but those are so unimportant in the grand scheme of things.  I think we gave them a good childhood, but I wished I had been younger when doing it.  I think I would have enjoyed it even more and been better able to engage.

Sorry man not trying to talk you down, I just watched so many people run head first into it because someone posted a $4 PT.

Their Covid stuff is WAY off so you‚Äôll be looking at the fibromyalgia drug short term. Their cash runway is less than a year so you‚Äôll be looking for an exit opportunity soon before they dilute. 

Hopefully someone will want that drug and then it will raise it enough for you to leave with some profit. 

This is of course unless you are happy to leave it for later in the year when they might get a bump from approval for human Covid testing.
Yeah i had aprils and julys but i got into feb just cuz i am thinking we will see more big moves soon. Can always roll em out

He straight up didn‚Äôt have the cash to exercise them all at the time
You didn't bring up PE or diversification across multiple stocks as an argument to evaluate levels of risks. You used ATH as a measurement of risk. And that's simply wrong. Even gold the most stable haven is only 5% down from its ATH. Does that mean gold is risky?
want to have. 

If you see a stock you want to buy, and it has options, write the put option wherever you feel comfortable

Right now the bid on the $42 Jan 29 put for HRL is $0.15.

If you buy 100 shares right now, it'll cost you $4,397

if you write the put, two things can happen:

1) the underlying drops to where the put is ITM and your new entry price is the price you get assigned on the 100 shares, $4200, less the premium you wrote, $15. so your entry price is $4,185. had you just straight up bought 100 shares, you'd be down more than $200

2) it doesn't go down and you collect on the premium you wrote, $15

this works well for dividend stocks because they tend to be range-bound because of the very fact that they're dividend stocks
both.

Ok. So I expect someone on the wrong side of a large set of options might want to do this to prevent the options from assignment?

Selling 100k stocks might be better than being assigned 5000 put options which would be 500k shares. Am I on the right track?

Does this imply that there is substantial organic upwards pressure?
It‚Äôs way up .... think I missed it... I‚Äôll put a limit order and hope it takes

I think you should hold until Tuesday at the earliest, the long weekend hype should be huge!
I would assume whoever makes the calls averages the bets out like bookies, profit on both ends for them and a reward for the better if right, but when both sides added up it doesn‚Äôt total 1.
so do we buy GME or blue apron?
Lez be honest. They dumped this to buy calls on the cheap. How could we not pump on a larger stimulus. Market has wanted this for a long time
If anyone wants to talk GME private message me

How much did you pay for the calls?
well it depends, if it squeezes properly it can go into the hundreds, it could also fizzle out into the 20s again. Depends on our luck. I think this is a good gamble overall.
Honestly, I hope GME skyrockets to $60 and I get called away and you make bank as well
Pretty positive this, JPM, and C are gonna print tomorrow

What stopped you from just waiting and executing? Was selling the option worth more than the 100x(price-12)? I'd figure you'd want to wait to be sure where the peak was and execute on the downslide, as long as it's still above what you spent on the stocks.

I'm counting on end of lock up period, mid february. But I also thought GME mooning wouldn't be for another month so what the fuck do I know (still holding)
I mean the market isn‚Äôt *entirely* disembodied from the economy. How is there zero connection between the best economy in the world and the top 25% of the international market? It‚Äôs not by chance that these companies were born in the US. I‚Äôm not making a political argument, just pointing out that these things don‚Äôt happen in a vacuum. 

It‚Äôs not that the market has *nothing* to do with the economy. Saying it *isn‚Äôt* the economy doesn‚Äôt make obsolete any and all connection between the two.
I don't have the stomach to hold for 3 days while the world burns around us. Too much time for apocolyptic news to screw up my gains.
There‚Äôs something real distasteful about people calling for more price jumps, even after a huge run up of their stock. Seeing such blatant displays of greed make me question whether people are truly good at heart. If the direct cause of all of humanity‚Äôs suffering clearly resides inside all of us, do we even have hope for a better future?

Why yes, I did miss the GME run. Why do you ask?
Nvm was glitched for a sec

The merger they did with Tilray isn't in our favor stock split wise. But they will be one of the largest weed companies after this merger. IMO you'll see a bit of a dip after the merger and then we should see steady growth.

Selling 1/15 55C was probably free money. Ended at 0.55 with -0.47 theta. Unless GME gaps up to around 50 at open, 55C will be dead by 9:31.

Not sure, it's looking like a snack though. I'm hoping some of my GME gambles pay off more and I'm going all in on Jan 29 calls. There's no way it doesn't run hard next week.

The antitrust shit is overblown. It would end up at the Supreme Court before any of these companies get broken up.

Changes to how they use, store and allow us to access our data I'm sure is coming, but that isn't going to have some catastrophic effect on the price.

I asked a friend who used to do HFT MM work on futures options, and he said he thinks most of these are hedged by a dealer. 

When they sell the initial option, they hedge at the delta. But they then hedge as the price changes (gamma hedging) which maintains delta \* shares exposed = hedge. As we near expiration, delta converges to 1 or 0 for most options unless very close to the money.

I always seem to miss this stuff by setting a limit order and missing it by a penny or two. I set this for $1 after the quick dip below and it kept creeping so I said screw it and bought at $1.05 market price. Glad I paid that extra $50 for my 1000 shares haha
To be honest, no solid price target on this one. I may just end up holding onto this one for the long-term and periodically check in on it. Price targets show it's right around fair value right now, but I foresee a lot of growth for them in the coming year or two.

I read their 10K (https://ir.onestopsystems.com) and liked seeing how they've positioned themselves to support industries that are now needing to handle substantial data processing tasks. Page 6 of the 10K breaks down these industries and the makeup of their various business segments.
Dude wtf

Worth backing Intel if your in for a long term  HOLD investment. Their chips are turning the corner and Pat is proven at VMware.

Absolutely do not listen to anyone saying he is not. Firstly there are thousands of companies still running traditional Data Centres with VMware having around 65% marketshare. A lot of companies who moved to the cloud are even moving back due to cost in the hyperclouds; AWS, GCP. VMWare is also making it easier for people who want to straddle traditional hosting and cloud by partnering with AWS and Google. The big thing here for committed revenue is its all moving to subscription model which is guaranteed Opex year on year.

Finally VMware for about 5 years could see that their massive market share in server hosting would be hit by cloud and thus invested in some of the best non Data Centre technologies, Velocloud which is a Network solution, Workspace 1 which is device management and Carbon Black which is the market leading security toolset. All of which lose zero market share to the cloud.

Pat identified all of this years ago. Hard to doubt he won't make a long term impact at Intel, but be willing to hold for 10 years and a nice little yearly dividends payout to help.
In the my industry (cyber), the average tenure of a Chief Information Security Officer is around 18 months. Obviously there are some differences between tech and engineering, but the old way of thinking about company loyalty is just about dead.

Hop away!

I bought GME at 21 a couple of weeks ago and then it dropped to 17. I also lost 1.8K on calls for TME that I paper handed. I've also had other losses on calls. I just started "investing" in December
Shut up stupid
All hail the bringer of sweet tendies
this is the way.. (to lose money)
https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today
Wow, I just told the old man to not invest in this stock at $20 because of the crappy business model. It also seemed like several others had the same experience with them. What‚Äôs causing the 17% spike today?
Shit...so I should've sold my 1/15 calls today?
Hypothetical situation:

Partner is about to get a federal job which means a federal pension.  You have already been working for the feds for a while and are handcuffed by the pension mostly due to the health bennys for life at MRA (57years old).  You will not be retiring before this age.  Its 17 years away.

You and your partner are now potentially going to get $90k/yr in pension+ss benefits at 62 (so there's a small gap from 57-62 but there's... other ways to cover that, also this is assuming 79% of stated SS benefit, not 100%).  You assume you need \~$75k/yr for your base retirement needs ("base" is still pretty comfy).

Do you contribute more than the minimum match to the TSP (401k) or put everything over 5% into taxable?  Or blow it?  Also your combined current retirement balances are going to be \~$1.9m in 17 years @ 5% contributions so that'll throw off another \~$75k at 57. 10% contributions = $86k, 15% contributions = $98k.  All at 57.

&#x200B;

What do?
This will continue?
Stairlink IPO would trick so many people here
Support looks good. Honestly, I think this is a fair price for it now in the 0.03s. Now we wait for more catalysts. I do think the pullback from the 0.05s was profit-taking.
what dips lmfao

I don‚Äôt know, if you will be reading this, but I think it‚Äôs very impressive that you learned from your mistakes (it takes time and every individual learns at a different pace) and that you managed to win back your losses and to make a 100$!

I am new to investing myself and I am also investing most of my savings into ETFs or blue chip stocks, but a small amount, which I ‚Äúcan afford‚Äú to lose, I am also investing in penny stocks or somewhat speculative stocks. 

If you have valuable lessons and tips regarding investing, I‚Äòd be very interested in them :) 

No one is born a master, these things take time. It‚Äòs better to learn these mistakes early and with relatively ‚Äúsmall‚Äú amounts (not saying that 1000$ is not much), but from what I saw here, people also have lost huge amounts and count yourself lucky that you do not belong to one of them.

People borrow shares and sell them, it‚Äôs called short selling. Their goal is to borrow them, sell them at a high price, then buy it back when the stock goes lower, to make a profit. Sell high, buy low. However, when a bunch of the companies shares or shorted, and the stock rapidly rises, it causes a chain reaction or short sellers buying back the stock at higher and higher prices

What happens if you only take out your initial investment and leave the profits invested (through fractional shares)? You wouldn‚Äôt have to pay taxes on that right?
That money is negative on your portfolio because either you buy the contract back for that loss, or the second you are assigned, the collateral turns into stock worth less, so that drop is priced in there.
Is this any good?

Im outside looking in at the GME short squeeze. Can someone tell me what happens once it‚Äôs over? Does it then become a race to sell your calls before everyone else does?

I mean, what happens if ends at $100? No one actually wants GME at $100...right?

Isn't it obvious?  By investing $10M in a stock yielding 0.57%, you'll get a cool $57k in dividends per year.

So.  Much.  Money.
That is in fact something that people do, using Cramer and other influencers as a pump 'n dump.
At the start of this year I wanted to see if I can 10x my account, so I started with $1k.

I got criticized heavily, but it is quite possible to do quickly. It‚Äôs a small amount so taking risk is expected and understandable. You can‚Äôt yolo your portfolio into otm calls if it‚Äôs a large $$$ of money. But with a thousand or two? No biggie.

I‚Äôve been taking profits really quickly, but failed to do so on two trades, which have been the only two losing trades so far in that acc‚Äî AAPL and MGM. Both of which were green at some point.
Yup. I just caught up. Busy all day today and saw a tweet from walter which said $2000 and then another about $1400. Amtrak joe probably pissed alot of people off by being stingy there. Maybe reallocate local aid and send $2k given how people likely thought it was an extra $2k.

The option gives him the right (but not the obligation) to buy 100 shares for $15 each. That means that if the share price is $15.01 the option contract is worth 1 dollar. At a share price of $16 the contract is worth 100 dollars. Basically, for every penny it‚Äôs over 15, he makes a dollar.If the share price is $15 or below, the contract is worth 0 because its cheaper to buy the shares on the market than to buy them for $15 dollars each. He then is out the money he paid for the contract.

All these amounts are based on the share price at the day of expiration. If it hits the $15-mark before that it is worth more because of the time left component
What is covered?
She would dick you down.

Mods, right here.
sounds like you bought the peak last week. Lots of consolidation this week.
I'll buy when she's done dipping not while she's dipping
Hedge is in the name.
A business usually starts with shares being worth loads because there are so few of them. Once shares are diluted and there are more of them the value decreases. More shares issued means the business can raise more money to fund new growth. Too many issues however makes the business look weak and attracts less business. You have to walk a fine line to get it right. 

TLSS‚Äô price is so low because they have billions of shares on sale. It means that at some point they will conduct a reverse split to reduce the number in circulation. This will hurt investors in the short term but lead to longer term gains.
He means mooning in reverse

Watch your words, youre betting against Google. We all know how much gaming has grown these last years and Google is currently leading cloud gaming. One major thing stopping people is the entry cost for gaming and cloud gaming completely solves that. Theyre not killing off Stadia for nothing, especially with Amazon also launching their own cloud gaming platform. This is a project they cant kill, this is a young field with billions to gain and basically only Google has the power to pull it off
Up 340% today
ok, but we know what are the plans for the future? at the moment it can be a great long-term play as well as a dead cat bounce
It's all play money. Just invest like a maniac.

Put it all on one penny stock or biotech stock or meme stock or 3x leveraged ETF and wait for your lottery ticket to print.
You are only retarded if you sell at a loss. It may dip to the high 20s. But it be at 50$ in 3 months

He had $1.12 mil in cash sitting there already, and likely had access to $8mil in margin, so I don‚Äôt know if would have been that ridiculous, especially with a $20 basis. Regardless, I‚Äôm glad he made good profit.

Printed money on TLRY and GME today. TLRY is an going toüöÄüåë with Canada and probably the US going back into lockdown, plus the merger with Alpha looking is looking to be as strong as ever with the Alpha earning beat.
BlackBerry and GameStop warping all the way back to the 1990s. Any other antique companies we can buy calls on??? Sears? KB Toys, Woolworths???
but stocks are a zero sum game. if we common folks are all gettin rich, doesnt that seem..too good to be true?
Explain in monies please
anyone know why DASH is dipping?
Where do you find out about stocks that are going to be on Cramer?
Explain how.
BB 3/19 $10c, it‚Äôs not a phone company and is undervalued compared to other cyber security companies, $30 by March, to the moon!!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
What's Biden doing tonight?
Tomorrow the billionaires buy hard
Holy fuck dude
im in thanks man
BB bitches üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
What the fuck did you do you retard
All Biden has to say is: "We gonna be building a lot of shit and we be pumping that green energy asap".
ELIRetarded: What does it mean for the stock price? I keep seeing people saying it could reach at least $100????
Whoever pointed out yesterday the BB 1/15 8c for .04 I you.  28x bagger is awesome.  My only regret is only buying 5 .... I doubted the vibe.
I‚Äôm not selling a danm thing, it‚Äôs long and strong
Probably better, actually.
See you in tendie heaven, brother
Kinda weird that gamestop increase thought. It is dying, everyone is switching to digital
As the autist who made this post, I‚Äôm ashamed it autocorrected to artist
That's a constant temptation to yolo everything
They can't afford it
Yeah it would definitely not be worth it to buy more calls. Premiums are so high it'd have to skyrocket again to be at all worth it.
Bought a few ICLN 1/15 35cs for shits and gigs. 
Also GME to 75 tomorrow üöÄüöÄüöÄ
60??? Wtf
If earnings doesn't do it $DIS next big buy catalyst will be positive park news.

Buy stock or long dated calls, don't YOLO, and add a little whenever a dip presents its self.
Okay thanks for the information!
Yeah I doing the same thing with 500, but realized I want to do some spreads so I'm enabling margin now
Either that or I am broke again. Riding to riches or bread lines! Help me Buyden!
***Melvin Capital has an Instagram account.***
I‚Äôve been holding $280 calls (exp 3/19) after the investigation stuff started. Portfolio has been looking very nice. Reaching new milestones every day!
In college I was lucky if I had 50 bucks to buy a couple cookout trays and some natty light. Fuck you and congrats.
As long as the fed keeps printing money, the market won‚Äôt go down. The value of your winnings will but that‚Äôs different.

Sell CCIV, hood TSLA, BB, GME
Have you tried not buying FDs?
well, not yet anyhow :)
It‚Äôs been dead the whole day dude, still on the wave and hoping Biden can do something
Individual investors who recently piled into GameStop Corp. GME 27.10% are taking a victory lap this week after shares of the struggling company surged more than 90% in the last two days, putting the stock on pace for its best weekly performance on record.

For weeks, members of Reddit‚Äôs popular WallStreetBets forum have been touting GameStop, encouraging others to scoop up shares lof the videogame retailer and begin making bullish bets. Several posts on the forum had noted that short sellers‚Äô bearish GameStop bets had been at elevated levels.

Short interest, which indicates the interest of investors betting a stock will fall in value, has hovered around 138% of the stock‚Äôs free float this year, FactSet data show. This makes it the second-most shorted company across the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc., NDAQ -0.25% according to Dow Jones Market Data. That had some Reddit users predicting that the stock might rapidly rise if short sellers suddenly had to cover their bets by buying back shares should the stock suddenly rise in value.

This week, that forecast finally appeared to take shape after news of changes to GameStop‚Äôs board sent shares climbing.

On Monday, the company said it had struck a deal to add Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen and two former executives to the GameStop board.

The announcement pushed shares up 13% on the day. On Wednesday, gains accelerated and GameStop catapulted 57% higher, its biggest share-price jump in history. GameStop gained an additional 23% in midafternoon trading Thursday.

On Reddit Thursday, WallStreetBets users were celebrating GameStop‚Äôs gains. Many posted screenshots of big wins from bullish options bets. Several talked about how they would spend their profits. One user posted that the experience demonstrates that the WallStreetBets forum ‚Äúruns the market.‚Äù

Once just a small presence in the financial markets ecosystem, retail traders are increasingly influential. Retail-trading activity has exploded within the last year as individual investors, many of whom are stuck at home, have begun to try their hands at trading.


More than 10 million new brokerage accounts were opened in 2020, JMP Securities estimates. And on peak trading days last year, individual traders are estimated to have accounted for nearly 25% of trading activity, Citadel Securities estimates. Through social media and the ability to make free stock trades, individual investors have been able to turn companies into market sensations‚ÄîGameStop being among the latest.

GameStop‚Äôs rapid share-price moves, analysts said, were spurred by news of Mr. Cohen‚Äôs addition to the board, as well as the company‚Äôs announcement Monday that online sales sharply increased during the holidays. Mr. Cohen‚Äôs investment firm has been building up a stake in GameStop and has urged the company to improve its online business. Mr. Cohen is known for the e-commerce savvy he displayed at Chewy, the pet-products online retailer.

That set the stage for the short squeeze, analysts and individual investors claimed.

‚ÄúThe shorts are freaking out,‚Äù said Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities. Meanwhile, ‚ÄúRobinhood message boards are bragging.‚Äù

One individual investor who was celebrating GameStop‚Äôs win Thursday was Jackson Call, a 24-year-old trader. He had been seeing WallStreetBets users encouraging others to buy shares of the company in recent weeks.

‚ÄúI was thinking ‚ÄòGameStop? What in the world?‚Äô‚Äù said Mr. Call, a student in North Carolina. ‚ÄúI kept saying ‚ÄòNo way am I going to buy into this thing.‚Äô‚Äù

But this week he saw CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer talking about GameStop. He decided to purchase roughly 80 shares of the company for slightly more than $20 apiece at the opening bell Wednesday, he said. That was right before the stock catapulted higher.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôll just keep marching higher because there‚Äôs such a high short interest,‚Äù Mr. Call said. He picked up more shares of GameStop Thursday when the stock briefly pared its early morning highs.
If making 500% on your call at open tomorrow is fucking up, then you are so fucked my dude
Guys DFV has a couple milly in reserve. could he, in theory, dump it in all at once and force a violent short squeeze?
GANG SHIT üöÄüöÄüöÄ
not in all EU countries unfortunately :(
He's injecting $1.9 trillion into GME I hear
Mostly speculation that Melvin is selling shorts. But reality is we just made them the bad guy for all short sellers. We don‚Äôt know who borrowed all the shares but we do know they are hurting.
Jfc my guy you are a legend. WHATS NEXT?! I‚Äôll follow you till the ends of the earth.
People are going to be talking about getting BB under $12 for the next 6 months
Anyone else gambling their life savings in hopes of being able to buy a house?
I'm with you I'll hold till the end of the week and set a stop of .90, I mean it didn't sky rocket,  but I think if it's holding ok for today after a bunch of people sell off, then there could be a small opportunity.
!Remind me 73 days "ARKX"
Yup exactly
How does it feel making $2 million a day?
Bro you got fucking BENT
I wouldn't say flopped. The technology is definitely being used by tech saavy individuals and hobbyists.

The reason you don't see 3d printers in every home is because the average person is either too lazy or too stupid to learn the technology. More being lazy than stupid, I hope.

Point being, 3D printing has a small learning curve involving printer maintenance (electrical and mechanical), operation and modeling(software), and maybe chemical from different plastics requiring different parameters from the machine or even enclosures to regulate environmental temperature.

tl;dr.. the technology available is far too complex and finicky for the average person to want in their homes. More of a hobbyist thing.

How bad does Cloudflare earnings have to be for it to go to 70 or even 60s? I currently have an odd amount of shares and need more to be able to sell more calls

Me too. I remember it like yesterday.
I‚Äôve just started this. 

I used to do a lot of push ups when I was younger. 

Havent in 10 yr + 

In fact 10 was hard 2 weeks ago. 

I‚Äôm doing 20 at a time 2 sets each 


Over the last week I‚Äôve done about 500 push-ups or so

Today 100 to cover $1 loss

30 so far on the 100 to cover my $2 loss 

Cant place another trade till I do the 70 more 

Honestly respecting this today I‚Äôm not taking positions 

Which is amazing cause I seem to have no fomo. I‚Äôm appalled this isn‚Äôt my normal!
Bb. Who‚Äôs with me?
BB IS NOT JUST A PHONE COMPANY. PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH THEY ARE LITERALLY EVERYWHERE IN CARS TOO. THEY ARE THE NEXT UP.
Thoughts on BB? I don‚Äôt get the hype.

For GME, I bought $100k of shares that are up 126% and $95k in calls now worth $320k.  Overall, my individual trading account is now $9.4M still holding majority TSLA.  Including my 401k (which is mostly TSLA shares), I'm at $14.3M.  Bought $250k worth of TSLA 2/12 $895C.
You sir, are retarded
You think the stocks gonna fucking triple in a week
Bro watch his YouTube videos.  He‚Äôs Roaring Kitty on YouTube.  It‚Äôs worth it.

He explained in his Christmas update video post that this is absolutely life changing money for him.  He was not a millionaire before.  

Really humble dude and extremely cool.  I‚Äôve watched a couple hours of his past few live streams, he‚Äôs the fucking man.  Just drinking beer, saying whatup to the other GME bulls, and discussing GameStop for literally 5 hours straight. It‚Äôs amazing!
I'll show if you show yours first
I‚Äôm so sorry you got fucked today

üíéüôèüèª‚ú®
Which index is that?
Buyden's speech: Trillions of dollars spent on stimulus, which raises liquidity and cashflow in the markets, will weaken the dollar, will theoretically bring more overseas profit to the US for companies selling stuff, like AAPL, TSLA, etc. People will probably invest more in GLD, SLV, and B\*tcoin. Infrastructure will benefit.   
Looks like for now, we'll have to wait for the EV, ICLN boost--> should come up whenever the Energy secretary can be announced.   
TL;DR - stonks will go up lots in the next several months (if not tomorrow) even though stimulus news is "priced in".
It has less to do with greed, and more to do with dopamine and the fact that our brain likes numbers. I also don‚Äôt think greed makes sense in the market, because it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre taking from others when you buy shares or calls and the price goes up, your investment is growing. When it goes down and you lose money, you didn‚Äôt lose money because you were greedy, you were just trying to achieve the maximum.
I predict $10k student loan forgiveness, and every 4 years they will dangle another $10k like carrot in front of a mule during a rainy season

Tyvm for your contribution.
It‚Äôs up like 100% since Wednesday so I‚Äôm not sure. I was calling people retarded for buying in today, but those who got in on the dip made some nice tendies. There‚Äôs always a play, but many are saying the squeeze hasn‚Äôt happened yet.. looking at the 1 year chart of GME I‚Äôd beg to differ, but who the fuck knows lol
Just realized how true this statement was!
for once im glad I didn't inverse OP. good call my guy
I got in today on the dip, that means its gonna keep going down.
How did you miss the GME train this sub was (and is) GME for the last month
Yeah even under 12 is a steal

What happened bby?
I‚Äôm super lucky to have an amazing dad who knows the stock market and told me to invest early. Had 50K set aside from him for college in my savings. I think I watched a YouTube video or two on Tesla and bought an even 750.
Jesus, 4 straight days ripping aint enough for you? How far OTM did you buy? Lol
The 75% is just on on position which could be a return of 5-10% on a position with the sizing $10-15k. So 75% gain would be about $750-1,000 nominal gain per play.
Hello yeah bro. They going to order one for me
Thank you
Seems like maybe the FB sell off is getting overdone? If I would have to guess I would say earnings will be strong since everyone is inside on their phones plus political ad spending in the last quarter. Any thoughts of feb calls to play on a potential earnings run up?
Just taking part is already super valuable beyond the shares. Just one example.

You read a linked news article, the news site tracks traffic, engagement etc for every article. If they notice a spike in any metric they will dig deeper and keep an eye out and if the trend continues word spreads and few months later you have a social buzz
To be serious for a sec, there really is something nice about the retail investor being able to win in a market set up for our failure so it warms my heart seeing the gain porn. 

On the other hand, buy shares GME is going higher.
Why do higher bond yields make tech go down ?
It's been free tendies for 3 weeks now.
Congrats!
Huawei partnership they bought 80 of BB patents. You will see BB tech in one of the biggest mobile companies on the eastern side of this world. More than half the worlds population occupies that sector.
He‚Äôs a lucky boyeeee
What‚Äôs the move with GME?
Look at his post history. This dudes been jerking off to gme for well over a year
Bro every time someone posts a stupid high PT I whip out the calculator and dream of retirement
I'm gonna disagree with you a little bit. On paper you're right, 30k is a small amount compared to a $1m portfolio. But, the paths getting those two things are very different. It's pretty easy to invest \~15% in a 401k over 25 years and end up with $1m in the stock market and still struggle to come up with a 30k EF, especially since nobody recommends taking 25 years to come up with an EF of that size. 

IOW, letting that 15% contribution coast along in a 401k for 25 years while your EF gets depleted due to "Life Events" and having to rebuild it several times over those same 25 years is pretty common I'd imagine.

Why did you wait until it ran up 100% already. You have two days to get on the train already. We might not let you on now.

Go on
He also probably bought the house for $30K, new.

I got on the hype train and bought 800 shares of GME at average $41.50. I have basic idea of what GME does buy doesn't have any knowledge about their business plans and such. 

All other stocks I have are the company I believe in.

Should I hold on to GME for now or dump it tomorrow?
I'm just jealous of GME gang and all the instant millionaires. I've got LEAPS and July calls so it's just a waiting game.
Shares. The call  iv is fucking wild right now. Or I guess you could do weeklies for next week haha
IV is insane. If that drops anytime soon without major move in underlying you‚Äôre going to get fucked by Vega.
Ratio went from 19 to 31? I'm retarded but doesn't that mean short interest has been going up?
No need to shout
you‚Äôre gonna swim in tendies before your contract expires.
Its impossible to be too bearish on nkla.

They weren't able to give me a new title but they increased the money from 7.9% to 12%. An extra $5,000 in my pocket.

Obviously not my "ask" but they met me in the middle. I'll take it.

You could open an account with a US broker, e.g. Tastyworks or Firstrade.
They don‚Äôt have the stock to begin with, so they need to borrow it. If very little stock is available, the fee gets higher and higher that they have to pay interest on.

They do it to raise money and either pay off their debt or give them more resources to acquire extra business. 

Short term it leads to price drops but long term you get a better return because the business does better. Every company does this. If you believe in the company you just take it as a natural thing and maybe even buy the dips.
Can I fuk BB?

I've look at the stock markets charts, the futures, the pre-markets, the after-markets, several times a day, for the last what feels like a year, and the price never changes. Why come?
So I sold calls yesterday for $240 that ended up worth $4800 by EOD I‚Äôm shattered
I just bought three rotisserie chickens for lunch
All the boomers who own ICLN must be freaking out when they look at the price action of the last couple of weeks.

Man those things scare me.. and what do you mean pilot? Those things fly wherever wind carries them :(
Its almost as if these institutions are mad that after they went under (with the peoples money) they cant gamble anymore. They just jealous haters.

Keep manipulating silver JP WE SEE YOU!
what about buying PLTR at the top

It might be, but a comparison between ICLN and PLUG doesn't show a convincing correlation.

Repouss√© (French: [ Å…ôpuse] (listen)) or repoussage ([ Å…ôpusa í] (listen)) refer to a metalworking technique in which a malleable metal is shaped by hammering from the reverse side to create a design in low relief. Chasing, chased work, or embossing refer to a similar technique, in which the piece is hammered on the front side, sinking the metal.

Stop trying to play the market fam. If you want to be an above average investor you can do research on your investments. 

The WSB people only post the ultra highs and the ultra lows, not the oceans of mediocre performance that 99.9% of them get. It's called bets for a reason.

RH is the best for buying those 2 cent FDs since there‚Äôs no commission
Yeah, I have a feeling that the GME squeeE is done. I don't know that SPY will be 385, in fact I think it'll open down tomorrow, but yeah. I could be wrong, though, as I very often am.
From what I can see I am pretty limited with a cheomebook. I am in the dark about things like brokers and platforms and how to use them in relation to MT4/MT5.

Could you help explain how/what I should be using?
Buyback plan until February. I‚Äôd say yeah.
I literally opened my trading account like 3 days ago and all this is new to me. I was told options are complicated so it kinda scared me away. I bought a 2/5 $11 call @$1.06 just to see what happens tomorrow. Hope this works out.

Too bad they'll cash it in at the $50 peak tomorrow mid morning.
Omfg those BB calls.might print
The "days to cover" concept is a calculation based on average daily volume which is 12M shares.  In the past 2 days the volume is about 250M.  If they shorted 69M shares they could have easily unwound everything.  Since nobody knows for sure I'd highly recommend that you invest for value only and not anticipate more squeezes.  It's possible it squeezes again, it's also possible that was it.
You heard the man, roll those calls to February! Feb IV is cheap by comparison, so it's already in sale!
Honestly Walrus sorted me right out with ZOM BNGO and CLWD. Some of the best DD I've seen. Got some at 1.05, more at 1.12. Its gonna fly tomorrow, might wait til pullback and get more!

Yeah, this is a super helpful addition to the sub to hopefully try to limit the bag holders. Good looking out by the admins!
Just learning, wanted to lock in profits and weed stocks are very volatile, thought it could be a temporary bump rather than what it now appears to be, a stepping stone on the way to the moon. Obviously I am regretful now and feel like I've learned a valuable lesson, but hindsight is always 20/20 and profit is profit.

Praise be to GME.  May you land on the moon tomorrow.
Selling at $50 tomorrow
Sold today. Might get back in once the gme hype dies down

You‚Äôre taking me on a fancy dinner date with your gains at that point

I hope so. Thinking about buying some more before it goes up too much. Just got my co worker to buy a 1000 shares too
Will buy GME at next dip
In at $20, still holding. 

Most likely will let it go tomorrow, we'll see.
So Tesla isn‚Äôt a safe haven for cash interesting
Oil companies are loaded to the teeth with debt which they acquired during the glory days - when all people could envision was ever-increasing demand and ever-dwindling supply, leading to rocketing prices. Now it seems that will never happen. We have more supply that we thought, and we may have seen peak demand. Their long term plans haven't worked
What‚Äôs the deal with RIOT?
yeah same. THey need an option to turn that shit off or change it to investment returns cause it's really not cool for a trader/investor. No one wants to see that shit.
Interesting. So it could be a long short squeeze
Right? Make them beg for it back. Block their number. Turn off the lights.

Hi, thanks for the info!

I'll look into PYPL and SQ, don't know much about fintech but I'll do some research into that as I'm sure it has a lot of potential. Which fin-tech co would you think is the most "open minded" to blockchain/cryptocurrency? Although I don't want to invest directly in blockchain or cryptocurrencies I wouldn't mind some small exposure to it.

I'd rather avoid a specific genomics exposure, as I have it through REGN and CTVA and of course the index funds. As a value investor I'm not too interested in the very high valuations of a lot of genomics companies in ARKG (and the volatility), I think a lot of genomics work will end up be being done by the larger biotech companies such as REGN and others such as Gilead etc. which have more favorable valuations in my opinion. 

Thank you!
This was the same thought I had earlier today...
Thanks for the re assurance step bro.
Ye i know, but him selling it today translates to him not wanting to risk it tomorrow, meaning tomorrow might rip my asshole apart
Same so either way we're fucking together
GME GANG ü§ù BB GANG

Implied volatiliy. Stock is volatile so options get more pricey. 

If you're selling options, you're going to want a lot more if the stock is likely to move, so they're a lot more expensive to buy.

In case that wasn't sarcastic.

That's the worst thing on the internet? 

Do you, or any of the other bitcoin shills, actually have some hard data to share? Like a  graph of bitcoin holdings by institutional investors as a percentage of total bitcoins in circulation?  I'm very eager to see how this percentage is changing. People saying 'oh this time around, it's different. Institutions are piling in' need to be able to actually show this data instead of pointing to Grayscale as the beginning and end of their arguments.

Yup. I teach sailing already and plan to eventually get my captain‚Äôs license and continue teaching what I‚Äôm certified to teach, maybe in different locations (Hawaii, Caribbean, etc.).

This is the beauty of having great gains with gme the past few months. It drops ten percent tomo which I don‚Äôt think it will. Retards will buy the dip - losing 10-15 percent on a stock if you have conviction in and having a great time doing it who cares.

Do you really need to ask when WSB is buying GME at 300% IV?
Uhm. So, that would be yesterdays numbers I presume since it says a price of $31. Also what does average daily trades, calculated over i don't know how many days, matter when yesterday and today had over 200M. It's over.
Just based on fundamentals GME is undervalued. Trading at about a P/S of 0.5, if we assume GME can be priced as a growth stock like SQ, which has a PS of 15, then GME shares could be worth almost $1200 on growth potential alone, forget a MOASS.


TL;DR: GME cheap, buy shares. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Senseonics Holdings shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Senseonics Holdings is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Medical Info Systems industry that ranks in the Bottom¬† 6% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter

I‚Äôm okay with $PLTR being a little lazy lately and looking like a clearance rack at Target. I‚Äôm scooping more of it up right now before it‚Äôs too late.
thats how you're supposed to look at it. that's how it works. people need to know this. you are not buying a company so you can sell it to another idiot at a higher price. you are purchasing because now or sometime in the future the company will be producing so much cash flow and giving that back as dividends and the dividend yield will be so high if people don't bid up the price. who cares if the another idiot doesnt want to buy your company for a higher price. just sit the dividends and collect 50% yield. crazy. this is how it works. this is what people need to know. thats why companies that never pay dividends are ponzi schemes. no buyback, no anything, they NEED to pay dividends. at some point in their life. otherwise ponzi scheme.

I'm not asking how to *predict* a flat market or *predict* when that market is going to wake back up. I'm asking the best way to tell in real-time when it's gone flat. It's been [like this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/735561381851431028/799354487419830302/unknown.png) for 4 days. It would seem like there should be a method to determine a shallow-range algorithmically.

You will hate yourself after you sell
Spy $400c 2/19 will print
I‚Äôm no Expert, but I believe it‚Äôs based on 3 things;

1. Time Value: the Further out the expiration date, the more expensive the ask price. Similar to purchasing insurance, it costs more the longer you have it.

2. Underlying Stock Price: This one‚Äôs simple! If the stock costs more, ask price is higher.

3. Volatility: The more the stock price fluctuates, the riskier it is to invest in, a more volatile stock comes with more risk, hence a higher premium is expected.

Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but this is how I understood it when it was explained to me.

ICLN is still down around 30% since its inception in 2008. I wonder whether some people that bought into then have held it all this time.

My portfolio is up $94k (58.5%) in the last two days. Mostly from GME, but almost all my positions are doing really well. Feeling especially happy that I broke a quarter million today.
Why would that be announced today? Holding 50 shares @ 16 so ofc I‚Äôd be hyped just haven‚Äôt heard that rumor
what do we have for nio?
well, like I've said. They were under investigation for unethical competition by the US Anti trust committee so that's not capitalism that illegal. There are rules in place for doing business and for lawful competition and those are in place to protect consumers. 

So while you're right about a business being at it's basics about getting the customer to use their services, how they go about doing this is mandated by rules. And that's what I'm pointing out.

here is an article that talks about it : https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/amazon-bullies-partners-and-vendors-says-antitrust-subcommittee.html

And if they push so hard as to have the us gouvernement get involved in their business model you can bet your ass it's going to impact the stock price. That why I say I prefer ethical companies with morally sound CEO's that aren't constantly being investigated.

It‚Äôs just a matter of priorities. I have fire goals but I wasn‚Äôt willing to delay starting a family to achieve them. I had my first kid young which definitely increased expenses. If I had waited an extra 5 years I could have built up a huge nest egg and coastFIRED. Some people on this sub prefer that route. 

If you can afford a family and want it now then don‚Äôt let early retirement stop you.

> Okay tell me what you would invest in then.

I don't give specific investment advice, unless someone is willing to pay me at least a million dollars/year to do so, which would probably make them much more, depending on AUM; I am *very* good at it. 

Invest in what you understand. If you understand nothing, invest in world indexes. Without superior knowledge of the world you can't consistently beat the market.

> Why is there so much sentiment on ICLN then?

Because most people are stupid. Monkey see, monkey do. Momentum trading works, until it doesn't. People are terrified to do something nobody else is doing. I take positions *before* the masses want it.

> So much is already priced in, but renewable energy is guaranteed in the far future so I believe this is practically a guaranteed long term play

The "renewable energy" provided by companies today and the "renewable energy" the future needs are not be the same. If you look deep enough, you will often find that there is nothing sustainable about those technologies or companies. People invest in the story, but if you look for the details, it all falls apart.
More important that silly hypotheticals on what someone may own: You only lost 1/3 of your asset if you sold it.  If you held it.... well, you probably know the answer.

&#x200B;

But for OP's query, rating risk is a comparative metric. VOO risk is high compared to less risky asset classes, say investment-grade corporate bonds. That five point risk scale covers the whole spectrum of investment risk.

The coldest, hardest üíéüñê we've seen in a long time. Absolute legend.
Thats just how it goes with the options game. The OXY calls i sold in late November for 2 grand closed worth 50k today. Oh well, on to the next play. At least I didn‚Äôt take a loss.
Ok, an almost 100% failure rate on their shorts.  Their gain is because of their long positions like Jumia.  It has been pretty uncanny how shitty they‚Äôve done on their shorts, while obvious shorts like NKLA passed them by.
So then that slight dip may be a signal to throw a good couple hundred at? 

I also purchased 50 shares of OGI and thats slightly up. My brokerage hasn't cleared my deposit (its been 4 friggen days..) else I'd have 30 of Cresco as well. Interested to see where fuel, accomodations, and cannabis will go post-COVID.. though I'm reading and learning about everything.

Thanks, bud!
I have 2022 calls so it‚Äôs my chill stock I‚Äôll let it do it‚Äôs thing when it wants to. Would recommend
If you are thinking this is the squeeze then the jan 29 calls are far enough put to let this thing ride. 

If you believe no squeeze and want to buy much safer calls, look at April 16th and this will give you time after earnings (which is expected to be better than recent years)

Maxing out the TSP (forget about roth for a second) gives us \~$200k/yr in retirement, on an assumed $75k/yr spend.  Is that really necessary? To lock that money up like you're locked into the pension?  I could see maybe Roth first then maxing TSP after.... maybe.  But even then I'm leaning towards Roth first and then taxable after.

Agreed. I figured this means plenty of cash to exercise on the April ones if needed.
I bet he is gonna hold these Apr 16 calls until Apr 15
You will be fine with shares
It's people taking AH gains or MMs pushing it downwards. It isn't dropping fast enough to be significant if you look at the volume, likely MMs trying to take the edge off for tomorrow, or try to suppress momentum.
BB AH so good
There‚Äôs exceptions but that doesn‚Äôt change the rule!
üôèüôèüôè
You guys best be real careful holding options overnight, they are likely to be exercised even if otm, methinks there will be some insane loss pron from this going from lambos to Tonka trucks.
This is the way

I've made enough money. Going to cash out tomorrow
8923 weeks to go
Not exactly but yes.  My understanding is (I'm an amateur)

An index fund follows a set guideline of stocks that meet that index rules.  There are s&p500 index mutual funds and ETFs, clean energy mutual funds and ETFs, etc.  These only buy certain stocks in certain percentages of weight (only own 20% of 1 stock because that stock makes up 20% of that index.)

However, ETFs don't have to follow an index.  In fact sometimes two different ETFs in the same sector, one can be an index following and one is a trend following. 

Like BUG and CIBR.  Both are cyber security ETFs.  BUG follows Indxx cybersecurity index, CIBR just invests in what it considers is cyber security related on it's own judgement.
since 2017 iirc, could be wrong on that
Long LEAPs is the only play.
I know someone who bought WDI for over 100$/share and lost 300k $ when it went down to 0.5$/share. Last week it went from 0.5$ to 1$/share. Imagine him saying: instead of losing 99.9% i look at as if i made 100% profit from 0.5 to 1% while s&p500 made only 8%.

My dude. Just invest into a very broad ETF and you will be a millionair when you retire.
God.
I shorted apha today eod üò¨
I read your dd & I am a little confused. If you don't mind, could you explain   


a) what will happen if people were to sell their shares at open tomorrow  
b) if everyone sold their contracts instead of exercising it  
c) If they did not exercise it & held it to expiration  


Which of these scenarios would drive the down & why
BB is just taking off
I suggested a friend to go in on a few shares a couple of days ago and now she is saying she won't take my advice anymore lol
Maybe its investor sentiment. I don‚Äôt know. Some may see it as investing in the demise of civilization....Extreme? maybe yeah. I sold all my etf (SPY, VTI) because I don‚Äôt want to indirectly invest in companies I morally/ethically object to. Remember that scene from big short where the young dudes made a fortune with options on controversial companies like Phillip Morris or smith n Wesson. Same thing today with vaccines I‚Äôm sure.
You missed the train man, it's probably too late. There still might be some upside, but with IV as high as it is, you're going to have a hard time making money buying options to open.

Tesla is valued at 1500 P/E.

Gamestop is currently under 0.50 P/E and they're on an extremely obvious pivot path to e-commerce.

Not saying every company will be Tesla by any means, but 0.50 is a stupidly low valuation with how high the multiples are getting nowadays. Once it's more clear to your average investor is when it will be valued correctly.

TSLA doing a Cup and Handle now, it is getting ready to break out
Yeah I figured the sector itself is up 10% on the rumor and hard to buy the rumor and hold for the news when you're looking at triple digit gains. I thought about sizing down (buying my short 45cs) but the combined more likely scenario is either a rip above or a retrace below. Both of those hurt on my setup (41/45/46) and I'm not confident that we'll actually rip above to where buying 1DTE 45cs *now* makes sense. 

Hope it works out for ya!
He‚Äôs doing that tomorrow.
I sold those contracts, the 3.69 and .36 is the decrease in value from the price I sold it at. I think delta and theta influenced this drastic drop in price in literally a couple hours.

Stop the sell!
So, options trading isn't buying shares, it's buying contracts stipulating the stock will go up or down.  Literal gambling unless you know something others do not.

Currently, large funds have *huge* positions betting the stock will go down.  They are short the stock (puts).

The Reddit hive mind sees the volume of shorts is so large that if they force the stock up, the big funds will be forced to buy shares at a higher market price and sell at a loss to those that have call options.

When the short sellers are forced out of their contracts due to time (the expiry on the contract) their options will expire in the negative and everyone with call options get a share of that value the shorts are losing.  At the same time, the massive demand for shares as a result of shorts buying stocks forces the value of the stock up.  This is the "short squeeze".

We are waiting for those who bet the stock will go down to lose their money so the stock goes up due to high purchasing demand.  Currently I think most of the uptick is due to a significant amount of investment from investors that are long term on the stock.  Those who bought the stock early when market sentiment was negative experienced a 100%+ gain.  This has only put MORE pressure on the short sellers and they are bleeding cash like crazy, increasing the probability of a "short squeeze".

That's how I understand it.  I may have some aspects wrong.  But that's the general idea.
I agree on all your points. Can't believe I forgot to mention the Saudis/OPEC.

Congrats on the gains - it has been a great year for a lot of people, but only for the people who could see market crisis as market opportunity. 

Break even is *slightly* higher when you include transaction fees, but this seems like a worthwhile play if you are bullish on the stock. I really like the article about IV on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp), almost everything I learned I learned there or in conversations like this one. 

ET is an interesting play and I don't know a damn thing about them except that they're in natural gas. A lot of people aren't loving the oil and gas stocks, especially under a Biden administration and a democratic congress; I'm used to the clean energy meme stock echo chamber at WSB - curious if you could tell me a little about why you're bullish on ET?

That's also why people get IV crushed btw. Which pretty much always happens after earnings because the catalyst is gone, so unless the stock immediately moons, the options lose most of their value because the IV drops massively.

Welp day. Thought as the market was starting to slow down in any real kind of movement in the morning, that it'd be your sturdiest day of the week but then big tech (although it was mostly Google/Amazon that tried) plus Tesla all reversed after trying to go up in the morning. 

Probably the weakest week in a while this week, although still nothing compared to what we have seen before. Although small caps are still having fun!

I haven't looked into it but will the Roth TSP lock your money up like traditional TSP? Or can you access that earlier if need be (contributions, not gains)?
Product vs Program manager is a company by company distinction and largely fall under the catchall "PM" term. At Microsoft I believe the PMs were Program manager and it is a broad term, Google breaks them up into 2-3 different roles, I don't know Amazon's structure but it is different as well if I recall correctly.

If your GF is a Project Manager switching to Program or Product Manager will likely open more opportunities and chances for pay increases down the road and make it easier to swap companies. I would _typically_ expect a project manager to mainly manage timelines and some resources where a program/product manager is doing a mix of technical decisions and planning, customer/user advocacy, etc: basically the interface between engineering and "the real world".

As for that pay outside of big tech: you are going to have a hard time matching big tech/unicorn stable compensation for mid-career level anywhere else. If you hit a degree of specialized senior/staff/principal then you may be able to command a high salary in your specialty at smaller shops or advanced stage startups.
I've gone through the same phase and have had really good luck the past year and a half or so buying winners but most importantly letting them run. Limit your downside with stops and let your winners go it'll pay off.

The gme thing has me laughing.  I hope most people took their gains today, it just makes zero sense that the squeeze will continue this long with the insane volume traded today.

Still have a long bias overall, but Asia looked so overbought, I couldn't help myself. Still in that trade and basically free-rolling now, risk has been taken off the table.

Would like to see ES below the monthly VWAP and closer to the 2021 start price again. We aren't even that far, so it's not as if I'm a greedy mini-bear.

Long story short, wanted to go long, just not at this price...so shorting today seemed like the sensible option ;)

Very interesting post.  Thanks.

On your 3rd point, I am wondering if in addition to the delta implications of people moving further OTM from ITM calls expiring tomorrow, wouldn't there also be a dynamic of being able to afford fewer contracts even at the same strike price since the time premium will be higher?  So even if 100% of people rebought immediately at the same strike price expiring next week, the number of shares MM would need to hold will fall because the number of contracts will be fewer.  Not sure if this thinking is correct.
OP probably asked people to do his homework for him in school.
$80 to $160, although I suspect we will only get to about $50 tomorrow

Man fuck that, should still be going up. That‚Äôs nothing for energy
I bought 1000 shares at $4 and sold at $3.80. My worst paper hands moment.
Its crazy how much wsb has changed. Back when I joined in 2017 there was insane amount of DD but if you hopped into a position after wsb hyped it up you were going to lose money 9 times out of 10. Now fast forward now the DD is trash but if you hop in a meme stock when wsb is talking about it 9 times out of 10 you are making money.
Remind me! 70 days ARKX
They were fuk anyway
Put/Call ratio is at the lowest levels (e.g. euphoric high) since the late 1990s dot-com era.

BB price prediction Jan 2022?
For sure lol. I have some money I wouldn't miss so I'm following DFV's meme train. 

I closed today 25% up on what ended up being GME 4/16 24c so hopefully the DD and BS all over this sub is right. If not, not sleep lost. If so, I'm printing tendies :D
Ok tards listen up...... with so much call gamma rolling off GME tomorrow the MMs will be selling shares like crazy all day.  It is probably going to pin and trade sideways...... but it is just a breather.  The shorts are nowhere near covered here.  On Monday the squeeze will really start to move.  Tomorrow on dips is a good day to load up.
If you hate money, sure.
didn‚Äôt realize reddit is a blog.
Let's start the AMC short squeeze.

I hope it pops for you bro. Legit don‚Äôt give a shit about the shares just wanted the premium
Hey can someone link me to the dude who looks like a penis that said he checked WSB and determined his next short was GME?
$XL all the way. Great price, primed for reversal. Stim announcement going to boost EV big time and $XL with most potential to squeeze up a bunch!
But does s/he deserve salvation? I think not in this case! Lol
I could say something about the diversification of an ETF but this is r/wsb so no one wants actual stability.

EQNR is worth watching I guess. I saw the news I don't know much about their fundamentals. But then again, you could just YOLO like an autist.
Glad to hear that!
That was all my parents would let me borrow. üòÇ
why BB?
Lol, we've been around here for a while hearing GME stuff.

Optimistic stuff on the F word was like $25.

We can give board member Cohen a double bump to $50.

An index fund follows an index. Not all ETFs follow an index, there are funds that follow different sectors like ARK and it's various funds. There are also funds that follow different asset classes i.e commodities, precious minerals, bonds, reality.
Ideally sure. But that's trying to time the market, and being risky instead of locking in profits.
Yes

Fair value would be around between 70 and 90. But if a short squeeze happens, and it's becoming increasingly likely there will be, it can shoot up to infinity basically, and that's not a joke. 

Tesla is at the end of a year long short squeeze now and google Volkswagen short squeeze to get an idea just how high (albeit for a very short time) this can go. 

For gme the rough estimate is that it would go to at least 150, but if the squeeze is extremely brutal, it could go to 400 or higher (the aim of this sub is 420.69). 

But even with the current price the company is still heavily undervalued. Market cap is now 2.78B. in previous console cycles it always hit at least 4B. So even without Cohen and potential short squeeze this stock would go up this year. Cohen makes this a solid value stock while the short squeeze is pure rocket fuel.
Can you get me one too? I could use a few extra identities.

and then beyond
Was holding ICLN Feb for a while but the theta decay is real on that position. Still sold it at a big profit, but it was plummeting this past week even though the stock was going up. Glad I got out when I did.

Not shitting on ICLN, still big bullish on it and will probably re-up, but I‚Äôd go at least March or April. Not only because of what I mentioned earlier, but because it will take at least that long to write and then move any meaningful energy legislation through congress‚Äîeven with a Dem majority.
Glad I was in aroind 0.42 price point. FDA pushing reviews back due to Covid did delay this company. Nice CGM device that would actually be a benefit to diabetes and last longer than dexcom device.
Sounds like a plan. I have the same ones as you for Feb but I'm negative... also holding amd and you know how this week went

Trying to run LEAPS out of my Roth IRA but fucking Vanguard not clearing my shit for days.
Nice, can I have some of your money please?
I have 3 monthly payers that I roll between.  Each one ends on a different week.

This week HNDL pays out (ex date was today). I‚Äôll wait for the share price to recover and roll to the next one.  If it recovers by next week, then I sell and buy KBWD which has an ex date of the 19th.  I‚Äôll do the same and purchase YYY the following week.  If all goes well, I collect about 2% on my money in a month.  If the share price doesn‚Äôt recover enough, I just keep holding.  Been doing this successfully for a few months now and hope to yield about 25% on the year with my idle cash -  it mind blowing when looking in relations to the rest of my portfolio but way better than the .01% I was getting by just letting it sit as cash in my account.

The worst case scenario is a catastrophic share price collapse like in March.  In that case, just hold witch ever etf you happen to have and wait for recovery while collecting dividend.  Bonus is dollar cost averaging, your dividend payouts will buy even more shares and it‚Äôll be a extra little bit when the share price recovers.
Awesome!
This is how I feel about NOK.
I remember when everyone was bearish on fb since they thought their advertisements would take a hit and he cucked all the gay bears at earnings. He will do it again
Lol People were saying "Blockbuster", still makes me chuckle
No problem! I started work remotely so I haven't met him in person but on my first day at work we had a virtual Q&A with him which was pretty cool haha
Xpev, you missed the finance deal from the banks. Have them, but got a feeling they are gonna have more turbulence. Hoping for continuous good ER, deliveries and news on their sedan following the ET7.
I'm just stating the reason as to why it was flagged as suspicious
I remember when it was 20/share and I was like, man IV is insane, no way I‚Äôm buying calls?
Is AAPL the 2nd most shorted stock after TSLA or what, why the fuck is it always red when there's positive news. EV announcement? Every other EV but AAPL goes up. Good phone sales? Welp time to go down. It's like AAPL holders are 90% "sell the news" retarded boomers.
If you are committed to the cause then you will EXERCISE at least half of those. Then you can double dip on your gains by riding it out until the squeeze and writing OTM weekly covered calls that the rest of us tards will scoop up üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

PS- congrats and F U
Up big on BB and seriously mad at myself for not buying more. Damn.
Threw $5k on 8c 1/15 this morning
Tomorrow will decide whether I lose all my gains for the week or not
What time tonight is the speech do you know?
Also there‚Äôs a rumor Ark is doing a Aerospace ETF so that should pump a little if true.
A more realistic comparison would be chewy or Amazon which both trade around 4x P/S. That would put us right around $300/share. That could easily happen for sure. It could also not happen but still the Coehn story yields a lot of growth. Weighing both potential options I see $90 as pretty fair

Man what a day. BB is gonna print so hard tomorrow.

is it even possible to set one?
very well done.
Don‚Äôt forget, market is closed on Monday. MLK day

Oh fucj I bought 3 PLTR calls for 600
I still don‚Äôt get this idea of wanting to live of dividends.
It‚Äôs a purely emotional endeavor and there is no advantage over stocks with low or zero dividends.

Chasing stocks with high yield will likely result in underperformance because of value traps. Total return is the only metric that matters ignoring risks.

I hear it's 10 bucks he borrowed from his destitute mother
I saw this and bought real quick 500 @ $1.05, but then saw you got flagged...I forgot about new rules if you include a YouTube link...and was worried and glad I only got 500...when it hit $1.46...not so worried...thx

Yeah man. Big divergent low. Holding it too.
Lol no way. That's a bearish sign thought because I'm assuming at some point (march cough) people will try and take long cap gains treatments and something big might happen?
You have to let them expire and lose all of your money. Unless they gain value tomorrow and are able to be sold.

I've been there and done that. All it takes is to buy when you see something going up, and sell at the first sign of red, the first pullback that makes you think "shit shit shit its going to $0". 

I personally have lost money on the most bullish stock of last year because I couldn't handle a small pullback.
ah good one. ill add that in later.

Just bought 15 shares of BB and a 12c 3/19. Still holding GME too. üíéüôå all day

After hours price is at 1.35
As someone that just made a killing (for me) on GME and has been taking profits along the way I appreciate some good DD about the other side of the trade.  


One thing I'm curious about though: Tomorrow's selling event you predict here is a one-day event. And since options don't trade pre-market it would necessarily take place during trading hours. Why would I hedge for a one-day, market hours only, event by buying a put expiring next week which will have a much higher IV and be more expensive due to theta when I can just buy much cheaper 0-day puts to cover my ass tomorrow?
That‚Äôs the plan it was shit EOD
üêê
PLTR is longer term and is not a short squeeze risk.  GME has specific dates for said squeeze
I thought poor people don‚Äôt invest in the market?
Do it homie
What a day
PLTR wasn‚Äôt a short squeeze
Market is stupid.

yeah it has been that way for a hot minute though. There is no indication that things will collapse especially not with current fiscal/monetary policies in place. The housing market is in the exact same situation. It really sucks for young people but it is almost certainly a better move to get into both real estate and stocks now rather than wait for a collapse.
Man sorry you got that dumb flag. Doesn't make sense. It is one of the better dd that I've seen recently. Nicely put together with useful information but not too dense. Anyway grabbed 1k shares and I'm up bigly üòÅ
Pltr is shit and GME isn‚Äôt
Everybody always saying ‚ÄúRIP bears‚Äù. They‚Äôve all been dead for a while. I think we can stop that now
You still might profit, but generally buying OTM calls that expire next day is very stupid. Its always safe to just buy slightly ITM calls for a bit longer period out
This DD was really good and posted in like November
Got in below $8 and again at $9. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

This is so unhelpful. Trading is hard to learn. That's why 95% of people fail at it. A brother is trying and making his way AND he turned a profit. Why bother with the 'index fund kool aid' bit?

Bill Gates could probably have made more putting his savings in an index fund than his first year starting Microsoft.
Its already spiking in the mornings to 43-44. I believe LOGITECHs earnings may bump it to high 40s next week
Expire tomorrow... are they worthless or ITM?
I suppose that's possible, but they write most of the options at least on one side.
Will be yolo-ing 1k in it. It's not much but it's all I've got
Nice 80% increase today!

This is an interesting article on the potential of the retirement age changing for Social Security and the impact on benefits.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/how-raising-the-social-security-retirement-age-could-affect-benefits.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/how-raising-the-social-security-retirement-age-could-affect-benefits.html)

As much of this community plans to retire well before SS kicks in I am interested to hear if anyone was counting on this in the later years.  My plan is to not count on Social Security but hope its there as an extra cushion.
If it's one sell order it should be categorized as one round trip.

Worst case, you can let them expire worthless and lose whatever you paid for them.

Margin is borrowed money. Robinhood (or any broker) makes money on margin by charging interest on anything you borrow. 

Many brokers will allow you to borrow margin at a rate of 1:2 to hold overnight. This means that if you have $10k, you can borrow a total of $10k margin. Just like any mob boss, Robinhood expects you to pay back the loan (go figure). If your account value drops below the margin maintenance requirement, they are at risk of losing their initial loan and will either issue a margin call or forcefully sell some of your assets to make back the loan. Most brokers will give you a couple of days to resolve a margin call before forcefully selling anything (assuming the value doesn't continue to drop).

While the standard margin overnight borrow rate is 1:2, many brokers also allow you to borrow even higher ratios for day trading. TD Ameritrade offers day trade buying power at a 1:4 ratio. All of this additional margin must be sold at the end of each day (or you will again enter a margin call). 

Stocks that are more volatile will have an additional margin concentration requirement. If a stock has a concentration requirement of 50% and you are using margin, you cannot invest more than 50% of your total portfolio into that stock without inflicting a margin call. 

Margin maintenance is recalculated at the start of each trading day. As long as your account value is above the new maintenance level when it is recalculated, then you will exit the calll... Although if you enter the call again that same day it might count as a continuation of the previous days call??

Over the past few years I've entered margin calls only a handful of times. To avoid calls I make it a habit to only borrow a maximum of 75% of my margin balance and keep 50% of my portfolio in long term growth stocks (ones that don't have concentration requirements). This means that if I have a 1:2 ratio and $10k in my account, I will generally swingtrade 75% or $7.5k margin. This gives me a bit of a buffer incase my stocks decide to walk off a cliff that day. Anything over 1:2 I will sell at the end of the day regardless of my profit/loss.

I actually vividly remember this, lost some money back then and just gave up. But literally back in that time, it was 9/10 a fade and youd profit going the other way lmao. crazy how times have changed.
If you can guess the market right, and you're not getting screwed by the market, yes.  Absolutely.  Hands down, 1000%.

But on average you're not right.  You're going to get it wrong.  You will lose these calls.  Look at the loss porn.  Study them.  Those are calls.  If they bought shares and just held and moved on with their lives they'd be fine.

The honest most accurate call- and this is the most boring answer- is to have time in the market and to not to try to time the market.

Just buy some shares in something you think works, or you have a hunch on, and forget about them till a few years later or when the market rallies on something and you think you need to make a move.   And just keep piling on new shares, market up or down.  It adds up.

They exercised a 40 call at the 41 strike point when for a 3$ profit instead of selling it to the market for 8$? Are you sure?

When exactly do you think these were exercised?

And rockets
Goldman going to the moon?
Those projects are already being funded. It's not a pipedream. There are already billions of dollars being pumped into these projects. They aren't creating rockets to do nothing my friend.

I've also worked on Lunar Gateway projects at my college in collaboration with NASA, so I know quite a bit about their roadmap and plans. There is already money invested into making this happen at this very moment stuff is being researched and developed.

Also, I don't know if you have paid any attention, but the space industry is swinging toward the private sector because private companies are showing better results and promise of much higher profit margins. Look at SpaceX for example and companies such as Relativity, Rocket Lab, and Axiom (to name a few). These are companies built privately who are making a way into the market by showing faster progress than bigger companies with bigger budgets.

Stop making statements that you have no basis for. You lack understanding about the industry and that's okay, bit stop making uneducated assumptions.

Adding one thing here: 

The further a call is from an expiration date, the more time value it has (eg. there's more time for the stock price to rise even more), which factors into the option price too.

So if your call has shot up in value, then waiting until expiration might lose you $ if the stock price plateaus, as there will be time value decay. 

I'm also rtrd when it comes to this but pretty sure this is true

3:45? More like 3:59. But if GME is at 45, I'd definitely dump or substantially downrisk at that point. Some chance of an accepted share selloff on tuesday, but less likely than the monetized call selloff friday. If Tuesday open was up, I'd be totally out at that point.

Uhhh no.

Mr. Biden will detail his plans, which he and his economic team have been honing for weeks, in an evening speech in Delaware. The efforts will cover the pandemic, the economy, health care, education, climate change and other domestic priorities, Brian Deese, the incoming director of the National Economic Council, said at the Reuters Next conference on Wednesday.

...

The proposals in the second tranche are likely to be larger than the first, and Democrats plan to pay for all or some of them by raising taxes on corporations and the rich. The second package is expected to be centered on job creation and infrastructure, including hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on clean energy projects like electric vehicle charging stations, along with health care and education spending, Mr. Biden‚Äôs team and leading congressional Democrats have indicated.
In all honesty it worries me a tad. Having financial knowledge is paramount. But many people who I‚Äôve talked to that got into stocks aren‚Äôt ‚Äòinvesting,‚Äô they‚Äôre trading. They will ask me about a stock, but none of them ask me about a balance sheet or cash flow or portfolio construction. At some point this will matter. Though I don‚Äôt know when. For a lot of people I think automated investing into ETFs is the best cost/benefit situation.

But many will realize that we do live in a capitalist world and owning stakes in businesses is a great way to accrue wealth, which ultimately leads to more freedom.

I‚Äôm very excited for the long term out some of more democratized markets. The commission-free world will undoubtedly have growing pains. But overall I view it as a good thing. Just get ready for the ride.
These never ending hit pieces won‚Äôt shake my diamond hands.

When I die, put my PLTR shares in the grave
There is that‚Äôs right but there‚Äôs so many factors that a forced liquidation of a big short could ruin your thesis so be careful
Yes
Yeah, I always respect people who can see a crash coming and get out (or profit on the way down with shorts).  We need the pessimists and realists, especially in bubble mania.  The problem seems to be that so few know when to *get back into the market* that limits the upside, even if you're a genius and spot the correction coming the day before it happens.

When is he supposed to be doing this speech
ü§ûüèª
Look at your open interest
üôÑ And what is wrong? Marxist, communist, socialist, capitalist. Everybody have his right to go the way he want and to talk about his opinion. That initial post was very good and had no political connection.. üôÑ If Nio owners like the car, it‚Äôs good? Us people just don‚Äôt want to accept that communists maybe can build a better car than Tesla.
Not really. Aren't the odds a dealer hits a 6 in roulette a year from now the same odds as him hitting it the next spin? Assuming the casino stays open
There has been a ton of DD on GME. Here is just one of many examples giving highlights as to why GME is positioned to move. The main motivator is short interest outweighs float, and Ryan Cohen and his team joining the board.

Apple is like a 2 trillion dollar company.  Apple making every single robo taxi that the entire planet uses and having a monopoly on the entire industry is priced into that market cap.

What the fuck, it‚Äôs up 22%
Going to need pumps for all these dips I'm bagholding lol
Gambling I‚Äôm fine with that
What the fuck
I think our new strategy is to just jump between short squeeze opportunities. Jump on every new opportunity and fuck these bears raw.
Hey guys, buy more AMD. Its at a near low for the month and quarterlies are coming up in two weeks.
Yeah, that's exactly it.  You're paying for the convenience and certainty of sale.  You might get less than you're expecting/hope, though.  The fees can be high depending on the situation and amount of renovations they deem necessary.
Only 1200 shares here but I think we're good homie. Last night I did some DD and only negatives were I feel like the Hyundai partnership was way overstated, and considering the body on top of the car largely doesn't matter I wish they'd show a sexier design. That toaster design is a real turn-off to some judging a book by its cover not digging deeper to realize the body design concept means shit for these cars since they all share the same chassis anyway.

Still feeling bullish because I don't see any red flags - we'll get a pop soon. I just added more shares to my position at the closing price.
I‚Äôm deep ITM in yolo right now
If I were to pick TD, Fidelity, Etrade, etc etc, which is the best option? I'm in Pacific Time

In relation to GME and the short squeeze, what happens when a member of retail buys a put? Does it have any effect?
I hate this shit so much but I'm loaded with calls and holding
Sounds like Melvin trying to instigate some sell off. Been seeing a lot of these today. Good effort.
My 2 whole shares salute your 15 with pride and admiration.
You remember what IV was when you bought in?
Oh I agree, financial independence is the fuckin' GOAL for me too. The benefit of not working on happiness cannot be understated. But until you get there, most of us suckers cobbling a nest egg together, the value of cash flow of (in OP's case above) $100K annually toward that nest egg cannot be understated either. For the average upper-middle class joe every $100K you can throw at retirement and investments has incredible potential imo
It‚Äôs literally up 70% already wtf are u talking about
When squeeze is squozing, everyone will want that call.
So  what's the next GME, BB? AMC?  
i need money to satisfy my girlfriends before jamal steals her from me
Yes, the deeper ITM they are the less volume there will be, which tends to lead to a larger gap between bid & ask.

Hope you all bought your puts. Mooning for the stimulus was too obvious. 3 day weekend too.
I bought 100 shares of Carnival in March at $10ea and it has doubled in price. I originally bought in order to cash in on the onboard credit they give you if you own 100 shares, so i figured that over time, with enough cruises it would pay for itself. I may sell this March though and be happy with the 100% profit. Time will tell.

It is hard to understate how much having a kid will change your life and your relationship with your partner. Family decisions are a higher order question than FIRE timeline.

Children will slow your wealth accumulation. They will slow your travel experience. They will limit your social opportunities. They will give you perspective and force you to grow. Kids will change your life- you either want to buy the ticket or you don't, FIRE is not a special consideration in this domain. 

Also paying off debts is savings. Might make you feel better about your progress.

Truly baffling
a - Dump, into the teens 

b- Dump, into the 20s

c - Flat if not broker liquidated, and then stock can go up easier the following week because the float would get really narrow.
I regret not buying more calls at open. Got one leap but was planning to get some monthlies/quarterlies too and then got distracted until after IV soared

I also bought a few that expire in February in case the stock lollygags tomorrow/next week.
Contrary to what people gonna tell you "INDEX FUNDS TO DA MOON" I believe congrats to you and I think stock picking is the future. Another thing look into options trading whole different animal but much more rewarding be prepared to lose money until you get good.

I didn't all in, just made a sensible though large bet.
It sold the news after CES, and yeah people thinking the new CEO will magically fix Intel's massive manufacturing problems.
What are you buying, stock or options? And how long are you planning to hold?

I think earnings will be great, especially given the huge covid boost. But sometimes the market has a weird reaction to AMD earnings so it's honestly hard to say - Just look how irrational the stock is right now over the new Intel CEO. If you are holding for a few months I wouldn't sweat about it, and if you're planning to hold long term then it might be worth buying Xilinx stock instead (if you think the buy out will happen). You would get 1.7234x AMD shares in return if it happens. 
If you're yoloing options then I suggest getting more advice from r/amd_stock

Except their balance sheet and earnings are positive, and they've had over 300% growth in e-commerce. I don't think it will go up to $200 and stay they, but it'll get short squeezed until the bears are dry and probably settle back down to $40-50.
Too risky and the interest is way too high.  Use margin of you have to or get a second job only for stocks.

The rocket is already out of the atmosphere now. You should start praying to Melvin to keep it away from the moon for 1 more day.

They expire tomorrow, so they will be at their intrinsic value. I don't want to sell the calls, because only MM is buying the calls right now. Need to soak up as many shares as possible to lock up the liquidity and lower supply. Low supply +high demand
Also, this is a super embarrassing question, but I don‚Äôt know what an IPO is, and even when googling it, I don‚Äôt seem to find any sites that can explain everything in layman‚Äôs terms for beginners, do you have any website recommendations?

I actually started my investments by analyzing my budget and cutting out luxuries including starbucks, started buying $8 wine instead of $20, cutting out a few movie channels I didn't watch, things like that that added up a a few hundred a month that went into stocks.

Thanks for that. Very, very helpful.

As I've only traded stocks I've grown to try and buy on down days when an opportunity arises. No way to time the bottom but it helps me psychologically to accept large changes in a stock if I don't buy on FOMO days.

I guess what I'm trying to understand is it a stock takes a sharp dip one day I know exactly what I'm getting that share at in comparison to what it was before the movement.

How is that same movement measured in an option? Is it best to buy an option on a down day..or is that downward movement going to be reflected in the options contact the following day? 

Does the timing matter as much?

You technically are with the management fees of \~45bps (if I remember correctly). That's in the not egregious, but not cheap range. I think fair for getting broad market exposure and a passive manager. There are other ETFs where I would not pay that (for example, IPAY as it is fairly easy to put together a portfolio of Visa, Square, PayPal, and Mastercard, and you generally should do better).

Well, if you are long the stock you could do that, but if you buy the 0 dte put, and it comes into the money in the liquidation selloff near the close, it gets swept up too because my broker won't want me holding 50k shares short of GME on margin unless I have a few million in cash sitting around. The brokerage liquidation rules are the challenge with that, since the greatest selling would likely be out of those same brokerage liquidations.

Hell yeah! A little over a week ago I didn't know shit about stocks or options but thanks to the retards here I've doubled my 2k investment in that time.  And thanks to APHA/TLRY of course. I've put 1k in APHA stocks, 500 in TLRY and 500 for 10x 11$ APHA calls expiring 1/29. It's going to the fucking moon! Especially after Biden announces legalization or decriminalization later this month. 

I've only made 2k but this shit it's so exciting I think I'm slightly autistic now. I only wish I had more capital to spend right now.

everything basically has a 100% chance of having a dump day once they get that overbought.

He has never set a precise squeeze valuation.  He‚Äôs actually mentioned many times that it‚Äôs extremely hard to predict when/what will happen in a squeeze scenario, and he tries to stay away from that.  He was investing in GameStop based off of just the fundamental valuation.

Originally he thought the ‚Äúinfinity squeeze‚Äù was actually a really low chance of happening.  But now with more recent events, it‚Äôs become more probable.  Still no guarantee it‚Äôll happen.

In one of his first videos he posted, it‚Äôs titled ‚ÄúGameStop $5 to $50‚Äù.  So it seems his original targets were thinking they could be worth $50 a share if all went to plan.  But that was even before Ryan Cohen invested/joined the board of GameStop.  Now that he‚Äôs on the team, all bets are off for what the future holds.  

$50+ is extremely realistic now, and $100+ within the next couple years is possible too, again assuming all goes to plan. This is just based off Fundamentals alone, nothing to do with the MOASS.

What they aren't telling you is that options decay over time. If the share price is flat or even increases but not at the rate you need it to, you'll bleed money until it's all gone.

I think this varies a lot by industry.  As a former software developer that did tons of interviews, for example, I can say I genuinely did not care about titles, only current ability.  But I can easily see where that might not be the case in a different field.

Do you have any visibility into the hiring process in your current gig? How heavily is title weighed?
What makes you say that?

Well, I have a new sub to explore. Thank you!
Right after the new year - it was like 5% per day for  4-5 days people rushed back (myself included "as it was a bargain" then by ~March down another 30-40%.
I'm a poor boy but I don't need much! With this, I'm essentially financially independent... Which is a fucking blessing.
Should I sell my MSFT stocks and put it all into $BB tomorrow?
Roaring Kitty, you are the man! I will follow you forever into Valhalla! GME GANG RIDES AGAIN!
If you're investing based on WSB trends, better to be early. Still a dumb move without doing your own outside research, but YOLO!

üöÄ
I do. I will write a DD post. Basic thesis is simple:

F150 is the Macbook of rural America. The boomers want to pump this thing. Americans are leaving cities. They have the fed backing them and money to license tech from whoever they need to. All they need to do is keep pace with regulations, slash their stupid SKUs like hybrid sedans, and sell trucks like there‚Äôs no fucking tomorrow. They‚Äôre the Vietnam of stocks dude. They don‚Äôt need to win, just not lose.
Citi says downgrade? I hear FIRE SALE! ALL IN PLTR
sry bb I only fuck boys who don't take 5 years to hit 5 digits in karma :/
BB is the new GME, let‚Äôs go boyssssss

I'm not sure if I got lucky or the hundred hours of YouTube and reading did it for me. But I turned $120 into $1000 my first week with calls. I was busy at work and fucking sold too early and missed out on $4000 though. I also put $1000 into "safe" stocks and that's up like $200 already.
Our time will come we got some stuff coming up like that presentation bullshit they are doing in January also those job offerings at Allianz where they looked for PLTR folks but PLTR doesn't have a contract with Allianz yet so we might see such a contract anytime now. Just hold that shit and we will have our time no doubt, PLTR is too big and too important to fail trust me I'm a retard

But what if there isn't a big demand for electric vehicles like we first thought, since we are driving less and working from home?
It‚Äôs just the shell. They‚Äôve been inactive for years.  Any trading on the ticker since August has been on anticipation of the merger with Ameca Mining.

Yes, you lock in profits but you can always come back and cry here when you realize how much you lost in unrealized gains (like I did yesterday).

Although to be fair, you at least sold the call at $6 unlike me who sold lots of $28c at $0.15 each on Monday. RIP me lol.

PLTR, the abandoned prodigal son of WSB, is going to see a massive spike tomorrow. The downward pressure we've seen this week is just compressing that spring, ready to pop all over again. I'm looking for $27 by end of day.
Sir
A few more weeks it says.
If it isn't mentioned tonight, that would fuck a lot of us in the a hole. I got 1/22 ICLN leaps, so I'm not TOO worried, but I want bank.

Have mega shares in ICLN + PBW.
I don't really see why it wouldn't print. We have a year to sit on it. Sure, it needing to grow by around 130% from its current price to break even seems like a tall order, but dontcha think just the hint of the legalization of marijuana would cause the stock to moon? While some may argue that the current price already that speculation taken into consideration, I remain hopeful that there is much more room to grow. I believe Democrats having control of Congress will have a positive effect overall. 

At the time, I actually did a little math when I was trying to decide on whether to get the $30, $40c, $50c, $60c. I just assumed I had a certain amount of cash to burn through, compared it to how many contracts I could get at those strike prices, and picked up the strike price I believed would yield me the most profit by taking in gamma/delta into consideration. That's how I arrived at the $60c option being more profitable than the $40c or the $50c. It never even crossed my mind whether or not it may actually hit that strike price a year from now. 

Keep in mind that as much as I want the stock to shoot way past its strike price, I actually don't even think about if it would or would not. I'm totally okay with collecting on whatever profit there is even after a day or month or several months of holding.
Tomorrow is going to be crazy.

That seems like it should be enough. Try going to you‚Äôre investment profile, should be under your account. Put your experience to expert and goal to speculative training. I heard this has worked for some people
It's a steaming pile of shit that's getting short squeezed.  Some of these guys will make money, the first ones in will make a lot.  Most of these guys will be bagholders.

Yeah. I think I'm just going to trade the stocks on my own rather than the ETF. Cathie charges too high fees and she may include 3d printing companies and such. I'd rather build my own "ETF" based on what she's looking at.

Yea I don‚Äôt mind giving advice. I actually work in the industry and am licensed, although not a financial advisor and my friends know that. And the reasons you mentioned are why I would never tell a friend to purchase any Tesla, pltr, gme etc. because as soon as I do, the stock tanks and they get upset.  

When financial conversations come up I just kind of start talking about it and depending on the response I get ‚Äúman I need to start investing‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat stock do you like‚Äù I will either go more in depth or kind of just shut the conversation down.

The 1 friend (best man at my wedding) who started in July went from asking me if putting money into a Roth was the same as putting money into the market and spending $400 a month on a whole life policy for 250k that his dad was the beneficiary of to now where he‚Äôs maxed out 2019 (due to tax extension), almost maxed 2020, and will be working on 2021 and done it while building a decent emergency fund as well. He‚Äôs got a financial plan and he feels good about finances. Most people don‚Äôt have that.

Long story short, in general maxing a Roth is a smart financial decision for just about anyone, and as the original comment I replied to mentioned, most people don‚Äôt really realize they can and have the means to put their money to work to put themselves in a great financial position.
I‚Äôll give one upvote for that info

I'm new to this as well. I was wondering what happens if you sell an option without actually buying it first? Do you then essentially owe whoever bought the contract 100 shares if they exercise the option?

Solid as a diamond.
christ I saw that too.  I was up +$6k on $6k investing and I wanted to pull the trigger but I couldn't be a gay bear.  Now I'm down $432.
Yeah it‚Äôs up to you really.  I look at this as trying to maximize my gain with a simple strategy.  

I‚Äôm experimenting this year to help my sister and some friends who are investment noobs and very risk adverse.  I‚Äôve been trying to get them more into options trading to grow their accounts (for lack of a better word, they‚Äôre essentially ‚Äúpoor‚Äù).  I‚Äôve been having really good success with credit spreads and have been earning about 15% weekly on various trades I regularly do but it seems a bit over their head.  

Anyway I suggest rolling your weeklies and dumping the quarterlies.  The ones I picked are because of yield and calendar. 

HNDL is supposed to yield 7% yearly
KBWD is close to 10%
YYY also close to 10%

If any yields start dropping, I‚Äôll look for something else to replace it for that fits the schedule
ATOM hitting 42.0 with it
apparently how? I've had positions since 2015.

In principle yes, it would be his brokerage firm that does it & they could as long as he consents to it (usually implied in the contracts but Cohen can also withhold permission). Cohen can recall any lent shares at any time he wants them to but there's no added benefit to him doing so other than short squeeze, & I don't think he really cares too much about it in the first place

Same boat. Plus wrote calls for a 01/29 02/05 but holy hell they are holding their value for 26C, 26.5C, 28C. I'm bullish but I don't care if these fuckers sell on the way up

No idea but my guess is that people use a simpleton reasoning (as the majority of people here are doing) and think their market cap should equal chewy which is around 40b. At 18 price, woof was about 7b in mkt cap so a 100?
Before all of you with paper hands do what you do best understand that ICLN is an ETF. An ETF with stock worldwide. 30% is in the United States. Biden's Stimmy Bill isn't going to do much. People like me are shilling it because it's a good long term investment. Over a year. People here crying because it's not doing the same shit it did last week this week are the reason why it's shitting the bed. Get into QCLN if you want more American companies. Do super basic amount of DD and see what's actually in this ETF and you'll understand why when Biden announces green energy additions to the bill ICLN doesn't move much. I'm totally expecting it to tank once more tomorrow when people wake up to that idea. Like I'm genuinely embarrassed for the people crying all over this thread about it being a red week.

This is so true. It's also important to think about things from the perspective of large institutions or families with generational wealth. Risk doesn't really matter that much in your investments accounts that total like, $400,000. You'd look at risk a lot differently if you were dealing with money in the hundreds of millions or billions. Suddenly, even gambling that the United States will exist in 30 years will make you sweat.
I‚Äôd like to buy a vowel...‚ÄùE‚Äù,.
Ding! One E on the board.

I‚Äôd like to solve, GME?!
Yeah, I swapped all my Feb 35c for Feb 30c and I'm much happier for it. They have low theta and high delta. Good gains will be made if ICLN goes up even 10%, and I would be able to hold even until expiry and still make money.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever since DASH pop up on their daily trade posts.

Agreed. I‚Äôve been progressively loading Siri the past few weeks. I have 1130 shares (yeah, don‚Äôt give me shit about buying actual shares and not calls) at $6 cost now. Grossly undervalued, imo.
do you have data for this? That doesn't make sense to me because if that was the case theyd be paying a large premium to do so. In addition it would mean that shorts are buying calls.

I can‚Äôt enjoy this meme because this scene has me in my feels
Well maybe because it went from 43 to 65 in a matter of a couple weeks, broke 100 billion market cap, and is more expensive than tsla, which is saying something.

I too have that same position.  It‚Äôs already super tendie.  I can‚Äôt even imagine it at 30, would be a 5 close to 6 bagger for sure for me.
You could have just googled the definition.

In stock trading terms, it's something or someone that triggers a reaction to the stock and/or market. i.e. Jeff Bezos files for bankruptcy, Amazon shares down 99%. Elon Musk buys Amazon for $50 billion. Amazon stocks jump 100000% percent. Elon Musk buys Facebook for 1.5x it's valuation and DELETES IT! Facebook shares = $.000000000 delist. Elon Music now richest man in the galaxy worth 500000,0000000,00000000000,000000000 MEGA GAJILLION

Unbelievable
I didn't mean to but through my plays today I have ended up 84% in stock that can't be named and 9% in GME 2/5 44c down 20%.

TLDR sleeze ball Wall Street rats mad that they can't manipulate the market as fully without more effort.
Technicals haha
For reals though?
Reading is hard so I skipped to the bottom for a TL'DR saw rockets. YOLO confirmed
My retirement is all in your hands as of today, all in on BB
This has to be the trade of the year. Hell the trade of the decade. What realistically can beat this?
It‚Äôs up 100% in 2 days...when does the squeeze happen if not now?
Orbital Energy and BB! Already up 160 in 2 days on Orb and yolo-ing 1k into BB
If you are in the market congrats. Because we are going to be a bull market all year. Expect to see more news about beefcorn being used in shady deals. Dems will call to regulate beefcorn, pop the corn market and that wealth will have no where to go but options. Because let's be real, people playing the corn markets are even more of a degenerate then us.
DFV Hands gang checking in
BB
Oh you‚Äôll know
Is BB for real?
Don't buy I'

TA doesn't matter. Just follow the obvious thing that MARA and RIOT track. Looks terrible AH.
Imagine how hard the GME board room is laughing their asses off

Post retirement, working part time on freelance commercial gigs and teaching a Continuing Ed class.  It‚Äôs just the right amount of involvement w people I like, and pays half-decently.
Took me five minutes DD to realize I want to stay away from this. As I commented on another TANH thread, I was unable to find anything regarding their EV offerings outside of press releases. 

i.e. a press release would tout how they have a new big customer contract to purchase x product from them, but I was unable to find any evidence of x product's existence via a simple google search. Literally took me just 5 minutes to see the red flags...
Lol
Are we rotating out of gme and into bb??
Everyone needs an exit strategy. Best of luck!!!

Perfect time to buy though. Buy the dip.
Bought BB and more GME 10 minutes before close. Thinking of buying BBBY tomorrow, and retirement on Monday üöÄüöÄ

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven   
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
Lots of interest just before close so I'm hoping for the best.
How the fuck do you people think of these trades
I have to average down I bought a few weeks ago and it‚Äôs been bleeding. A long call is what I‚Äôm looking at tomorrow. I think they‚Äôll have a good year. Reopening and stimmy
Just imagine if we somehow push GME to a trillion dollar market cap

Biden has two speeches planned between now and the 22nd. I would hold for sure, if he mentions decriminalization or legalization they're going to go up again.

So you're locking up 6x the amount of money for a single month, making the same yield on something that would allow you to have 100% liquidity in 2 days.

omega yikes.
its not locked if you roth conversion ladder it
So many put and call contracts expiring tomorrow.  Either way it's going to be insane.
to invest in it.
I'm not one to believe that GME is going to even reach half of what VW did, but you are absolutely insane if you think GME is mostly retail traders. Absolutely bonkers that you think that's even possible.
Damn I bought Disney on the high side ($181). What's up with it going down?

BB is going to moon all year.
I haven't sold jack shit during this run up. I got a price target of 9 billion market cap. We're at what? 2.78b. For a company that makes 7b/year during the end of console cycle on top of a pandemic where 90% of their stores are closed.  With Cohen at the helm now? This should be trading at 3x rev like the other e-commerce. 18b price target.

He has said that, because he knows the average person will not put in the time, and research to know how to invest well. 

He preaches to the average person that just wants to live their life and put little thought into their investments.

Great investors know how to balance prudence, and aggression because they have confidence in their abilities that was hard earned.
Just don't be retarded.
Portfolio diversity üòè
If it's ITM, there will be a bid.
Yes, for a call that‚Äôs how it works. Whenever you‚Äôre going to be a contract Fidelity shows you the max loss, if you want to use them.
I'm on the fence with GME lol
Dude you haven‚Äôt made that money yet until you take it out and spend it... remember that.... otherwise it‚Äôs just numbers on screen
My retirement is all in your hands as of today, all in on BB
All I hear is üõªüìà
That‚Äôs irrelevant to the situation.
I didnt even know about this (Canacuck here)  you just ruined my whole fucking mood man. fuck off
I was up $260 on my 1 call 4 days ago.. now I‚Äôm down $70.... let‚Äôs hope shes shoots back up. May consider buying more calls if it dips any more

ahh I remember when my portfolio went +100% for the first time...took me about a week to wipe out all those gains and more

be careful and don't get cocky
Triple witching is the theory that something mysterious could happen and vol breaks and whatever.

Pink pants has some great footwork.
Ooooooooooooooooooof
Right, but as someone trying to hedge a long position even if it gets swept I still make money based on how much it was liquidated for. If I buy 20 $39p and in the last 30 minutes GME tanks down to $20, even if my broker liquidates the position 5 minutes before close I'll still probably make more money than I would buying puts for next week.
? Did this post before you were finished? Cause if you're trying to make a point that I'm supposed to be understanding, you'll need more than one added word to convey it.
Be me find all the good buys at 1am, forget to pull trigger at open lose massive gains on multiple buys that I wished to procure.
The market represents all future earnings of the underlying securities.  With near-zero interest rates, and a vaccine on the horizon, the market is looking far past this temporary hurt.

I guess they are worthless because they are both negative. 1/15 MARA $27 C (-42%) and TLRY 17$ P (-20%) 1 contract each.
who is the user who posted his year in where he does his research, buys 1 stock only, and then moves on to the next one after it hits his target?  It was a year in post I think.

Gme has been losing money year after year.

Pltr posted profit last Q if you learn to read financial statement plus understand how direct listing works.

fuck those cocksuckers for downgrading pltr
Disaster for the shorts
Lmao, I have my longterm investments account that's all boring and such and I have my margin account. 

I opened my margin account in February. I thought the market would go crazy because of the virus growing in China. Dropped a bunch of money in puts, but I lost most of it. Drop some more to make "sure" plays with calls, lost most of it. I decided to be safer in my gambles and go for the üöÄmeme stocks, lost the rest of it. I'm back to my weekly contributions to boring, safe etfs.
Maybe, depends if you like paying for air to breathe by the gallon
You can choose to exercise and buy the stocks, but if you don‚Äôt it expires and you lose the premium you paid
literally American Psycho irl. incredible

What brooker do u use? I can‚Äôt buy it on my Brooker ?
I‚Äôm killing it with my Alph call
I guess they are worthless because they are both negative. 1/15 MARA $27 C (-42%) and TLRY 17$ P (-20%) 1 contract each.
Also an interesting thing to point out is that roughly 20% of the float is shorted. Not nearly as much short selling compared to $GME, but still noteworthy. I think it could even get squeezed before earnings, and maybe earnings will really make it fly. I think it should definitely be on WSB Watch list. Can someone get u/DeepF*ckingValue to do an analysis?
Wait I'm the one that gave gold. Give it back!
lmaoooooooooo thank you for this
No. $150

You have to buy the stocks or get sent to Gitmo

Very true forgot about that, I dont doubt that Ryan and co has a plan in place for cloud gaming, what worries me is that Google is already leading and with the power necessary to fuel cloud gaming, I can only see Googles lead becoming even bigger in the future. Its a project perfect for Google, I know the meme is Google kills off all their projects but 90% of the time its things that either eat into some of their more successful projects or something that could easily be repurposed and added as a feature in another project. Stadia fits neither
500 shares at 7ish. It it til it literally sinks.
BB bro!
Omg GME finished
Just sent a GTC for 3 shares
Would a put not increase if the stock price decreases?
yah from now on, im thinking about just holding until a PT of $50 or $70
From what I gather they're out of the phone business and into cyber security big time now. Relative to comparable cyber security firms they are way undervalued. DYOR tho

DFV is a chad and a man of kindness, he will open a charity fund to handle all the money he got from these gains down in Texas.
Doubt we get above $100 on this quick upswing. Maybe we touch it briefly but then drop to $90 over the next week. If you are buying at least a month out I‚Äôd feel good about it
yeah, sure, but when?
I feel like since everybody is expecting GME to go up it‚Äôs gonna hit us with a pump fake.

You're welcome

At $9.45 now
fing amazing how people keep buying this shitt when it's been proven and proven again to burn you
I'm long AF. But you've gotta hedge especially when signs point to a sell off tomorrow.
I guess they are worthless because they are both negative. 1/15 MARA $27 C (-42%) and TLRY 17$ P (-20%) 1 contract each.
Good point. Bump it up to 75% per day.

I lovw the first comment. Someone roast that douche hahaha
I appreciate your post. Thanks for informing us, amigo!
There's a stellar one in Minnesota called X2 as well.
So is BB the new meme stock?
Yep tomorrow is probably going to be rough. Out of interest when did you buy those puts? Was it after this massive rally?
I don't think that applies to individual investors
I bought mara/riot puts eod. How am i looking
Why the fuck doesn‚Äôt chewie get a medal? I always hated that
This ain‚Äôt the squeeze yet, buckle up we‚Äôre just preparing for launch. This is just the beginning.
Well done!
Lol I know wtf Batman vs riddler over there. Spit it out brother! What does Tesla do on Friday‚Äôs? I‚Äôve seen it moon and sell off on Friday‚Äôs. Tesla is always shorted so quit the chinese finger trap stuff

It just expires worthless at that point
LUMN is dogshit. CenturyLink couldn‚Äôt get their stock moving by sitting on their hands and hoping their outdated fiber network would hold so they renamed themselves.
My RKT calls I bought yesterday are up 84% today, this is the play.

What the fuck are you talking about?
PLTR $29 by 2/5 or im I fucked?
Bulls make money, pigs make money, bears get slaughtered!
I am in India. 9:30 hours ahead. F1 student who came here in May. I know nothing of India and have a business in the US so more comfortable trading there
What‚Äôs the play?
If you wanna be the coolest person in the room, that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm here to buy my bitches happy meals in an F150.
so why is BB the next meme stock?
If you want to make it in this game, anytime you take a profit it's a good thing. Sure could you have made more? Yes, but if you had that sort of insight you'd be able to print infinite money. So just be glad you made money and not lost it friend.
Too early to tell
Can someone explain this call to me? Started trading yesterday and my platform doesn‚Äôt do calls (I‚Äôll move when there‚Äôs a decent one in the UK)

Anyone gonna buy this Amazon dip 

Especiallly under 3100 ??
We're in the same boat. How could I not sell CCs with 600% IV.
Why do you think so?
Just now getting to 2019 levels. With streaming blowing up the way it has we have potential for $75+  totally correct though, should have posted before. Too many people were jerking off to PLTR and GME to notice. Myself included
Best suggestion is to have an exit plan. Sell XX% shares at XX% gains. For instance you have 100 shares, set an exit price for 20 of them, than a higher exit price for 40, than an unreasonably high price for 20 and an unspeakable price for the reaming 20... Values depend on your risk tolerance... Stick to the plan! Good luck man! See you on the battlefield tomorrow!
ITM, most brokers will try to sell your contract before the end of market 

OTM, contract expires worthless
who long you gonna try to pump them?
Why are some tickers banned?
do you think ZM is a buy now?
God damn this movie is so good. Watched it for only the 2nd time the other night when I couldn't sleep and I think it's a top 5 movie for me
I am holding all GME and taking the extra money I'm getting from BNGO into my personal cash use and to reinvest back into BNGO. I'm essentially financially independent  today and I'm so fucking blessed.
BB turn around story.  Software, Cybersercurity, AI, Self-Driving, enterprise secure phones.  BB under valued at 5billion
Good job retard. First one's free
This isn‚Äôt manipulation. It‚Äôs public, everyone can see it, people can buy or not buy.
so that would be even better for all of us i‚Äôm assuming.
Same cept this morning... Already up 13%
if it below 35 it expires u lose all the money you paid
xd
Dave Ramsey dat you?
Yeah it was a surprise, probably glossed it over when the law came about and never thought about it since. Too bad I didn't ask about it in my offer, oh well time to pay the tax man
It‚Äôs literal serendipity most times, in this case he grabbed an OTM contract right before a squeeze.
Thanks for making me feel important too. Meanwhile, I will continue to live vicariously through the big dawgs
Can we pump bb to 20 shit is prime
69.420
if deepfuckingvalue is in, count me in
Bought at 18 sold at 19 so the guy who bought it at 19 could sell it for 20. It's called passing the buck and it's what makes WSB so great.
Yup, that‚Äôs the fucking ballz play.
I‚Äôll buy your  option comrade. I will make sure to save enough just for you.
I thought it was Order 66?
Worth it just going all in on IPOE shares or am I really missing out by not buying calls.

Help me fathers - may the tendies be with you. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
I sell covered calls through Vanguard every week.  Vanguard is a perfectly cromulent broker for that kind of trade.
What‚Äôs a good call to make on $BB for tomorrow? Seriously no idea what I‚Äôm doing.
Btw how did you know to look so early? Trying to find smart plays like this rather than getting in for .84 cents and stuff
Tech stonks got scared. Small peepee
Wait, what? I have karma?
Low volume draw down with extremely large buying at close. Looks like ATHs next month or even an opex ramp tomorrow. Should be fun!
She is probably better than most of the retards here who only understand Robinhood and never touched thinkorswim
I did the same shit yesterday. Bought again today, went red and I told myself this time I'm riding it into the ground. Fuck it.
2k shares :)
You son of a bitch, I'm in.
If closes at $35 or higher you buy the 100 shares at $35. If closes under you have nothing.
$BB was at $8.07 when I commented on this. 8.5c 1/15 went from $0.20 -> $0.80.
Budget porno would have better more gains.
I'm betting on a sea of good news coming out AH Friday so hype can permeate through the long weekend.
If it expires the police come and get you. Dont let that happen
Not on Fidelity, you have to sign up for the program.  Fidelity doesn't even let me set a limit that far away from the price its messed up.
Squoze
Thanks for the work you put in. Amazing that Soros has a piece of it. Just hope he won't dump it quick like he did Palantir...
I had emails I wasn‚Äôt sure were best to share publicly at the time. Plus, I couldn‚Äôt figure out to remove the permission requirement on my Google Doc.  XD
Bought calls from the insider training dd week of Christmas. Sold all for a loss except the 10$ contracts. Up 1k today lol. Was going to let it go to zero because it was at .04 any ways.
Need PLTR to moon, sheetco*n and CCIV... am I fcked?
He has a really good 4 minute video that gives his reasonings.

Yes that is exactly what I think aswell, however the price just went to fucking 245. Clearly shows a lot of panic. And everyone hates FB.
BB will become so big it will buy AMZN in 5 years
Correct
those calls were green a long time ago
if it‚Äôs out of the money it‚Äôs worthless, if it expires in the money you can exercise
Let's just go all in. It's that easy  üöÄüöÄüöÄ
we'll see. still super jacked up here with rsi at 83. i think you'd like to see a 70s rsi and a 10-20% correct before getting in again

this thing and FCEL basically doubled in a week remember, and it's not like they were coming off lows.
yuck!

I mean fruit and salmon?! I can't
do I think that gambling is a better strategy than investing? no
Blackberry and Gamestock making people money? What is this 2005?

how did your aerospace position do today? i remember you were building a position into that a month ago.
Thanks for the tip. Bought 5 BB 02/05/2021 9.50 C. Already over 9.50 AH!

What app or site is that?
I don't know what to do with such profitable calls. Probably hold until '22
*95%
well it is true. i'm not a millionaire as I didn't play this stock. I have money set aside to add to current positions. I would maybe spend $5k on this gamble, but I'd rather take safer plays. I made some money on Disney+ but again, I try to minimize risk and rarely bet more than 1-2% of my portfolio.  
I realize you are trying to be a dick about this, but I provided you with information, take it as you will. don't get all butthurt you missed out on making money loser. also there's a whole bunch of millionaires now just go look on the main page retard.

So it's essentially a buy the position and hold until the price gets high enough that people start selling more then people are buying, which causes the price to fall back down?

Thanks to gme I now have 82k to play around with
Tsla AH news wow
Thanks. Didnt know that.
From yahoo:

Volume: 83k 
Open interest: 27k

Quite a bit.
Got like 20 calls been dying the past month earnings in feb and fell with the news of banning trump on Twitter and snap no other bad news don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt go back up I‚Äôm holding no matter what
Buy now in after hours. It‚Äôll be cheaper than at open!
People saying this are dumb.

1) Pelosi is balls deep in big tech.

Yahoo finance does this with options for some reason, you‚Äôll be fine.

But...but...I just got my account green .. lol
I saw rockets on the post
They just went up after they released their earnings so I would personally wait for a dip which is expected in the near future, but that‚Äôs just me.
Before they get IV crushed?

They are born in the crusher lol.

You should do well on a good day though.
Do you have funds to buy one more share tomorrow? Do it! I‚Äôm gonna buy one more share we should all spread the word to buy one more share

Well so far this hasn‚Äôt been a fools errand so that‚Äôs nice!
I'd hold till April at least, they've still got alot of growth potential with the amazon deal and as cyber security company which is becoming a massive industry.

Yes, if you are buying the option, not writing it
No. Momentum trading has slightly outperformed for the past few decades. Unfortunately, the WSB version involves too much emotion to not blow up your account most of the time.
Interesting, I hadn‚Äôt thought of that. Hopefully demand for EV increases as things get back to normal in the coming years

>I am interested to hear if anyone was counting on this in the later years

At least from what I remember from the fantastic ERN series, most retirement "failures" are due to a sequence of returns risk in the first few years of retirement. Therefore, SS doesn't really factor in for me because it starts too late to make a difference in most failure cases.

It might make more of one for someone retiring early but not *super* early, like at 55.

I bailed on SPG and BPY. Both saw a jump when the deal to rescue JCPenney was announced, but shopping malls are never recovering. What the internet first did to newspapers, it's in the process of doing to shopping malls. 

There will always be in-person shopping, but in order for retailers to survive, they're going to need to completely rethink their strategy and footprint. That's bad news for SPG and other REITs that have steep exposure to shopping malls.
Don‚Äôt worry no chance of me getting cocky as it‚Äôs constant fear lmao. Non of my friends are into investing so can‚Äôt tell anyone as they‚Äôll think I‚Äôm nuts.
What if u/deepfuckingvalue is Cramer
Which further proves that AAPL are mostly invested by boomers who only read charts and do fundamentals, stock market now runs on news and not value.
$69 by 4/20
by market close of 1/15, if icln isn't above 35, it expires and your money disappears, nothing happens. if it's over 35, you can buy 100 shares per contract for $35
BuT BiTcOiN Is AnOnYmOuS!
if they buy calls they will cause a stock runup. I don't think the shorts are buying calls except potentially extremely otm calls but those were added literally today. So this would be a new development
You regret taking your initial investment out?
Bought $SPCE at close, so now it's collapsing. 

Sell at open if it stays red??   hmmmmm.
Wow I was feeling like crap all week and this cheered me up a little lmao
Yoooo, I remember reading your comment and thinking that was impossible. 17.50 here üíéüôå
Awesome man! Let me know how you do in the future. Since you stsrted to perform better in the last months I wonder how it will go in the next
Time to get back in lol
Oh shit, down for 2 days straight?

So... Jeff Amazon. We just gonna slide around and not do shit?

Is this because your EX selling the shit outta the stock? What gives?
Approximately 25m, if we literally diamond hands them, would mean an infinity squeeze.

The problem is, shorts can hold on as long as they can keep adding to margin and paying borrow fees.  So the price would just slowly tick up forever.

Or at least a squeeze until GME issued new stock or until even Cohen was enticed out.
Thank you bro. Trying to get in touch with mods to remove the flair. üôåüèª
I don‚Äôt think $4, but I think there‚Äôs an honest case for $2.  Whether or not we get there, I‚Äôm not sure, but I think there‚Äôs a case for it.
Nice thanks ur right its cheap. Will try to buy tomorrow
Buy some puts man!!

What's your course of action if you're holding covered calls that have gone WAY past the strike price and are nearing assignment, but you still believe in the stock and it's growth potential.  Roll Up & Out and hope they expire on the next cycle?  Allow them to be assigned then buy back in? Hedge with purchase of additional calls? Curious what the room thinks, though I may regret my curiosity too knowing this bunch.
turns out I'm just dumb and my mutual funds went up 23% in 2020. I haven't done much stock trading yet but I don't know if I would be able to beat that return on my own?

Join the waiting game bro sooner or later they will go north. Never sell on a lose.
if you're interested in index funds, I highly recommend Bogle's work, he makes a pretty good case for investing in index funds for the risk-averse investor.
For real this is why the stock market will continue up. The power of the get rich dream is unmatched. Now we all have the opportunity. We don't need to start a company and grind or come up with some awesome idea. We just have to buy and sell the right shit at the right time. And it can happen in a matter of days. Everyone who is getting into the market will stay here. When they lose it all they will come back and bring friends with them. There will be more traders than ever before. This is only the beginning. This isn't a bubble like days past, this is a movement.

B fucking B
**Market:**	ESH21

**Date:**	14-Jan

**Attempted Direction:**	Down

**Rotation Factor:**	-12

**Range Extension:**	Seller

**Tails:**	Buyer

**Buying/Selling Composite:**	Selling comp

**One-timeframing (D/W/M):**	Day: OTing up, Week: Inside bar (Non trend), Month: OTing up

**Comments:**	"Thursday opened above value, but within range following a below-average volume ON session with just 13.5 points of range. The open type today was an open-auction, very little activity from buyers or sellers as the first 9 periods (A-J) traded through the open at some point in a similarly tight range compared to the ON session (13 points).

Buyers had a slight edge early in B period as they continued the daily one timeframing higher, but price was unable to reach the base of the buying spike on 1/8 (3816.5), indicating that that buyers weren't strong enough to overcome the responsive selling and were getting long at bad prices. Lower highs and lows were seen following B period as sellers slowly took control, they weren't able to find much continuation, however, until K period. 

A liquidation break began when K period took out the G period low and continued into the close, leaving a few single prints in L period as price headed back towards  the comp HVN at 3795 and resulting in a selling spike (spike base = 3803) within the short-term balance area of the last 6 sessions (including today)."

**Daily Volume:**	1.13m (lower)

**Volume Average (20):**	1.28m

**VA Placement (H/OL-H/L/OL-L/Unch):**	OL-Higher

**VA Width (Wide/Avg/Narrow):**	Average

**Directional Performance Relationship:**	Balancing, Strengthening

**Comments:**	Volume before the afternoon liquidation was well below average and acted to shutoff buying activity. When activity in one direction is not being effectively facilitated, price will move accordingly to begin increasing activity again, which in this case meant price moving down. Due to the lateness of the liquidation in the session, the dVPOC (3809) and dVA remained higher, but overlapping relative to yesterday.

**Tomorrow's Expectation:**	"Although we did see acceptance of higher prices today prior to the liquidation break, the selling acted as a rejection of these higher prices as we reverted back to previously established value below us at the comp HVN. This puts the market back into a neutral state where participants can conduct business at mutually accepted prices.

The gameplan within this short-term balance area remains unchanged at the moment, selling above balance VAH (3808.25) and buying below balance VAL (3787.5) provide good day timeframe opportunities targeting balance VPOC (3795).

Until we begin to see increased activity at/near the balance extremes, this range will continue to be traded. If one of the balance extremes is traded, I would caution placing trades in the direction of the possible breakout until there is confirmation that the breakout is valid. A false breakout and reversal seems to be the more likely scenario, IMO, especially to the downside (with reversal higher)."

Not sure, perhaps someone less retarded than me can answer that question. I suspect dropping ~$200,000,000 on the stock would have a very noticeable effect though.
Yeah, I agree . I‚Äôm thinking it was just the trump news . Snap has been a solid play for a while .. will probably buy more tomorrow if it‚Äôs red at all.. you know earnings gonna kill again.. and didn‚Äôt it shoot up like $10 after earnings last time ??
hmmm maybe not then. i wonder why its going up?

What are you looking for specifically in his videos? The Christmas update one was just a quick 3 minute video, it wasn‚Äôt a livestream.  

Usually his livestream videos have an intro and disclaimer page for the first 3-4 mins.  Then he hops on and takes a few sips of beer and gives an overall recap of recent events for the next 10-15 mins. He‚Äôll have a few tabs open on his screen, each with a different topic about GME.  Will spend a couple mins discussing each of them.  

After that, it‚Äôs about 4-5 more hours of talking to people through the Live Chat, answering questions, discussing everything GameStop, and just chillin out and drinking.  

Full disclosure: I have not watched the full 5 hours of any of his live stream videos.  But I‚Äôve watched 1-2 hours of a few of them.

I was tracking the option volume on the 40$ calls throughout the day (a chart would be nice)

This is the way they escape the short squeeze. Their calls are not excercised on the floor thus avoiding increasing the price and they return them to the lender. Yes they pay a premium but that‚Äôs the cost of doing business.
I lost almost $200 on it this morning.
Indeed, when buying options, whether they are calls or puts, max loss is limited to premium paid.

Selling options is where the loss can greatly exceed initial investment. When selling naked calls specifically, the potential loss is theoretically infinite.
They know it's a PnD.

If you want to contribute to the squeeze, buy shares! (or a mix of shares and options). Also wtf you playing the weekly games for?? It's not like you're going to lose that much upside playing monthly/quarterly and you won't be helping those bastard institutions keep afloat
You son of a bitch I'm In
Options are contracts you pay premium to purchase shares on a given day. Therefore, if it‚Äôs below 35 you‚Äôll definitely have got IV crushed before 1/7 and risk goes up. If it‚Äôs above you‚Äôll be allowed to grab the shares at the set price 35. Robinhood won‚Äôt execute if you don‚Äôt have the capital to get those shares
I‚Äôd fuck with that for sure
Absolutely not.
not it
Wow good? Wow bad?

Ok then
Imagine anyone other than DFV trying to claim they‚Äôre the GME Oracle.
You better believe it
Question: Will this help shorts cover and may cause a significant shake up tomorrow as the other options contracts expire?
Glad I dumped BABA to get in on GME!! Thank you Guys!!
There's this underground company called tesla. You should look into it

Bought GME 40c expiring tomorrow for $285. Am i fucked or will i be feasting bois? Any money i make from it will be used to buy shares
THANK YOU JIM CRAMER "Don't sell Tesla stock"
I‚Äôm thinking their only move for growth is to buy DTV from T. Curious if the recent movement is based on a coming announcement.
This is why we are here
Saying all that, I guess the wildcard though is American shale and how much they will ramp up production. Ideally covid would have bankrupted some and maybe led to some consolidation but it doesn‚Äôt seem like much happened
nah. BB has large short interest as well.
how?
It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs a fucking time traveler. Bought at the bottom calls that expire at the absolute top (more than likely). If there has ever been a case for a time machine, this dude has it.
Please make pltr shorts squeal like gme shorts

And then?
Can anyone loan me some money trying to buy 1 share of GME now that its at 40$
Same. I Yolod my entire down payment 45 mins ago. If this doesn't shit the bed, I'll be set
This happened with GRWG and I let them be assigned and then it took off past any point I could afford to keep selling options on it
Anyone not in GME and in cloudflare?
When do we get an update on the short interest
Any one of us would‚Äôve done the exact same thing at that point, let‚Äôs not kid ourselves. Even if we knew beyond the shadow of a doubt this was going $100+. The dude did nothing wrong here.

I still see 50,000 shares and even more $ in calls still in the game which obviously wouldn‚Äôt be if he thought this wasn‚Äôt going to continue rocketing.
It's not the next meme stock, it's just pumped by Discord groups. BB sold 90 patents to Huawei.
Fuck me üò≠
Well, you‚Äôre not completely out of the game yet, IV is keeping your calls alive for MARA - and TLRY still has about $20 of value.  You can sell them at open and take the PDT hit, or hope for the best and stocks moving in your direction.
Lol, Im still holding those PayPal stocks BTW- Cha Ching

Shoot im holding until next month!
Damn dude no need for bribes
You bought to open. 

So sell to close brudda 

Or hold until it expires worthless..

but if everyone just buys options how will we sqeeze
More like r/joketbatwentovermyhead
It would definitely be stupid to move my entire $1.3k baby account into GME tomorrow at open, right? Right??
I'm just doing this for adrenaline with 1 contract and its a wild ride lol. Let's hope I dont lose it all tomorrow before expiry! GME to 47+
I‚Äôm re-holding like the retard I am
Don‚Äôt worry. After Biden speech, we gonna hit +10% tomorrow. He gonna keep pumping the shit

Should that matter? All aspects shou be considered when assessing risk... You also only mentioned 1 metric to justify. Agai gold has been arou for thousands of years and there's a reason its price is where its at... Tesla has not been arou for thousands of  years... It's a relatively new company that is valued more than every single car company out together... Now how is that realistic when their p/e is 1500? Oh ya it isn't. Tesla stock is a needle In a hay stack. Telling someone to buy now Imo is massively risky...

All in all you are not understanding what im saying. As this guy wants to buy buy his first stock with his hard earned money you'd be a dick to tell him to buy tesla.

I don't care if your a bull or bear of tesla but it is overvalued and that is common knowledge.

That's the problem with these threads guys like you tell Joe blow trying to get into Investing and the stock market just a bit l, you tell em to buy stock A casue you got In super early and are up whatever 100% and no Joe blow is buyinf in at ATH and oh now 2 weeks later Joe blow is down 20%. And you feed off people like that, sickens me really

China‚Äôs  big state-owned firms are likely to face growing pressure to make  payments on their debt this year as Beijing moves to tighten credit  growth, government researchers and analysts said.

Last  year, Chinese state firms defaulted on 71.8 billion yuan (US$11.1  billion) worth of debt, accounting for 51 per cent of all defaults, and  the largest default total for state firms since China first allowed  onshore bond defaults in 2014, according to data from the National  Institution for Finance & Development (NIFD), a government-linked  think tank.

‚Äú\[The  data\] actually confirms our long-standing view that the \[challenges  facing the\] Chinese economy involve solving the problems of [state-owned enterprises](https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3096924/chinas-state-owned-giants-given-new-order-create-global)  to a considerable extent. \[This is the same situation\] in the real  economy and in the financial sector,‚Äù said Li Yang, chairman of the  NIFD, at a seminar on China‚Äôs bond market in Beijing on Tuesday.

In  fact, credit growth in China reached a peak in the last quarter of  2020, and it is now showing signs of slowing down. Overall, national  credit growth, based on total aggregate financing data ‚Äì which measures  fund flows from the financial sector to non-financial sectors in the  forms of loans, bonds and trust investment plans ‚Äì slowed for the second  straight month to 13.3 per cent year in December from a year earlier,  according to data released this week by China‚Äôs central bank.

‚ÄúWe  believe a managed tightening is in sight, as Chinese policymakers  carefully balance growth and risks. For now, policymakers are  maintaining a cautious, calibrated approach to policy easing, which is  reflected in tighter financial conditions at this stage of the recovery.  In the past, calibrating policies to balance growth and financial  stability have led to stop-go credit-driven business cycles in China,‚Äù  US rating agency Standard & Poor‚Äôs said in a note on Wednesday.

Liu  Jinsong, vice-president at ICBC Wealth Management, said overall debt  increased at most state companies last year as a result of credit  easing.

‚ÄúThere  is a trend of credit tightening, so we expect that the defaults of weak  state-owned enterprises and \[those\] at the bottom of the pile will be  highly contagious and will impact the entire credit market,‚Äù Liu said at  Tuesday‚Äôs bond market seminar.

In November, [Yongcheng Coal & Electricity Holding Group](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3110651/china-deepens-probes-roles-rating-agency-banks-and-brokers-after),  a mine operator in Henan owned by the provincial government, failed to  make principal and interest payments on a 1 billion yuan commercial  paper, despite its AAA rating, triggering a [wave of panic selling](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3110233/china-debt-defaults-stoke-unease-about-broader-market)in the bond market.

This  led to many state firms cancelling fundraising plans as a result of  weak investor confidence in their financial positions despite their  investment-grade ratings. Securities houses, accountants and rating  agencies involved are under investigation by Chinese regulators  regarding their role in the Yongcheng bond scandal.

Many bonds issued by Chinese companies, including state-owned firms, have been [rated as investment-grade](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3114069/china-debt-will-self-disclosed-scandal-bring-back-ratings) but the default rate of AA+ bonds was an astonishing 82 per cent last year, NIFD data showed.

‚ÄúAs  soon as the market went down, it was discovered that many AAAs and AAs  became just junk bonds,‚Äù the NIFD‚Äôs Li said. ‚ÄúI know that our relevant  departments have noticed this problem and are paying great attention to  it.‚Äù

Many  state-owned firms, despite being rated investment-grade, are weak due  to high leverage and poor profitability, analysts said. What‚Äôs more,  their financial positions are likely to get worse when Beijing gradually  begins withdrawing its credit market stimulus, potentially increasing  their borrowing costs.

To rescue its coronavirus-hit economy last year, China unleashed a [flurry of stimulus measures](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3083268/china-coronavirus-stimulus-what-measures-have-been-used),  including cutting taxes and increasing the issuance of special treasury  bonds to fund infrastructure investment by local governments, which  lifted the central government‚Äôs budget-deficit ratio to a record high of  3.6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). In addition, the People‚Äôs  Bank of China (PBOC) provided trillions of yuan in extra liquidity to  the market, driving down interest rates and borrowing costs.

‚ÄúA  good AA is much better than a bad AAA-rated bond, so you can‚Äôt just  look at the credit rating. It is necessary to avoid AAA-rated  state-owned enterprises with overcapacity and heavy historical burdens,‚Äù  Yun Zhanhua, vice-president of First Capital Securities, said at the  same seminar.

China‚Äôs  state firms have traditionally taken on important social  responsibilities, such as ensuring adequate employment. But despite  rounds of restructuring in the state sector, and efforts to open up the  Chinese economy, some sectors such as coal continue to suffer from  falling prices and bloated workforces. And transforming them to  commercially viable businesses has been slow.

‚ÄúFrom  a macroeconomic perspective, the overall leverage has to be  stabilised,‚Äù Yi was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúThe impact of the pandemic drove  down GDP growth, causing our leverage, and in turn our overall debt to  GDP, to rise significantly. The growth of leverage has already slowed  since the third quarter of 2020. \[We\] estimate it will return to a  basically stable direction.‚Äù

Chinese  regulators are increasingly concerned about the fallout from the  emergency economic measures introduced early this year, which caused the  nation‚Äôs debt-to-GDP ratio to rise to 266.4 per cent of GDP at the end  of the third quarter, up from 245.4 per cent at the end of the third  quarter in 2019, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  (CASS). The State Council-affiliated think tank expects China‚Äôs  debt-to-GDP ratio to hit 275 per cent for the whole of 2020.

Li,  who was a former vice-president at CASS, also warned that keeping  borrowing costs low for an extended period could worsen the  proliferation of Chinese [‚Äúzombie companies‚Äù](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2185186/china-steps-efforts-close-failed-zombie-companies-2020-faces),  which are long-term money-losing firms, often state-owned, and are  effectively insolvent but have been kept alive only by bank loans and  government subsidies.

‚ÄúGenerally  speaking, enterprises are beneficiaries because of the greater  availability of loans and improved financing costs \[from the economic  stimulus\]. However, we note that it is precisely because of such  availability and low cost that we end up with a big problem ‚Äì the  problem of zombie companies,‚Äù Li said.

‚ÄúThe  accumulation of these kinds of liabilities by state-owned enterprises  has been going for many years,‚Äù Yun said. ‚ÄúIt is difficult to change.  Once the capital funding chain is broken, it is very dangerous.‚Äù

PBOC  governor Yi Gang said in an interview with the state-run Xinhua News  Agency last week that monetary policy in 2021 should be stable, and that  liquidity should be kept reasonable and ample.

Yeah 42 here lol. Hope it goes up!
Think he made his first post on GME in September 2019. Over a full year ago he called this shit. He put serious money into it. About $100k all totaled. 

First few updates is nothing but people calling him a moron for ever buying Gamestop. Eventually after a few updates people start calling him a moron for not taking profits. Eventually, in the past couple of months, people have recognized Him as God taken the form of man to walk among us and given him the respect he fucking deserves. 

It's an absolutely incredible story and bet. He turned 100k into a fucking retirement. He can seriously actually just retire right now and live a great life. He can't buy 10 boats but he never really has to worry about money again.
I'm not sure if you are joking or not, so if this is a joke I'm sorry. Anyway:

Yes. Gamestop was founded in 1986 so it's their 35th birthday this year. They have faced alot of challenges this year, but overcame every single one of them. Just like Joe did himself. 

***"We will not go quietly into the night!***

***We will not vanish without a fight!***

Hi OP, it‚Äôs encouraging to know that even if you start out having a really hard time, you can see results if you keep trying! I‚Äôm just starting out myself, just waiting for some funds to transfer into my app, you probably have already answered this but there‚Äôs lots of comments, do you have any advice for what you think is most important not to do as a beginner?
Interesting. So then what do you come to the sub for?
Holly fuck this is so fucking stupid I cant stop laughing lmao
F will print.
Nice buying at the top
cannot go tits up
Yeah what's with that ?

Need more detail.

What kind of debt at what interest rate?

Where would you invest?

How much of an emergency fund do you have?

If you don't have at least 1 month of expenses saved (preferably 3+), save it.  If you have savings and it's high interest debt, pay it.  If it's low interest debt and you have savings, invest it.
Seems like when conservatives accuse the left of something, it‚Äôs an admission of their own guilt. 

All of the nonsense about George Soros paying BLM protesters or Sandy Hook being paid actors, every homophobic anti-gay marriage senator secretly banging the pool boy etc etc.
Think it‚Äôs a long term hold
MicroStrategy is a great company have used them for work at my previous job and my boss was blown away by their upcoming updates. We were going to transition to tableau but now pushing to stay with MicroStrategy

Yep, you should watch his most recent livestream. Super wholesome guy just thanking everyone that's been with him for the ride.
I‚Äôve been diamond handing share of XPEV but was thinking about buying some calls. Would be curious to see your target. BB is printing me some damn money today. Thank you.
Someone tell me I‚Äôm good for holding ICLN long term cos I‚Äôm paper handed asf

Someone please explain how that could even be possible
That doesn‚Äôt help WSB we all play weeklies here
Fuck off Melvin
why the hell didnt you tell the rest of us?!
BTW: Although it was earlier this week that somebody asked, apparently as yields go up, dividend stocks can struggle. 

That might have been the reason for the utility sector to have some trouble and might have been the reason that it did better yesterday when we saw yields run into some trouble.

that yahoo guy is a douche. he thinks we're penny stock pumpers.  just because we have 1.8m users doesn't mean they're all buying GME
nice
You know where you are right?
Nope.  All I did was DD on Ameca (STHC) that I shared, albeit unorthodoxly at first.  I do not own OPTI and never will.  I do not like the company.  We are not a pump group.

How much did he actually invest initially?
I think everyone here knows that institutional short sellers are the worst type of scum.  We all see the ways that they operate.  Market manipulation is the whole basis of what they do.  So it is real nice to them getting what they deserve from retail YOLO traders.  We really busted off one in their fucking ass today.  Fuck them.
Bought 50 15c 2/5 for BB before close these bouta print
I think it was implied, but I'm retarded so not sure.
Loss/gain porn.
If you don‚Äôt buy your gf WOOF than her bf will...
I think your best bet would to be to take a look at several different stocks to get an idea of they‚Äôre option contracts at different prices, write them down, and check back in a week to see how they‚Äôve changed. Sometimes options are dirt cheap, and sometimes they‚Äôre super expensive, I‚Äôm sure the reasons I‚Äôve listed above are big factors, but I have no clue what else makes them tick.
That's deep

You good bro
Thinking a lot about Gamestop today. 

You had be retarded to make that play.

You had to also be retarded to not make the play.

Conclusion; WSB is peak retardation.
Not at all... I kinda regret not taking it all out sometimes but hey if I can play a long game than I have no worries I do want to try that with another position double and than take out and do that a few times and than do a spilt
Fuck this bullshit market, gay as fake economy losing copious money every day I quit!

MSFT safest play in tech change my mind.
It's ungodly stable.
100 fool
So you're discrediting good technicals because stock values are based on memes as an argument that it's going to dump.

Have you noticed how every other company in e-commerce has mooned this year?

You're grasping at straws to shit on people that made money when you didn't believe in the play. Congratulate people that hit big and move on dude. It's crazy how many people on this sub **hate** when other people make money.
not sure why but i bought GME calls expiring tomorrow and went from 0% - 200% -0% within 20 minutes.
Is that legal?
Can someone explain this to me?  Im just starting to figure out how these calls work.  Why $2m to exercise?  And say if he had $2m to exercise them, would he have made much more money that way...how does that work?
Balls of steel, holding 5 million dollars.

Unfortunately, when I did it although immediately it went my direction, I got whipsawed REAL quick and took a pretty brutal stop out..
The problem is whether the price worths the squeeze

GME gonna open at $45 tomorrow
BB calls?
GME close to going positive in AH
They won't regulate. They'll just make it go to zero.
 
^^Where ^^are ^^my ^^FedCoins^TM ^^??
Dude, look at TSLA. Valuations dont matter, that is no reason
Check the faq in r/options \- lots of basic stuff there. Also you can learn more at the OCC/CBOE education site - [https://www.optionseducation.org/optionsoverview/](https://www.optionseducation.org/optionsoverview/) 

But yes - if you are buying an option - the most you can lose is the cost of the option.
Just put a sell order at 60 or something.
If you‚Äôre not borrowing from family and friends, are you even into stocks?
good luck ü•¥
Okay you loony toons. BUY at open tomorrow. 

Man I love you guys.
Honestly, nice fuckin work, man.
technically a 1.58 M gain.  The gain from his 1/15 calls aren't shown
Buy or die
my 1 contract for GME 23c 1/15 cost me $24 and I sold it for $1,500.  Then I bought more with that and it turned to shit :(

Can only rely on a moon landing for tomorrow.  Otherwise, I'm in deep space without a suit.
GME just needs to split :) need more shares!
Look up BlackBerry QNX. That‚Äôs all you need to know.

Partnerships with BIDU, NVDA (NIO), AMZN, etc.
Well I bought at 20 at $425, so you have better odds than me.
Best suggestion is to have an exit plan. Sell XX% shares at XX% gains. For instance you have 100 shares, set an exit price for 20 of them, than a higher exit price for 40, than an unreasonably high price for 20 and an unspeakable price for the reaming 20... Values depend on your risk tolerance... Stick to the plan! Good luck man! See you on the battlefield tomorrow!
You are good. Trust the Joe to go balls deep in saving the planet.

However I went into SPY right afterwards when it was going ape shit and recovered

I congratulate you, my friend! I honestly cannot brag about my gainz. I'm diversified and slow.

It only matters that it's a big deal to you, how you feel about it, and not what others think. The fact that you decided to post about it tells me you're very happy about it and that's a nice thought.
YO MY CALLS UP 115% ALREADY WE TAKING THE GAINS OR SELLING BOYS?
Never thought I'd say this but I should've bought *way* more calls on APHA back in September.
touche lol
Fuck man PLUG looking for another ass day tm
How does this sub feel about options? If everyone likes pennys here. If your sure enough of a catalyst to buy a ton of stocks why not buy a call for a fraction of the price and then sell? I did this with CRON the other day turned $40 to $155 in just 2 days with 5 contracts because of all the talk of weed stocks going up. I couldn‚Äôt have afforded 500 shares. Not sure if this is a smart play and I barley understand option trading at all so any tips would be appreciated. 

It seems like buying just slightly OTM brings you just as good a return as loading up on a ton of stock, then I suppose if it really rockets you could buy it at a still fairly low price when the contract is up? Maybe I‚Äôm missing something.
Damn, I love your thesis.
I‚Äôm in

Serious question. Do you guys care if GME survives/thrives as a company, or is your primary concern making righteous tendies off of the short squeeze/faith in Cohen/whatever else it takes to make tendies?

tl;dr: Do you care more about GME as a company, or just making tendies?

Yes brother
Can always just buy back at a higher strike price, right? Bought some wfc today. Im too easily manipulated by this sub.
It seems like it‚Äôs not possible after some research, best way looks to be having a separate software for charting and using them in conjunction.

I‚Äôve been using the zeroweb, and yeah it‚Äôs not the best, i think i‚Äôm just going to switch to zeropro as i‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs considerably better.

As for my experience with Tradezero i‚Äôve only been paper trading thus far, so can‚Äôt say much about execution or live trading. The customer service is great though.

You sell the contract on the market to someone else.  That other person then exercises the options.  It's no longer you're issue to deal with.  Typically its a larger firm that's exercising the option to buy the stock.  But that's between them.

Hey this guy got it wrong. Switching mining coins is not that simple. ASIC miners are used to mine BTC on the SHA256 algo, they are designed for this algorithm. They can only mine this algorithm effectively. They can not mine Ethash or any other algorithm effectively. So no they can't just swap what to mine. 

They are absolutely going to lose value if BTC loses value. They are mooning on the speculation that BTC goes up even more.

Well I‚Äôve had calls for 2 weeks I was hoping for a run up so maybe next week or maybe it responds good to Biden tonight. Fuck break $131 and stay there.
the problem with PLTR is that it's not really a story stock and even if it is it's not a story that people like... basically big brother surveilance state shit.

it's also a product with very few clients so people don't see it in use in their everyday life.

they need some BIG partnerships or BIG contracts (not this 5 million dollar shit, this is supposed to be a 50 billion dollar company) or it's just going to continue bleeding out.

I'm pretty skeptical. Even the best-case latency from the speed of light isn't great for many types of games across long distances. There would have to be huge data centers spread out geographically.

The vaccine is now in the process of evolving from speculation to reality. When stocks are speculative, the price can move all over the place. When news comes through, now it's a matter of understanding what the revenue picture is going to look like going forward and knowing how much of it is already priced in. In order to assess that and watch it play out, it requires patience and a lot of homework. Rather than do that, a lot of investors took their profits and went on to the next shiny thing. If you believe that there are longer-term profits off the vaccine and the coming 3 or 30 months aren't effectively pricing that in, then keep your shares and enjoy the ride. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr version - buy the rumor sell the news.

I don't believe TSP offers any sort of in-service withdrawals for Roth contributions. It didn't sound like that was a concern in the original hypothetical, given the Age 57 pension. Having the fully tax-free growth would be awfully appealing and offer some spending flexibility beyond Age 59.5 (e.g. buy a new car in cash or take a once-in-a-lifetime vacation all without any impact on your taxes).

You shouldn't feel like a dick. OP could've bought almost any stock in the entire world in any time march and after and made buckets of money.
Was granted 38k options at my company (very popular and well known tech health startup) with $3.50 grant price. Only half vested and will take 2 more years to fully vest. We‚Äôre prepping for IPO this year. Pretty damn bullish on this company, but have an itch to leave. Should I stick it out and get all 38k options? Never been part of an IPO before so not sure if these would turn into millions or not. What y‚Äôall do?
Yeah it went stupid after earnings and even if it does dip down ima hold that‚Äôs just gonna mean the hulk dick that‚Äôs gonna be on our screens is gonna be bigger with everyone buying the dip
It's holding it's value impressively steady at $38-40. This has so much room to run.

99% of people are better off buying and holding long term investing. But if you want to learn to daytrade why not? At least you made some money and the knowledge you've picked up is invaluable.

Kinda weird PLTR keeps trending down, despite contract announcements. Gotta feeling PLTR going to explode after lockup, not dip.

This also seems relatively safe? Since the strike price is close and the expiration date is March, it gives you an opportunity to get to $12-15 or more for instance?

This is not true. For search and social, yes, but banners, retargeting, preroll, audio, and CTV are largely ran through DSPs like TheTradeDesk, Amazon DSP, and hundreds of other smaller players. As CTV continues to take over for traditional TV, these companies will continue to grow.

Google has exposure to programmatic, but Facebook is fairly limited to ads on their platform. They have an audience network, but it's going to be worthless with iOS 14 and the elimination of 3rd party cookies. So, FB's revenue will need to come from an increasing user base (tough to do now that they can't buy competitors) or additional products outside of FB/IG/WhatsApp.

This.  So This.
I guess the math can favor the options selling within a certain risk margin. 

"The option *has* to go up by X more before executing is worth more than the premium now, but if I wait and sell the option later after the stock plateaus, the premiums I'll get will be lower."

This is territory where I can understand the principal a lot faster than I can just do the math in my head. I'm guessing there are calculators or sites people use for this.
Realistically, if it's ever going to hit the 1.5-2 range, there would need to be good news regarding their pipeline trial results. Other than that, I doubt it'll sky rocket. They're expecting important trial results within Q1, so it may be another month or two.
GME pinned just below 40, one day before puts expire worthless, tomorrow is gonna be lit
uhm no. Person is pretty clearly putting themselves out there for what they did. People are giving them a realistic outlook on their outcome. Better to set the person‚Äôs expectations than everyone to pat them on the back like they did something special

I believe in GME in long run, they will change their business plan and it'll generate money. It will take some time however. PLTR i'm not really a fan of.

But BB ow baby, these boys already changed their course. They own the EV market, they own the cybersecurity market and they cash in from their old market (smartphones) by selling patents. In a couple of days/week when I'll divert the GME gainz to BB, which will then take me to MARS  üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Ford has made a quite a pretty penny these past couple days. I got 2600 shares at 8.50.

Ima open a BB position tomm for the first time cuz i only saw it today.  Starting, itll be ~500 to 1k in leaps and 1-2k in stocks.  

But im SUPER bullish on Ford.  Literally 100% of my portfolio is ford right now lol

> stock values are based on memes as an argument that it's going to dump.

GME is *absolutely* a stock value based on memes. Like even the people pumping it know that. This company was literally on the verge of death before WSB decided to induce a short squeeze last year. 

> You're grasping at straws to shit on people that made money when you didn't believe in the play. Congratulate people that hit big and move on dude. It's crazy how many people on this sub hate when other people make money.

I already did. And just because I have a different opinion than yours and the hivemind's doesn't make me bitter or a hater lol. I've struck gold on plenty of meme tickers from this community and I love it for that. But like, you shouldn't be putting Gamestop on a pedestal. Just fuck her and leave.

Well if I sell them tomorrow it won‚Äôt be a day trade anymore and I think I‚Äôll be fine then? I guess part of me was also confused about if my contract would sell today or tomorrow.. so I guess I can sell tomorrow at open and be okay? I bought them today.. which is why I‚Äôm so confused right now. And I have 1 ‚Äúlocked‚Äù PDT on robinhood. So 3/4 pdt already.

I decided to get 100 shares the other day. I think there is definitely risk here and I'd hate to be catching a falling knife but I just cannot see how the news made it wipe 3 bill off the value. The medicine that they had the mixed results with the study is not worth 50% of their value they have 40 drugs in the pipeline and are one of the only ones working on DMD that already have drugs on the market. I think this is a risky play because of how easily a single downgrade made it drop and the volumes are low so ot can be pretty volatile but I decided to go for it after doing some research and ill see how it plays out. 

Ark did double down on their investment but I think what you need to consider there too is for them they are basically averaging down their buy in price because they already had a good amount of shares. However they have bought several days in a row now and I think this should be over 120 but I do think you might be waiting a while for the gain. The full details of the report won't even be available till later in the year. I just dont think  the entire companies value lies in the results of a single product.

this guy r/wallstreetbets and is on a rocket to tendie town on the moon!  (this sub is basically gambling advise! be careful... but the Memes are HQ and funny!)

but really...  if you just pay attention to the world there is a natural ebb and flow to things.  MJ is big topic and it is on the rise, and will stay that way for the next year or two. if some stuff gets delayed by gov. then it might drop again ... but that is when you "Buy the dip" in the price... double down, the long play will make more safely then trying to time it just right to "get rich quick"...  in the end it is all based on revenue and weed ... well sells itself.  

between tax incentives for states to fund programs, federal looking to pay for out national debt and compaines who just want $$...  there is never a shortage of people who want to use it. (hence the decades long black and gray markets for it)  

when that become no differnt that cigs, or beer... there will be a new "must have" thing in town...  clean energy? recycling? anything to stop global warming? etc...  just pay attenion and find the index / etf that tracks that thing.  buy and HOLD.  it'll make you money over time.  

I knew MJ would blow up 8 years ago when i saw gov. officials who left federal office and join the Board of Directors of a few of these companies (including officials who publicly opposed it's legalization!). They had no real sales yet, but millionaires with political power and connections were now invested and putting their power behind it, quietly.  This is how they secure generational wealth and power.    

***(I am not a financial advisor nor is any of this advice that should be taken without your own due diligence.  Never invest what you cant afford to lose.)***

Positions I hold or have held:  $MJ $MSOS $THCX $YOLO $POTX $TOKE $ACB $SNDL $CGC $APHA $GRWG $TLRY $CRON  $HEXO

good Luck and be safe!

What are you talking about?  If you look up Blackberry news there's several articles about selling dozens of patens to Huawei this morning.

Nope - BB is still super cheap, get in there!
Forgive me, retard here, what exactly has changed since their earnings call last month?
Damn GME, you are giving me the good kind of paper hands! Sold 100 shares at 35 yesterday, 100 at 40 today and now i want to ride the remaining 200  into the $50-60 range! So good when paper handing means just a loss of potential profit

No, they are not a spac, and new company? Not so much, they're 6 years old (young af but not new) and they've been trading on the NSYE since October 2020.

They 100% reverse merged into facebank March 19, 2020.

There's a distinct difference between a reverse merger and a SPAC business combo.

Smooth Brain, standing by.
Do we have any reliable live/daily data on current short interest for GME (outside of iBorrow)?
I'm not sure but they better hope that there aren't a bunch more shorts looking to unwind tomorrow. It's gonna be an interesting day followed by whatever happens on monday
stick it out and collect the free money.
I'm rooting for you guys but the whole reason GME is where it is is because of a *lack* of innovation lol

SPCE after hours:

‚ÄúARGHH, CALL AN AMBULANCE!

How do you guys diamond hands to capture the full profit of a good call that you made? literally sell too early every time. Been stuck at the same portfolio for like a month now. or am i too well hedged.
Down almost full percent AH
Yes, but I'm not a retiree. Retirees can cover their families with tri-care, which isn't free. That is different than what I have through the VA
Wait till tomorrow-Tuesday
They are also an investor and supplier for Lordstown (former plant which I'm sure you already knew) which is a solid EV play.
Tbh I still love walking into a GameStop and picking up cheap ass games and get nostalgia feelings. So if daddy cohen can revamp them, that would be sick.
Better opportunities elsewhere. Leave SNAP in the dust.
You are literally just trading too much and selling when you're scared and being a wuss. Set it and forget it if its a good stock, and if its a total meme like SPCE you could be up 100% right now.
Who will beat them though? Dis is the only competitor so far.

I do think things are overvalued, but I‚Äôm also not sure that things are going to drop, at least in the short term. Lots of variables I believe coming into play. We have more stimulus that looks to be coming, Democrats printing more money, raising minimum wage, spending, which in theory hurts the value of the dollar and increase stock prices.  On the other hand you have potential for tax increases which would hurt the market. 

With that being said, my prediction is stock prices continue to rise in the short term while these spending plans are rolled out and more stimulus is sent as the dollar continues to decrease.  Then as life starts to really get back to normal probably next year, interest rates start to rise and tax increase plans are rolled out, the market will begin to drop.

Obviously you can‚Äôt predict or time the market and this could be completely wrong, but this is the thesis I have been using.

problem is their calls arent very liquid so they are very expensive, same as TRUP. TRUP great stock, shit shit shit shit shit options. 125C septs are 20$.... like tf

They're not worthless yet. The MARA call is worth around $0.42/share ($42 total). If MARA opens higher tomorrow, you should be able to sell for some money (may be a profit depending on how high it gaps up).

And the RLTY put is worth around $0.23/ share ($23 total). Again, you might sell for some money or profit if TLRY gaps down.

&#x200B;

My advice is to close both on market open tomorrow. Wait for 5-10 minutes after market open for the bids/asks to come in and sell for whatever you can get for both.

You didn't want either, or you don't understand what they are, get rid of them.

There is no reason to freak out, the worst that can happen is they drop to zero so you lose what you paid for them.
Your first mistake was relying on YouTube. There is so much garbage and marketing nonsense that it's almost impossible to find genuine content on the platform.

Hang in there! Use this time to reevaluate your positions. Only invest in what you believe in and stick to it. There are good days and bad days. Today was a bad one for you. Were stronger together! Best of luck.
I am also retarded. Bought FDs 55c right before close. But they were so cheap! 100 55c 1/15 .6 money is fake and only good for gambling.

Sounds dead to me.
You are completely right that Google seems to have the problem of too many chefs in the kitchen but look at the project as an individual project and what its trying to do and not a forecast of things to come and you will see the potential in it. Yes there are massive hurdles to overcome but I wouldnt bet against big tech to overcome those, especially not Google. They will most definitely atleast try to overcome those hurdles, might be impossible but in this age? Many things today would seem like breaking the laws of physics to even Einstein
I don't follow this sub much. So can someone explain to me what's happening? Everyone buying GME? Would it be a bad idea to buy some tmm morning?
They announced a new EV

My sources have told me GameStop inc. is done and not just on twitch.
Why should you max Roth IRA in index funds if those are the ones you probably won‚Äôt be selling in long term. Shouldn‚Äôt you put the short term individual stocks in Roth IRA?
I have to admit I don't think it's a good thing when stocks just start flying and nobody can figure out what makes the company good.
or expire worthless :(

Please don't expire worthless
Dude I'm bearish on this euphoric market but the snap thing is retarded. How you going to dump on banning trump from the social media platform he is probably least relevant on.
Literally one google search would tell you. This is leveraged bit c oin, which you can‚Äôt find anywhere else. The c oin is poised to have a massive year and this is a way you can get a leveraged position for that. There isn‚Äôt an ETF and there aren‚Äôt futures trading, you can‚Äôt buy options for it on exchanges. This is a loophole in the financial system.
I think everyone on this sub is onboard with that

Its not... a concern necessarily.  But I'd like to be aware of the options.  If I wanted to buy that new car in cash at 51, it would be a lot easier if that money was in a taxable account, for example.  Or paying for college.  Or whatever.

I have no clue on how to even go about calculating how much GME stock is owned in this sub. I commend you for trying!

This was a price rise on fundamentals, not a fully  fledged short squeeze! Hopefully some better dd will confirm that. Gme was trading 0.2 x earnings but showed really good ecommerce revenue growth +303%. Thats exactly what they need to do to transition into the next phase of the company. All these boomers shouting short squeeze cant even see true value when its in front of their face. Fuck its a value play even at 40 its at 0.4x earnings??
500.25 he bought a fractional initially
I know it‚Äôs gonna get some hate but I‚Äôm gills deep in cciv. Waiting for the big pop. Could be a pump and dump but the risk is worth the potential

Fuck it, I‚Äôm in.
I mean that‚Äôs kind of what we‚Äôve been doing all morning
If it does, it will be because of the short squeeze and not because the longs. My prediction is that if it goes to +20% tomorrow it will go to +100% tomorrow and if it goes to -15% tomorrow it will go to -50% tomorrow.
Also going to take a phone call mid conference on his blackberry
GME is the worst example of a bubble I've ever seen. But Tesla and SPCE yeah that shit is retarded.
Listen, I have been holding 15-16k shares and calls since it was at $13, bought more @ $20 and again another 500 shares @ $38. You‚Äôre not in a bad spot. There was consolidation like on Tuesday at $20.

Tomorrow we get another big green dildo

and on top of all that, housing is a built in cost for living that you must pay.  you can pay it into a rental, or into an owned residence.  each has its advantages.  but for me, mortgage is several hundred less a month than an identical rental, and maintenance hasn't nearly been enough to cancel out the difference.

I‚Äôve gone through those stretches, it will turn around. I do better holding cash instead of buying and holding hedges (aka puts), you‚Äôre just going to bleed out on either end.

As for profits, set a target you are comfortable with and stick with it. You‚Äôll be more profitable in the long run.

This is all conspiratorial garbage, dude.   You don't know what you're talking about at all.

Do you actually have some kind of delusional disorder?    Actual banks, investment firms, and reputable companies would not work with crypto exchanges if this were true.   You are implying that hundreds of firms with tens of thousands of employees are in on a scam.

I‚Äôm exercising while In positions. 
This keeps me from exiting as soon as I‚Äôm in loss or profit. 

My entries are often high risk and that‚Äôs why I like small accounts. I have to sent mental sl and get out when criteria is met. If I watch I will be in constant anxiety. As well as add more positions with the market. I have learned that stacking messes me up more times then not since retracemnts cause me to be over leverge.

But your question makes me think that I can add some Variations  if the losses stack up so that it doesn‚Äôt get boring. But the rule is it has to be a lot. 

So if it was jumping jacks it would be 300 or jogging in place for 20-30 minutes 

No simple shit so you can‚Äôt rush the process. It‚Äôs suppose to kick your ass.

I view Apple as the least at risk for taxes and anti-trust lawsuits; Amazon and Microsoft would get hit first mainly for their web hosting and using those profits elsewhere.

No because at this point their exposure is short on a net positive delta stack of options so they need to be long not short.
Anything can really happen tomorrow depending on what Biden says for tonight. If his stimulus is higher vs expectations all the small cap and covid hit stocks should continue to fly. If it‚Äôs not then expect tech to rebound tomorrow. Just my take. I do think Tesla is not going to break 900$ for at least a bit since the stock needs to take a breather like it did in the 400s

It's a continuous contract graph. The current price is from the active contract (/ESH1) and the past prices are previously active contracts stitched on to the current one.

if it expires out of the money, as in ICLN is 35.02 or higher your contract is worthless and worth 0. If it is 35.01 or lower your broker may auto-exercise the contracts for you, give you 100 shares and subtract 3500 from your balance. This week looks like they'll be worthless though, but ya never know!

Hey Joe what do you think of TDOC?  I'm jacked to the tits on shares and ARKG calls.  Love the show.
it's a call, not a put.

you're buying a contract to purchase 100 shares of $BB for $14/share on or before 2/19. So if it goes over $14, you make money. Let's say it's $15, you exercise the option and buy those 100 shares for $14, so you're automatically up $100.

What happens more often though is that people buy and sell just the contracts without necessarily exercising them. So like I buy a contract for 1/15 9c and I pay $0.27/share ($27 total price for the contract), then the stock goes up and suddenly the ability to buy shares at $9/ea becomes more desirable so the price goes up and now that same contract is worth $0.54/share, or $54. 

so to somebody who has the capital to exercise it, they see that the stock price is currently $9.60/share, which would be $960/100 shares, or they can buy my contract for $54 and buy 100 shares for $9 per the contract = total price for them comes to $954.

I do this everytime before,once I have and after I buy/sell. Hahahahahahaü§ë
Fuck it. I'm in.
I'm pretty sure you don't have to multiply it by laverage. You can use a app like Stinu, which you just input your account size and risk, how many pips does your SL have and it gives you the lots. Me personally, I calculate the 1% of my account, like you did, 1000$ account, 1% = 10$, then I Divide the 1% by the amount of pips in my stop loss. If I have 10 pip stop loss, 10/10 = 1$ per pip and I use a site xm pip value calculator to find out the lot size. 

There might be an easier way to do this, this is just my way of doing it. Let me know, if I was any help!
Thanks man, banking on Buyden
If you are going to buy in 5 years anyway and you can afford to now, I'd say to just do it now.
Lmao wtf. Okay

I bought September calls for what feels like nothing today.

We have nine months to see if that was a trap or not.

Hey OP where can I learn about things of this nature?
Funny i was just reading about this yesterday
We‚Äôll see.

With the huge bump this week and an increase in short volume during it. Tons of short positions are going to be forced to close. Hence the short squeeze. That‚Äôs how.
Yes, and since going public they have beat earning expectations on all their fiscal reports. But I have no clue why they‚Äôre selling
If all goes well I'll likely take at least a full year or two after retiring to slow travel (all of my travels my entire life have felt so rushed, so I want to have nearly zero day to day schedule, just go with the flow).

Then I'd like to work part time at a few jobs for just long enough that I learn enough to feel confident, such as: barista, bike mechanic, nursery/farmer, etc. 
I want to build the skills/knowledge for making great coffee, fixing my own bikes, growing a massive food garden, etc. 
Then give back all of any earnings from each job to the people who taught me those skills as a thank you gift. 

Good thing about each of those things is that they can be found in nearly every large city. So while I'm traveling all over, if I come across a really cool business/person that was hiring, I would just rent a small place nearby and learn the trade from them. Then carry on down the road. 

But once I'm ready to "settle down" I don't think I'll ever work a 'real job' ever again. I'll volunteer and do what I can to help my community, but don't want the stress of even a part time job. I wanna clean plate where only I dictate what I do each day.

Is it too late for the BB ship?
only real concern is the currency conversion you will have to do,
once when funding and when taking out your gains.

and dont forget to negotiate for lower commissions with your broker once in a while,
do a few hundred trades, ask for better prices. they run a risk free business, you don't.
Said f it and bought 100 BB‚Äôs AH. 2/5 $15 calls mid day and 2/19 $10 calls this morning. Shits gonna moon tomorrow.

Came to say the same! Thank you Justin!
I‚Äôm not too worried since I plan on holding. It popped on the Disney+ news and has cooled off - I think it‚Äôs going to be in a good place to load more. Those shows are still coming and even more are in the pipeline. Disney+ will continue to grow and the amount of content they are producing for known IP‚Äôs will make them a leader of the streaming wars for years to come. 

Remember there is still big recovery stock potential as well once the parks/cruises open fully. That and they‚Äôve made the decision to hold big release (marvel) movies to try and cash in at the box office once people feel more comfortable. If they continue the success with marvel phase 4 and get the Star Wars hype back - üöÄ
Very nice, thanks for building and sharing.

Thoughts & Suggestions:

1 - On straight vanilla spreads, when you enter the amount of contracts for leg #1, the 2nd leg would mirror the same # of contracts  (as usually those # of contracts are the same).  If they're different, you could still have the program make them the same but the user would just have to go in and edit the 2nd position (if that makes sense).

2-  The little "low open interest" is a cool feature..... but it doesn't show the actual OI.  Maybe you could add OI to the little dropdown box (where you input price) so we could see it along with the greeks?

3-  When adding calls or puts to an existing strategy with non-current contract prices, the contract prices revert back to the current option price.  Ex: I entered a call spread that I have.  I bought it a while ago, so my costs are different than the current market.  I then added another separate call, with a different expiration, and the original spread values have reverted back to current prices.  Similarly, even changing the strikes along the sliding scale will revert the costs back to current.   **edit:  ok after more play time on the site, this one is really quite bothersome.  If you don't change anything else, I'd strongly emphasize changing this.**  Maybe add a button inside the dropdown that allows the user to 'freeze' the price... that way you could turn on/off depending on whether you already have an existing position or you're looking at establishing a new position (and you'd want current prices).

4-  Allow for multiple expirations, not just front month and back month.  I'd suggest getting rid of that terminology altogether and simply just list the expiry months.  Some of my initial positions end up being multiple leg strategies with multiple expirations, and/or I often wonder how adding a position here & there would affect a starting position...... it would be cool to be able see them all together (like optionsprofitcalculator does, but theirs is pretty clunky as you have to pre-select the # of legs).

5-  When combining both front-month and back-month strategies together, the table/graph is only showing as far as the front-month expiry.  Obviously that's a problem when I can't see the entire strategy.  (maybe user error?)

6-  Allow the chart range to be set by the user (allows for un-equal range around multiple leg strategies).  I like the slider function, it's quick and easy, but I also like optionsprofitcalculator how you can select it manually.

&#x200B;

Fixing up some of these little things would go a long way IMHO.  Thanks for all your hard work in putting it together.  Cheers

Bohooo
May I interest you with some SRPT? Mama Cathie has been holding 5x as much as she used to, and she keeps adding. Right now it's 0.8% of ARKG. It's a gene-editing play that is really undervalued, and no stock crashes 50% without at least a little rebound, so its easy buy.

I personally picked up LMT but both should do relatively well.
Its push back up, green af by pm tomorrow
Very interesting, you use them as a broker if you get an acount and they have those spreads on most pairs?

Barely any theta tbh. Even with the 30C‚Äôs. When the price moves up fast the premium is <$0.10. Exercising is fine in this case.
I worked as a Manager in an coworking space/office rental space. I literally got paid to party with really cool people and help them with their company. Worked for a large corporation so pay was actually really good. Downside was I was the manager so had to collect rent, kick out, and politely discipline members. I was always on the clock too. Terrible for my social life and marriage.

I would really like to do that as an hourly employee (not manager), working part time. That would be my ideal post fire chill job. 

Also, at the building I worked at we had a building staff member who was the best, most on-it, yet good natured friendly guy I‚Äôve ever worked with. You always knew you could count on him and customers loved him too. He was retired and only did the job so he didn‚Äôt spend all day watching TV.

It really is amazing how having f you money makes you an even better team member. I feel it in myself too.

If there will be de-hedhing causing volatility and possible sell-offs/drops what time would you expect that to happen? Very close to end of day tomorrow (as I assume that calls want to be kept hedged while people still can exercise all day tomorrow)?

You hold it until it sells or itll expire in the money. Youll get the sifferneve between the strike price and the stock price.

At my first job interview after graduating from a top-20 school, I sat on a dirty couch (don't ask why there was a couch in the office) and listened to an old man tell me women were terrible with numbers and he hoped he wasn't making a mistake hiring me for a bank consulting position. People like him make women scared of money. I went on to get an MBA, worked in IT at two different banks, saved my money, bought some houses, and now get to stay at home reading reddit all day and trading stonks with my daughter.

It is 100% because of WSB I even thought about buying BB or GME. Both off DDs. For BB I have 7.5c 1/21/22 because I thought this was got to be a much longer play.
Got fucked in the ass by Tesla back in September, lost 78% of my account, finally got back to even and far into the green and told myself I would let my account be more than 15% options 

Currently have 80% of my account in options and feeling like a true bulltard

I saw a really convincing post about how GME only trade(at 20) at 1X it‚Äôs revenue, whereas most companies trade at multiples. With Cohen‚Äôs leadership this could be some deep fucking value.

Not much, but I'm tired of watching the train leave me.
Hoooooooy fuck BB
I‚Äôd say prob SQ just because I think they jumped on it earlier, I‚Äôm pretty sure a while ago they bought like $50M in Bitcoin but I‚Äôm not sure what percentage of that was for facilitating their crypto business with customers and what percentage was just a hold as an asset.  PYPL going heavy into it also, can‚Äôt remember if it was from the last earnings call or an interview I saw with the CEO but it seems like the main benefits for PayPal from the crypto stuff isn‚Äôt really from selling crypto and making a markup on it, it‚Äôs more like people who use crypto on our platform start using our platform a lot more for other stuff and we make money off that. Sort of like how prime users buy more stuff on Amazon. I would imagine this is probably the case for Square also but PayPal is in with the CCP in China (first foreign firm with full ownership of their payments business in China) so that usually results in good things for investors. I have more PYPL than SQ personally but that‚Äôs just because I got in earlier than SQ.

My opinion on Facebook is mixed. I actually just sold my shares after a little over five years to put into other stuff this morning. Good company it seems and it seems like it is the backbone of the Internet, I like what you‚Äôre doing with VR / virtual stores and everything but I was just more interested in other stuff. FB is cash machine though, and Zuck has it humming nicely for now :) 

That‚Äôs fair, everyone has their own strategy that works for them and you should for sure stay mostly inside your comfort zone :)

You have to be brain-dead to buy tlry over apha right now. Compared to merge pricing, apha is at a discount. And if the merge falls through? Apha is the far more valuable of the two anyways.

They closed all the locations when pandemic started, for about 3 months. Then they opened with reduced capacity in states that allowed it. In some states, with renewed cases, they were closed again. They still are closed in Oregon and California. They had to reduce number of bay that can be open, additional expenses of cleaning/sanitizing/installing physical barriers between bays etc. For evidence, just google, their website will tell you Sacramento and Hillsboro are still closed. I think all UK locations are still closed. My source: few friends are/were managers at top golf

Gme calls tomorrow?
Although this would still be to our benefit as holders, they'd just ride with us the squeeze to hedge or potentially even profit. There was some high volume of ridiculous of another 40k 55C for tomorrow (lmao) at less than a dollar today. Say they cover first, price goes up, and then their calls also moon? Not sure of the math tho, I'm assuming covering the short position either way is super expensive tho. Either way I think everyone that's in wins, until the stock eventually corrects.

They're not the same. I feel like XAUUSD has less chop and more defined movements. If it's going to go down it will go down for a few candles. If it will go up it will go up a few candles. GBPUSD feels like it has quite a bit of chop even during trends that can make me drop out of trades earlier than I'd like. In that regard, I prefer XAUUSD. However, spreads on GBPUSD are so low I have confidence to put stop trades when I'm confident what direction the candles will go and I can be in and out of a trade in seconds for a few pip profit. It can be harder to that on XAUUSD since you have to make up for the spread first.

>	The real risk for all of us is a prolonged drawdown period, where instead of volatile swings down and back up, we just slowly bleed down over a multi-year time frame, and then slowly climb back up over the next few years. Again, this hasn‚Äôt happened since 2000, but I wouldn‚Äôt rule it out as an impossibility (though I doubt that it will happen this year since we‚Äôre in a zero percent interest rate environment for the near-term).

Yep.  Lots of dumb confidence due to the extraordinary rebound we‚Äôve had.

The 2001-2005 stretch was awful. Everyone and their grandmother hated equities and it took almost 7 years for the S&P500 to reach its peak again, only to go into the great financial crash-drawdown a few months later.


This whole decade has been something else for equities.

I keep seeing some health (and others) stocks going up and up an incredible percentage each day. I find it absolutely baffling, the earnings are non-existant, awful ratios, they're bleeding money and yet they get 30% gains in 6 hours.

Has the market ever been this way? 

Is the future earning/prospects really that strong of a sentiment than overrides financial logic?

Makes me FOMO, even got a little bit in TLRY for the law and politics side (full speculative ofc), and the gains in a day razed some long stocks I'm holding.

yeah i made a post about investing AGAINST the hype. I personally wouldn't touch the EV / green energy sector right now. but i could be completely wrong. i also wouldn't touch Chinese stocks which is pushed by reddit 24/7.

I like the recovery plays far more. i feel the market is still out of balance due to COVID. (when everyone just pilled in tech out of fear) and its going to rebalance again and i want in the beaten down stocks before it happen.

I went all in CCL back in march @ $9 and sold at $23. (risky i know but i had to take the chance, once in a lifetime opportunity)

i then dumped most of that $$ into XOM on Dec. 31st (timed that one well) 

a day or two later i added ET (this was recommended to me by a co-worker who is about 25 years older than me after i told him about me XOM play). 

He made about 2million off of "ARWR" a few years ago so i just kind of took his advice on this one TBH. But its a recovery play and i was already in XOM so wasn't to big of a shift in my strategy.

Time will tell i guess.

It will peak at 69, then gap up to 420.
I saw other talking DD about BB and did a little research saw they are way down and trending up. Seems like a good buy. So then I start browsing the options for days far out and close to find a good price I'm able to afford to loose. If happen to find these stupid cheap contracts and it's close to matching the timeframe of a uptrend I buy. Figured that this shit has to be above $10 by next year. I'm probably screwing myself because there are the greeks which hell you know what timeframe to buy but I don't speak greek yet.

A stock-for-stock merger occurs when shares of one company are traded for another during an acquisition. When, and if, the transaction is approved, shareholders can trade the shares of the target company for shares in the acquiring firm's company. These transactions‚Äîtypically executed as a combination of shares and cash‚Äîare cheaper and more efficient as the acquiring company does not have to raise additional capital.

It's doing well and the underlying has only gone from like $49.5 to what it has now.

I bought just before that correction, so am a little wary and safe with it.

I don't mind giving a few % top end for that nice lower breakeven point.

I would argue that the short squeeze is valuable for him and GME. Bringing way more exposure to the brand. Ultimately leading to a nice little offering to raise capital. Overall great publicity if they want people to buy in on their plans.

He is halfway right; this isn't even short squeeze prices, this is just the lower limit of fair value, but not taking into account the beneficial changes from having Cohen et al om board. I've said it before and I will say it again, this stock should be at very least 80 without short squeeze

The buying opportunity of a lifetime for big oil might have just ended with the recent runup. My XOM went from almost $40 to over $50 since Jan 1. It's still a good time to buy. This is a buy and hold forever stock. The bull case for oil and gas isn't war, it's Asia (especially China) and it's the decline of coal.

Time in the market always beats timing the market. My suggestion would be etfs throughout time until you‚Äôre able to learn and read more to get a better understanding of what you‚Äôre preferences are

This cost me a cpl $k to learn... Think I have a grasp on it now. Think of it like this: you can buy and sell options like the rights to a bet, "I bet you $XYZ will be $$$ by ##/##  date". If you made that bet today and things started going your way as you approach the strike date, you'd be confident you are going to win your bet. You'd be ITM (in the money). 
Now you could either keep that bet all the way until the strike date or you could sell it to someone else. They'd pay you a premium for the rights to your bet since it already looks likely that you'll win it. Of course the same would be true in the opposite direction if stocks ever went down, but luckily they don't.

The natural flow will be for dealers to buy a bit on stable price throughout the day as all the in the money calls have delta for to 1. Price rises on that. At some point, people will begin to dump their calls to dealers. I don‚Äôt know when that happens enough to offset the buy but certainly by the afternoon and absolutely at 330 NY time.

Ok so you good in your case. People are buying those calls now. If the stock craters (which it wont) your calls will be worthless whether you can sell em or not. 

Theoretically if you really needed to get out. Start selling onesies and twosies at a time. Work your way down from the position. Maybe exercise 1 at a time, sell the position, the. Exercise another.

I don't understand the $BB love. My company used to use a secure email app called Good. Good was acquired by BlackBerry, so the app became BlackBerry email.

Even though the companion apps didn't do anything, if you deleted them from your phone the email would stop working. My company switched to Outlook for iPhone/Android a year later and everyone was thrilled.

Did she get the original 1200$ 

If you paid taxes last few years and got direct deposit returns it should direct deposit to you account. 

If not you get a paper check. Some are required to go on irs.gov to input up to date info to claim check. 

If she didn‚Äôt get the original 1200, it will be a credit to her on 2020 taxes when she files. She will essentially get an extra 1200 back in tax returns. It is called the economic impact rebate when filing. However she can go on IRS.gov and get new 600$ issued and or see what he status is.

To split portfolio or not to split portfolio? I'm looking at SP500 benchmark and it seems to be outperforming Vanguard 2065, but I'm concerned that a lot of that is due to the Covid boom where everyone that had some money made money.

Looking at 50% up currently. Been holding 761 shares at 10$ since before the crash. I had several panic attacks. Freaking pleased now tho. Current environment looks like a melt up in a lot of places, I'm looking to hold on for a bit, and if shit goes south.... this is still gonna be trading at 20$/share in the next 24 months.

Hindsight is 20/20. Virtually everything I sold at a loss this year rocketed after but none as fast as Minerco.. I sold it because I was impatient and it started running 5 min after the trade. That one hurt...

Fair assesment, i have been holding Pfizer since March, and I picked up Moderna in August (sold in December). Looking at the Moderna growth and locked in gains, it never seemed like Pfizer went through that same growth throughout the year (granted pfizer has 4 times the market cap of moderna so the same growth wouldn't be expected). It just seems like there's so much more room for Pfizer to be a big player in covid response now and in the future, and the stock price doesn't seem to reflect that.
> Tell me again how bitcoin will remain unregulated lmao

Regulation requires control of the controller and since no one controls btc (except maybe the semi-obvious 51%+ mining share China holds) there's no way to regulate it outside of record keeping for users within the states. 

Really the only legislation they could do is steep tax penalties, unless the gov. wants to break out more Patriot Act interpretations out on exchange owners like they did with E-gold, but even then, American's will just flip on a VPN and use another exchange. 

At the end of the day, this article actually supports the argument of why regulating BTC is useless. Some blockchain analysts discovered this connection. If it was supposed to be top-secret, they didn't do a good job. I imagine the US Gov has quite the blockchain analysis team as well. 

This really is no different than someone next-day shipping cash to all these folks. Really criminality boils down to whether or not the recipients conducted themselves unlawfully with the funds however the timing of the article pretty much prevents them from 'accidentally' forgetting to report the donation on their 2020 taxes. 

To me, it looks like everything working the way it should. Bonus tinfoil: The US Gov likes the idea that people think BTC is anonymous and that certain unnamed 'privacy coins' are "untrackable" because it lures criminal into a false sense of security along a web of documentation and irrefutable timestamps as they conduct their criminal enterprise.

Cool story. I‚Äôve been trading as well since the pandemic started and my story is a lot like yours. I lost a lot of money and even gave up a few times last year. What turned everything around for me was researching the company that I would be swing traded and coming up with a plan (e.g. purchase price, exit plan, catalysts, risk %, etc.). I literally have a spreadsheet showing each investment along with notes and my plans so that at the end of the day I can go back to my notes and be able to stick to my plan. In just two months I‚Äôve grown my account by about the same percentage. Good luck!
Why do you assume calls being excersised? My fear is alot of ppl just taking profits, so the shares that were secured for these calls are getting sold by their dealers again

Excellent post u/fieryskyes.  Given how far and fast we've traveled already, it seems easy to lost sight of the fact that shorts are staring at a really challenging math problem--and paying more and more to prolong the inevitable.  This has always been one of the most unique investment opportunities that many of us may see in our lifetimes.  And now the fire has been lit and shorts are running for the exists or attempting to blow out the flames themselves with more shorting, which just adds more oxygen if they can't push down a reversal.  Some patience will definitely be rewarded it seems to me, as this fire already seems a bit out of control. 

It sounds like we may have some head winds tomorrow with options expiration, so could be a good day to enter and for the action to consolidate a bit.  But given those headwinds and the likely anticipation by shorts that they might be able to exit without further damage, if we still see a major spike on volume, it seems like we could go parabolic quickly.  

Isn't this fun?  And this, dear Rocket Children, is why you never ever dig in on a short position in a heavily shorted stock--especially when a brilliant activist investor is engineering a tech-centric turnaround while buying up the float...
get a new name and see if that helps.
I'm not well versed enough in that interaction to confidently say itll have an impact. It's also not so much a squeeze inducing event but rather a buy-pressure event

Wouldn't whoever bought them be exercising them anyway?
My 100 BB shares I bought ~10 minutes ago are already up 2%. Get in while you can. Buy calls. Buy shares. Sell covered calls. Whatever floats your boat.
It's up 50% the last month. Have some fucking patience, it's a great long term hold. Sit back and relax
Counterpoint: buy thousands of dollars worth of options

Oh does Robinhood auto-exercise if it needs to?
Personally I would have closed the Jan call and rolled the Feb call up to 35 strike. Not a huge fan of WFC but you would take some money off the table while staying exposed to the Biden speech and the potential for 10yr yield to keep increasing.

The lesson you learned today should be:

Every time you trade a single-stock option, you should know how many earnings events it captures and when they fall. Every time.
Aged like a fine wine this post did. They probs really hate wsb now

You have to have strength and hold. It‚Äôs better also to buy on the dips. I bought MGNI after the short report and now I‚Äôm sitting on a profit after a few weeks of holding
Sweet! Thanks man. This is the kinda story you want to see and enjoy.
Should I get out of CCIV and pour it into BB? Bought in right as the Lucid Motors rumor was taking off, 1 CCIV share is like 1.7 BB shares

I‚Äôd go at least March for $115s personally but I‚Äôm slightly less risky than most on here.  Do some call spreads if you are concerned about price. If playing February ideally the lower end of the spread is 100 or 105

Double in a week?
Dudes made millions off this play.  Wish I was him too
damn imagine having parents who could loan 10k
Depends how OTM the put strike is. Closer the strike is to the actual share price the more shares the MM will short to hedge the put they sold. When share price =strike the MM will need to be short about 50 shares for every put contract sold (contracts being worth 100 shares). If the put is deep ITM the MM will need to be short 100 shares for every put contract they sold.

Something like that anyway.

So I think... net unhelpful to the squeeze as the MM would need to short in order to hedge themselves.

I have some calls. You should post positions or ban.
One thing about Gamestop ive never seen mentioned here is the Pokemon cards. If you haven't noticed (or been out of the game since you were a kid) Pokemon Cards have legit boomed over the last year, pretty much since lockdown started. Price for cards, especially the old ones have 100x with the rise of youtube ppl opening packs. Gamestop literally sells so much fucking pokemon online (i know, ive purchased a ton, and a lot of it sells out super quick) so this has to also be a nice bump to keeping them alive.

&#x200B;

Next time you're even at Walmart, check the pokemon aisle, it will be cleaned out along with the rise of sporting cards.

Anyway, GME to the fucking MOON

So from 2018 to pre-covid, they were already on a steady decline. I could see a situation where they reach those 2018 numbers again, but that is just a positive guess. For the short-term, they'll probably get back to April 2020 numbers.

No, unlike with a hardship withdrawal, they deliberately do not ask. Was like a back door stimulus package. You just has to check a box saying you were negatively effected and believe you meet the criteria.
This is more of a r/canadianInvestor question tbh.

As a fellow retarded Canadian, I have both a personal and TFSA account and trade in both. I do dumb day trades in my personal and just hold on the stuff in my TFSA. 

From what I've heard you only get audited if they consider that your day trading in your TFSA is a business and main source of income. That being said I haven't read up on it too much.

Be mindful that diagonal spreads lose money if the underlying stock moves too favorably too fast. Your short contract can outstrip your gains on the LEAP and even chew through your premium in extreme cases.
Older investors can hate but times are changing. Can people make a few extra bucks off of stocks because of memes? Damn right. Are some people just taking massive bets and throwing it all in on a stock because social media pumps it up? Damn straight. 

They wouldn‚Äôt be scrutinizing the younger generations if they themselves lived in our era. If warren buffet was our age and became wealthy with what we now, I guarantee that his advice would be different.

This a thousand times. So GME peaked at 38 yesterday and missed. So made an autistic hypothesis it will peak at 43 today and swing the shares at dip. The üåàüêª in me üßªüôå at 38 when it started peaking again to 43!!! Dont worry though, gonna buy in again at dip (grabs callculator)

I doubt it. After market is still holding pretty strong and there are tons of shorts to be unwound. 

There new support is probably around the $36-$38 mark, and I can‚Äôt see if falling through that. 

Tomorrow we should hopefully break $40, creating a new floor.
No idea; can‚Äôt play anything for long.

we goin to 50 tomorrow
I dont see any bullish patterns. You mean it might bounce from the uptrend line?
A little further support to this theory is that last major volume price explosion was October 8th, a Thursday. On that day the price of GME went from $9 to $13 on a volume of 70M (which was a record for GME) and on the 9th it hit a high of $14.80 before selling off down to $12. If memory serves the selling didn't take place until around noon, and the total drop from high to low was around 20%, but the total move from Wednesday's close to Friday's high was around 70%. We've had a roughly 125% move from Tuesday's low to today's high, I would expect that if we drop it will be down to around $30.  


I plan on picking up 0DTE $40p tomorrow, ideally if it gets to $45, which is also where I'll be selling a few more of my April calls.  


Current position: 15 Apr 20c, 200 shares.

BB will go to the moon. Not because of shorts, not because of meme stock. BUT BECAUSE OF PROPER VALUATION
Yo you bois mind pumping SRPT and show Moma Cathie some love, gene editing is the fkg future and my boy SRPT is at a 50% discount. Remember when Cathie bought FSLY when it dipped like 40%, and then it zoomed to an all-time high, she's doing it again with SRPT, she is buying like no tomorrow. Idk I think you should look into it if you like to buy on dips, there are not many of them right now.
BB just hit an all time high in after-hours! My wife‚Äôs boyfriend can smd üòà
Whats "shares", precious?
Multi trillion dollar bill. Missing a few trillion.
facts down big
BS. There aren‚Äôt that many GME shares
Glad I‚Äôm out the only one buying in at $38. The sub has fully corrupted me in 12hours. My wife is going to murder mer
Badass, I made 10% on HP today 6k
I sold the put, IV is high and I wouldn't mind getting assigned at a discount to today's prices.
I'm still holding, shit's going to 54 tomorrow
I'm not saying the democrats will cause a market crash, but hotels/airlines/etc.. might drop due to a possible lockdown. Wall street knows this and will take advantage of it. The dems are more likely to lockdown the country if there is a need for it, they have the house and the senate itll be easier for them to do it. With a mutation spreading, people skeptical about vaccines and so on I think it's a possibilty that we'll need a second lockdown.
In 3 days, went from $3.1mm to $7.3mm, massive gains.
Should I buy 4k worth of $BB stocks now or wait til market open? Will probably pick up a couple calls as well
lol for now :S but oooh boy tmr we can see big movement.
I‚Äôm hoping we get an update tomorrow or sometime soon, because I would personally love to see the numbers for short interest
Looks like a bullfrog harmonica crab pattern to me
PLTR the seed now and watch it grow over time. It's a long game for that one. I'm in 400+ shares of PLTR, and I know it's going to go slow.
I think it‚Äôs more likely they break out
what do you mean 21.5 calls?
This guy knows how to enjoy life
Fubo is shorted as fuck and is a legit business as far as I can tell
Oh boy....if he does...then lol

BB 12c 01/29? Good idea, bad idea?
How old?
Same
was gonna say lmao, i was thinking of doing a month long short on it with a strike price of 35, it's too high for a dying company in debt closing locations left and right
I almost want to make fun of you because it is typical of basically every 401k plan on earth, it is usually just a button on your 401k providers website like Fidelity and it is almost always 50% of your vested balance ie you can't borrow 100% against your 401k balance they will give you half as a secured loan and let you pick most of the re-payment terms, often you can just have payroll deducted as well and that is it.
What would the math on that be? Any idea what they need to cover their shorts? How many shares? Cause lets say they bought at both 55 and 40. And for example, by them accelerating the squeeze or then I guess them exercising it themselves lol, the PT end of day is $60. Lets say all 40k at 55 are theirs and say another 40k at 40 (for example but prob much less), they would make around 30M each for 60M total. But will have added $20 per share they have to cover? The question is how many shares did they borrow, is it in any of the DDs.
this is the way
450,000-500,000, exactly what I thought you said.
Attendance for retards who bought $BB. We are waiting for FB settlement tomorrow üöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
BUY GME CALLS AND SHARES
what do you think it will open at tomorrow. I bought some after hours
Surprised this isn't the highest upvoted comment. Probably the best very recent example of extreme irrational exuberance. Took almost 3 years for this bubble to pop, and valuations are still pretty high. 

Similarly to Tesla, no matter how you did the math, even when accounting for 100% market dominance, the valuations didn't make sense.
That's it. Do you want in? Cuz I will actually do this
Yes
Just drove past a middle aged man in a leather jacket holding a picket sign saying everything in gamestop is 70% including fixtures

I'm buying puts tomorrow.
they just posted that 2 hours ago!!!
So it's a win then.

Nice.
Joe, please say the following:

1.) 1.5tn Stimulus

2.) 2.4tn Infrastructure bill focusing on clean energy 

3.) telehealth was a massive success during Covid, pumping money into increasing telehealth adoption. TDOC awarded $200bn dollar contract and named company of the century. Stock price legally mandated to rise 69%. 

4.) ‚ÄúTesla to Mars.‚Äù

5.) ‚ÄúGod Bless America‚Äù

good luck.

Crazy to think that it‚Äôs only the beginning, I appreciate your informative reply, good luck to you and may GME take us to the promise land
The reason I'm asking is because soma guy on a website that shall not be named (lookingBeta) spent his whole day writing an article with all kinds of technical analysis, trying to prove that GME was a shit company that was going to fail, and all of us here on wsb would look like idiots. I was thinking to myself 'Hell, I'll go balls deep in $KKK or $NAZI if it would make me a profit, I DGAF about whether or not the company lives/thrives'. I just was curious if it was just me or not. Looks like that question has been answered. Glad I'm not the only one that thinks the author completely missed the mark.
of course he is going to pump clean energy, but on the clean energy companies that gave him money.  Quid pro Joe is back in the game...  The question is, what clean energy companies paid him?
By next morning at this rate...
Biden sending out $1400...not bad homie not bad
It's been 17 months since he posted his first Jan 15 2021 call, this position has a gestation period close to an Indian Elephant
The squeeze has not squoze
52 week high hit on BB? Idgaf I‚Äôm buying FDs at open bitch. ALL IN.
It‚Äôs gonna keep going.  Their ad revenue is fucked...on top of everything else.
Lolol
Is there a link to his channel? I can‚Äôt seem to find it
Damn nice! Is your main account bigger than half a milli? Idk how some of you guys are bringing in these stellar numbers.

1/15 $39 and 1/22 $40 calls
Yeah, a true revival of the pokemon franchise would be huge for Nintendo and GameStop.
Should I still buy GME now even if I can only afford 10?
What kind of encouragement should we throw? "Hey man, don't give up, keep underperforming the market"?

OP clearly needs some guidance, because whatever he's doing is obviously wrong.
Sounds like you‚Äôre way too overqualified for this shithole. It‚Äôs basically the dirty couch lol
Wth?? Why? Though green announcement was supposed to help?
lol GME gonna still go up in the coming weeks
Every one grilling this person but no offense if I had kids living with me till almost 40 they would ruin my FIRE plans... staring 15 years ago.

I've given up in the short term already barring any new partnerships or big news.  I think this will be a great med-long term play though so I'm just gonna keep holding my shares

The real question is if this experience and profit makes him more or less likely to do something similar in the future
I'd say it's relative because you'll need to sell in the next three weeks.
I don‚Äôt think pdt shouldn‚Äôt be a thing but I think the 25k req is way too high
Dump it into GME
Stfu the whole point is to make money with risky trades not only sticking to bullish plays.watch the market shift in a year and retards like you are gonna get ass fucked on every play.

I'll be making $15/H at wendy's after this stimmy üòè
Plus he knows we would repay the favor by buying loads of Tesla shares and calls and diamond handing the shit out of them, win win for everybody
Bonk
It was a March expiry too lol. I belong here
Like a true retard, I bought 20 $12 3/19c early December because I saw BB meme with rocket ship emojis on it. They were like .08 at one point and I forgot about them until today ü§ë
I just googled Rod Alzmann twitter, I don‚Äôt have an actual Twitter account
When Walrus speaks.. you listen.
Gonna open $43-45 from the margins calls. Then the gamma squeeze kicks in with all the new call options vaulting us to ~$47. At this point we break free from algorithms ability to control things as all technical analysis fails in the extreme tail of projections with high volatility. I have no clue where we go from there. $55 seems a conservative estimate. Infinity squeeze could happen but it‚Äôs a slim chance
Nice additional dd. Watch out on the 0dte can get liquidated into an incredible close. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm using next week, my account doesn‚Äôt have a lot of margin flex at the moment.
Best Buy
Yeah true that‚Äôs a good amount of money I was up to 30k but yeah some bad trades. But just put all that shit in dividends and growth and you might not ever have to work again!!
Thank u bb

Got VALE calls out to June. Super bullish, only thing I worry about is it looks like Biden might be pushing off unveiling his infastructure plan.

Also risk it falling down again haha. But you‚Äôre right. It feels very wrong to exercise before expiration.

On BP's share buyback program expected to start Q3-Q4

>Our buyback scenario analysis results show that under our current macro Commodities team's oil price deck, BP can potentially buy back US$1.2bn in 2021 and US$4.1bn in 2022, resulting in an annual yield of c.1.5% and 5.0% respectively. We note that despite the dividend cut the company announced in 2020, BP currently offers a 5.1% dividend yield (2021E), which, with the addition of the buyback programme as outlined above, could result in total cash returns to shareholders of 6.6%/10.1% in 2021/22 respectively.

2nd users actually a very big market for industrial and commercial parts. Plus their refurbishment areas are now certified. 

Shoes finatics are a MAJOR purchaser. In fact collectible shoe sales increased hugely in the paSt year. In a time of pinching pennies where you go christmas shopping the discount store... ding and ding. This is going to 60. Possibly beyond. The PE ratio is 7... thats crazy. After earnings it might be like 4.
Didn‚Äôt get any last year either
added 1725 shares today
Last week on the 7th, big dip on earnings. I‚Äôm up over 600% on BBBY calls if you peep my profile
Get back on the horse next week! And get some some of that sweet 20% GME margin tomorrow to tide you over.
they just posted it on the website.. no news yet
Still stand by what I said. Maybe it‚Äôs a great meme stock to do some calls for a few months. Terrible 401K dump.
Weeklies during earnings is almost always a surefire bet
yes. Once exercised. But they won't be exercised so long as they retain extrinsic value. Example: Stock worth 45, call at 44. Exercise for 1$ value or sell for 3$ price? Until the call no longer has that 2$ of value granted to it by time, there's no incentive to exercise. However, there IS an incentive for the person who sold the call to COVER by buying the stock directly.

He made that bet against a hedge fund that took 2% fees and 20% of profit, as a direct bet against the two-and-twenty fee structure.  The owner of the hedge fund even said his own funds weren't even designed to beat the market and that the bet was worth it just to have direct access to Buffet.  His basket also did exceedingly poor over the time span

Wow. This isnt autism, this is something else.
Go to babypips and learn about risk management. Also, take it easy with the pushups if you haven't done them in a long time because you could rip a muscle or develop tendonitis. Maybeix up the exercises and decreasebthe number or reps?
there are also razor thin margins in the business and customers prefer the black market stuff anyway, because it's not stale and old like OTC stuff.

I have precisely zero idea other than luck. I use TDAmeritrade. I began in March of 2020. Initially put $200 in and added another $100 two weeks later. Since I've just been buying and selling essentially whenever I feel like it (while avoiding pattern day trading rule). General practice I've followed is sell after any one particular stock hits a 10% gain but it's not a steadfast rule. I avoid the hyper popular things like tesla and plantatir(sp). I have only taken one or two losses over the course of this. My buying habits are based my own intuition or using some of TD's built in screeners. This has been solely a fun little experiment for me and is by no means related to any actual financial plan. My retirement planning and investments are completely separate.  Essentially I couldn't go play Blackjack because of COVID so the stock market became the spot for a little bit of "fun" money to be spent (and then I started playing on "house" money, so I never added any more).
so the pussies at melvin have to close their positions tomorrow before market close, if not that shit is gonna expire, so the GME peak has to come before close right?

6.) Cramer is head of $$ now.
SCR (theScore) is essentially a Canadian sports media company. That's not interesting. What \*is\* interesting though, is their growth in sports betting and that they're well positioned and fully prepared for upcoming that upcoming legislation that will legalize single-event sports betting in Canada.

Why is it going to the moon?

1) Well positioned to capitalize on legalization of single-event sports betting in Canada. They can leverage their brand, large userbase, and existing betting system (in some US states) to own a big share of the sports gambling market.

2) As a smaller Canadian company, it's overlooked in general. Canadian stocks don't get anywhere near the coverage of US stocks. This means you can get in when undervalued, though it's a weight on the stock until it has a higher market cap.

3) Prime candidate for buyout post-legalization by a larger, likely US company.

4) They're planning to list on a US stock exchange as well, leading to an influx of new investors.

The stock is already up huge, but will go higher. So strap in autistonauts, SCR will  **üöÄüöÄüöÄ**  to the moon!

I've concluded getting more money is better than getting less money in smaller payments. I've also concluded I can't invest it all in risky growth companies so my largest positions Apple, JP Morgan, Facebook, Microsoft, Disney and Abbvie I'll be keeping. All those which is 51% of my portfolio. Also debating on keeping Raytheon which is 5%. Probably letting go Store Capital. The rest of my holdings are growth plays.
well enjoy the interest on the loan. And pending where you live expect to lose 40% of that gain....so calculate that in before you stick the money back in the 401k before it defaults and you get a 10% penalty + taxes.

>I might be stupid but i see no money flowing to AMD investors while the shares get diluted by new shares sold by management

This is as dumb as saying:

>I might be stupid but i see no money flowing to AMD investors while the company pays its employees

They're diluting their company through 2 things: one of them is employee compensation, and it's standard for basically all public companies. Those insider trades you linked to are related to employee compensation. The other dilutive event is AMD selling stock to raise capital to invest in projects. It dilutes shareholders while not changing the overall value of an investors holdings, because for every dollar of dilution, the balance sheet of the company improves by a dollar. 

Another example: Let's say there's a company that is literally $10, and it has 10 shares, of which you own 1. I sell an additional share of stock for $1. Oh no! Now you don't have 10% of the company anymore! You only have 9%! You've been diluted! Your new percentage of the company is worth.... $1! A loss of $0.00! Incredible! Math!

>Intel pays dividends and the shares are not constantly getting diluted so i like Intel better.

It's fine to like Intel more than AMD. It's fine to like a stable dividend company instead of a growth company. But your arguments for why you like it literally make no sense. "I like the sky because it's brown!" Well, it's fine to like the sky, but that doesn't make your qualifier true. Same concept here: you may like Intel more than AMD, but your reasoning is predicated on a misunderstanding of dilutive events and the financial ramifications of them.

Hey lemme know if I'm being retarded, in a bad way, but how big is their short position.  Cause lets say they bought at both the way OOTMS at dirt cheap and the IV crushed OTMs (55C and 40C). And for example, by them accelerating the squeeze or then I guess them exercising it themselves lol, the PT end of day is $60. Lets say all 40k at 55 are theirs and say another 40k at 40 (for example but prob much less), they would make around 30M each for 60M total. I'm getting these numbers from this [DD](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxdn4u/gme_very_likely_to_go_to_47_or_more_tomorrow_480/) of the option volumes.

Appreciate this! Yeah I am definitely a long term holder of DIS. Really strong leadership and offerings. Once the vaccine starts to fully kick there is no reason for DIS to lose momentum.

Probably a good time to buy

Retraced off the November Amazon pump news to the 0.618 fib like a fucking textbook.
Boomers and their allies were holding on for dear life to keep the GME price below 40, tomorrow GME is gonna launch out the gate like the Atlas V
Where can I watch this biden thing online
Have 10 long term calls for the fuck of it. It could go back to $13. Who knows.

yall think the FBI is onto something, or preparing for boogaloo violence as forecasted on inauguration day?
MSTR will be this years TSLA. But as with everything so far in 2021, it will be bigger.
What is it?? Wagecucking rn, wasn‚Äôt able to hear
I‚Äôd go the visa gift card route - if your mom can see your online banking she‚Äôs probably joint with you on the account, since you‚Äôre 18 you can open a checking account anywhere by yourself and if you opt for e-statements she‚Äôd never have to know
Yup worse than just losing lol
What's your top EV though
LOL YOLO!!! may your tendies be extra crispy and delicious
Those people had no fucking idea haha. Prolly also all wiped out from FDs
Just a retard me, but I think DFV timed it with the recurring IRC or ICR meeting or however it‚Äôs called. Plus the graphs of 2 gen cycles in the stock charts and hoping GME goes digital or bust
I accidentally wandered into r/thetagang those fuckers are depressing
After doing more research, they seem to have been extremely adversely effected by the Covid lockdowns, suspending employees 401k match, furloughs, deferring tent payments, etc. to conserve cash. On the other hand, the CEO and CFO have bought back tens of thousands of shares over the last month
Bought 11 shares of BB at 9.50 and then immediately broke 10 20 minutes later haha... I wish I wasn‚Äôt poor
I just started reading a month ago. I just made 1000% off a $75 GameStop option. $30 1/15... you all know where I learned this power.

Thanks, dude. Your brain has more wrinkles than me
All those over 40s unite!
Yep waiting for that too with 1/29 140c I bought 3 days ago lol. Love tsm
Likely a heavy bull run, but it is causing the interest rates on short positions to skyrocket, making holding them much more uncomfortable on top of the massive value loss to their positions since the stock has soared over 100% this week alone. This could be viewed as maybe a pre-squeeze, shaking out maybe some of the smaller shorts, but the big ones are still there and they took out even more short positions today. It could initiate a full squeeze, though, very soon. Given the outstanding short interest, it could be epic.
Which just leads to the creation of a new sub - WallStreetWagers
Yes exactly this. It's why I'm trying to catch as many sunsets as I can this winter. It is half an hour where my only job is to enjoy the scenery and eat a snack before packing up and biking home

Apparently so, too many factors, weak hands...idiots buying shares on margin accounts etc.

All good, in this mission we all in the same gang
Good job! Keep pushing!
My guess is that it is a robotic/drone/data-based farming thing. I couple of other recent ARK buys (RAVN, TRMB) are pretty pure plays in that area. Either that or people are just coming to realize that nothing runs like a Deere.

Strap up and strap-on boys, EVERYTHING is gapping up tonight!!!
how is it going to squeeze if they themselves aren't buying the shares. We're talking about two different type of squeezes, a short squeeze caused by people HAVING to buy back no matter what at any price and a gamma squeeze which is caused by options.

Without the buying pressure of the short squeeze the gamma squeeze is unlikely. Elsewise, you would just permanently see every stock squeeze due to options. If they start buying options, the odds are that those options will end up expiring worthless.
Too late to get on this train?!!  Just grabbed 100 shares in the afters. Should I also grab some OTM leaps at open tomorrow?

What broker do you use to sell puts? 

Reason I'm asking, I'm currently trading with a margin account on IBKR but keeps indicating 'Not enough funds'. I thought selling puts gives you a credit initially, so wouldn't there not need to be any balance?

A) Get a margin account and start trading options ASAP.  
B) You CAN buy calls and puts, and even sell covered calls in your TFSA.   
Buy LEAPS, buy FDs, farm theta, whatever you want. There are "options" to what you can do with your TFSA, and I don't think CRA or whoever will come knocking.

I made a post about this (got taken down because I forgot positions) and then I updated it and that also got taken down. Basically the post was how I got massacred by PRPL last year and since then I‚Äôve had trust issues with anything on here. Thing is every bullish OP for a stock pick is convinced theirs is the next flight to the moon. After seeing everything with GME, I feel like I was sucked back in but not with something that already lifted off, I want a train that just started to go CHOO CHOO, and that for me is BB.

You may find (I did) that work is providing a lot of structure and schedule in your life that you weren't aware of.  You get up every day, shower, dress, eat, etc, on schedules that are designed to meet work requirements.  When work stops, you may lose that structure and need to replace it with something of your own.  It may help having a second person in your household to maintain patterns.

Retiring from work is satisfying, but retiring TO something is even better.  Do you have any other ideas how you might like to spend all that time that used to go to work, besides your travel plans, or maybe that's enough to focus on to start?

failed acquisition so it's either going to IPO or SPAC. not sure how a failed acquisition by visa would hurt Mastercard though

This week is the most autistic the market has been for us.

I think it‚Äôs always good to mentally prepare for a dip when you‚Äôre diamond handing a moon shot. But given the current momentum, I strongly doubt any massive dip tomorrow especially with so many worthless puts expiring.
LMND bulls are retarded so no
Ooof this one gotta hurt
look into TNXP and IBIO they are about to fly 

if you want to make a quick buck invest in BIOL and OPGN
For sure, I didn‚Äôt take that risk sounds like you didn‚Äôt either. Seems like a win win, OP has a shit load of money and you‚Äôre happy you didn‚Äôt take that same risk
Yeah but the timing of him getting GME to bounce over 100% in the final week is what people are getting at. Most would have sold after the first bounce.
STIMMYS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
Just got off a call from my boy H.Biden and he tells me that the big guy loves him some underaged girls, Viagra, naps in the basement, and investing 10% of the stimulus into some stonk called GME. Use this information as you wish

Needing a bit of a think tank. Does anyone have any recommendations about what all to look for when researching companies?

I'm pretty new to the investing world. I have put in about $1400 in stocks and about $1100 in crypto. However, last year I was given 18 shares of TGT.  It's done quite well, almost doubling since I got it, and I want to think that there's more room for growth. However, I'm also not sure that I want to risk a big downturn with how much it's grown in a year. I'm starting to think about pulling it out and putting it into an ETF but I can't decide. I know timing the market is a fools errand but I want to ride the wave for as long as I can.
Is it too late to get some calls? I was about to pull the trigger on 1 contract 12.5c 1/22
Same here, such a long stretch but after that‚Äôs it‚Äôs pretty nice.

Id say europe cares way more than USA does.
Here‚Äôs what Biden calls for:

Direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans, bringing the total relief to $2,000 including December‚Äôs $600 payments
Increasing the federal, per-week unemployment benefit to $400 and extend it through the end of September
Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour
Extending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of September
$350 billion in state and local government aid
$170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education
$50 billion toward Covid-19 testing
$20 billion toward a national vaccine program in partnership with states, localities and tribes
Make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable for the year and increase the credit to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for a child under age 6)
The merger gives 0.83 TLRY shares for each APHA share. APHA is currently trading below that ratio so if you buy APHA and the merger goes through you would hold more TLRY at the end.
Lol omg this is so retarded.

So essentially they‚Äôd either spend $960 for 100 shares of a stock at $9.60 OR they spend $954 for 100 shares at $9 right?

The latter being the obvious choice because they not only pay less but they‚Äôre getting the stock at a discount.

Some people spend every waking moment on trade ideation and tool development, and others don't. It's entirely a function of your own time management and headspace allocation.

If you're planning your trades around catalysts, it's possible to do your research overnight, trade from your phone, and exit positions aggressively once catalysts pass -- whether or not you made money.

The problem is that you need to get the information into your brain somehow, and for me that means a comfortable dedicated space, external monitors, and constant attention to the news.

If you can see your catalysts coming from a mile away, then you can plan your research to not interfere with your readings. There's a different kind of focus for legal reading than for trading research -- for me at least. I try to be active and sensitive when trading, but dispassionate and trancelike when reading anything legal or technical.

It's hard for me to think about anything unrelated to the markets when I'm running risk, so in your position I'd probably take one-day positions around catalysts so that I can stay risk-off most of the time.
I'm gonna Guess Joe's $15/hr minimum wage doesn't make it.  Don't think he could even get all the democrats on board with that one.

Thanks for explaining. I'm pretty new to this. So I'm torn between expecting a run-up tomorrow morning or if it just goes sideways for a while as the shorters are maybe expecting de-hedhing in the afternoon and wait till then with covering their positions, so no strong price increases?

If there should be a bullish morning though, would it be good to try to close long positions at that peak before the de-hedhing starts increasing in the afternoon driving price back down? 

I want to make clear I don't expect advice of any kind, but I appreciate comments on these ideas very much as additional input for my decision!

Because covered calls are free money for bulls if you bet correctly, despite being bearish. The market is not binary bear or bull bets.

It's easy to overlook because everyone here is into derivatives until the IV gets too high (i.e., GME), but if you hold allotments of 100 shares and don't sell OTM calls against them, I don't know why you'd have an options account in the first place. You're leaving money on the table. Reducing cost basis 101.

We in trouble now boys.  My GF now has a RH account and $1k in GME.  She's over in her office laughing at all your dumb memes
Shares are fine, you just have to sell when the price is up. Dude bought calls, which are basically bets that the stock will have risen to a certain price by a certain date. This allows you to buy a stock for a cheaper price than the current value, if you so choose, by offering a small "down payment". But it's optional to buy it, hence a call being an "option". He bought a 10 call for March, meaning if the stock rises to $10 in March, he's made money by "reserving" it at the current price. But he only loses a little bit if it goes down and he chooses not to buy it, instead of losing the actual value lost (like when you buy a share and it goes down).

Straight fucked.  Go long.
Agreed.  I'm a lot of things, but "social" is not one of them.
Thank you, it is insane! I'm trying to follow what exactly is going on with the call (how it works) and what the cost basis is in it.

Balloons are much more steerable then people realize.  Wind often goes different directions at different heights.  You can use that to help move where you want to be.  Believe it or not there are even competitions for this where you fly the balloon to specific spots and try to be the most accurate.
It always get graduated like over 5 years.

They'll allow the states to have say in it.
The other options and strike prices would get you ITM a lot easier, why risk a $4c?
Sheesh my taxes aren‚Äôt looking good right now, very bad. Unintentionally got awash sale, anyway to get out of it
This is so accurate lmaooo
Excellent. glad to hear it!
Got 5 Upvotes on my Question if I should buy BB, so let's goooo bois

(probably gonna loose everything)
13 is where we say fuck you to wall street and climb into our rocket and go to the moon.
440 shares @14.something
and yeah i was looking at dividends, 10k in both mcdonalds and coke seem to be good but also ive heard MP is great too. I wanna try and balance my portfolio between ETFS dividends and growth stocks. Im think 30/30/40 would be a safe balance
What did you buy in at?
I have a reasonable amount too believe in the company. It will go a long way.

In my thinking, going from $7m to $4m is worse than not going from $7m to $10m or something.

I thought volatility was a terrible measure of risk, at least according to Buffett-sama
Stop spamming this.
Today I lost enough money to buy a McChicken sandwich with a medium soda
One more question. If I place a trade after hours at 5:01p, as a market order, does my trade get executed in order or receipt? Ie after anyone trading before 5:01p but before anyone trading after.
üò≤

That alone would send wmt down 10 percent.
BB mooned and up 10% after hours
Chasing is when you buy into something that is already running hard and liable to peak. This usually means you end up buying at the top price and are left ‚Äòholding bags‚Äô because the price crashes and doesn‚Äôt recover for a long time. 

It‚Äôs also known as purchase by FOMO (fear of missing out). 

Instead of chase you should *dig* a position in a spot liable to run in the future. Then wait for it to take off and sell. 

You find out which ones are going to run by doing DD (due diligence aka reading a lot of shit).
EVERYONE JUMP ON
Guys are happy making 0.0001% gains while risking a butt load. I want moon gains and risk everything and then some
Or shirts that say "I spent millions of dollars on GME puts and all I got was this stupid t-shirt"

nope, just that massive sell order keeping it flat. blessed be thy hands, deep be thy fuckin value.
Would you consider a 9% jump in a single day massive? Do NOT compare it to the ridiculous moves that GME has done lol.
God's gonna call you for stock advice tomorrow
adult dependents are in for a check under that biden proposal. let's fucking go baby, all in on BB
It‚Äôs over $10 now. Calls about to print tomorrow
There is also the extremely conspicuous sales pitch pressure selling language. "Last chance guys", "Everybody else is getting in", "Think about how you'll feel if you miss out". Get fucked my man. 

Even the "disclaimer" at the end is actually meant to reassure you. Hey, this guy has $50k to piss away on penny stocks, he must know what's up/have faith in TANH. This is real basic shit, please do not fall for it.

The argument for across the board min wage is dumb af, should be tacked to cost of living
amzn already has a $15 min wage.
Their growth is almost as good as their turkey chili
Take a look a the top 20 of the SP500. How many of these are energy companies?  I rest my case.  The Tesla insurance business is bigger than you realize and they will disrupt the auto nsurance business, which is also a massive industry.
The ‚Äúlarge deposit‚Äù explanation letter I‚Äôm going to have to write for my mortgage application should be interesting for them to read.

‚ÄúI YOLO‚Äôd $10k into OTM GameStop calls because these retards on Reddit told me it was a sure thing, something about a short squeeze. I was balls deep in them for two months, until Ryan Cohen took over one week it mooned to fucking Neptune.‚Äù
CANNABIS!!! Tilray (TLRY) about to short squeeze!!!!!
Why?
I looks at my GME calls I sold yesterday. üò≠üò≠üò≠
everyone else‚Äô buying power will be reduced, unless he plans on increasing wages accordingly. Then you‚Äôre looking at inflation.

Old dude will forget what he said before he takes office.
I got in this morning.  Now it‚Äôs up 12%.
Tesla needs to make hydroponics and solar that targets weed growing.
Hell yes. Some blessed strange made me buy a call yesterday. It's up 140% today.  I'm riding this üöÄ

I was looking for bottomed out offering plays on FinViz and it popped up. Did some quick research and I liked the financials and chart.
correct. you can generally expect contracts to sell for the difference between the strike price and the share price + a slight discount.
I agree with you there. I've mostly been very confident throughout my career, but not always. There were a couple low points where my confidence was shot, and that's when I was in those dead-end jobs with lousy management or leadership.
I was promised a biden pump. Why am i redder than close?!?
Could someone that has BB 9.5C for 1/15 tell me what they're worth right now cus I sold mine right before market close today
inb4 someone says Chegg, theres no way gov is funding a cheating platform
It'll likely be a five year phase in starting 2022. They'll have time to adapt. If they can't, fuck 'em. I like my stuff to print as much as the next dude, but businesses should pay a living wage
I sold a BB call up 500% today and am still regretting not holding it
Keep fuelling up the rocketship, we can let them join when we circle the moon at $20 in a month.

Limit sell at 650!
Was locked in my own bathroom for about 10min  because I forgot how to open it, kids dont do drugs it‚Äôll catch up once you‚Äôre older.
BNGO hit my stop loss yesterday. All i feel is pain.
It‚Äôs all going to GME
Yeah I bought 2 $8c 2/12 yesterday for almost no money. Wish I went all in lol
The yield on an investment is the amount of cash flow it pays, period. If you have a thousand dollars in an asset that pays 3%, that‚Äôs $30 cash flow annually. Well what if you paid $500 for that asset originally, what‚Äôs your cash flow?.....Still $30. Your cost doesn‚Äôt change the cash flow from the asset. People try to delude themselves into thinking their yield is somehow higher? The cash flow remains the same. Now in this example the asset appreciated, so you have a capital gain on paper, still doesn‚Äôt change your cash flow.
Weeks? More like months. Homies out here thinking we just randomly picked it up.
A lot of BB talk I‚Äôm scared for my GME 0.0
I bought at $1 yesterday, it's gone up high and then down bit I don't mind cos I believe in the company and the renewables era is just starting so it will climb, biggest thing I've learnt recently at great expense is don't buy on a high unless you think it's still climbing I normally wait an hour after open. And secondly don't pull out for atleast 3 weeks or unless it's loosing rediculous! Otherwise you may as well be in the casino üòÄ
Nahhh it's all about NEE gang
YESSIR
This kid gonna go places.
Sitting on a conservative growth (40/60?) fund is less bad than sitting on cash, but the same logic applies. If you are comfortable with more risk in general, it's better to do it sooner rather than later.
Lol why‚Äôd you buy calls you might as well have bought shares at that price

Thanks to the dude who mentioned BB last week.
I loaded up on 3c 1/20/2023 shortly before close and now I‚Äôm just dreading not being able to spend that money as I ride BB to $20 for the next year

I'm from Canada. I know it's anecdotal, but all my friends and I from university buy weed at legal weed stores. Finding and waiting for a dealer is a hassle, and the weed bought at legal stores is always perfectly dried and cured, and has consistent quality. Plus prices have come down like crazy. 

Come to think of it, I actually don't know anyone personally that still buys weed off the streets....
Anyone holding BB calls?  Looking to open a leap position but IV looks pretty high right now.
Oh shit. BRB.

B f‚Äôing B!!!
Tempered expectations always better than having some GME fantasy shut down brutally.

That being said, I'm basically same position as you, 1.1k shares @16.40 so even if we dip briefly it won't make much of a difference. Dips will be bought.
is it expected to continue tomorrow?
Thank you lord and saviour sir Walrus ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Let‚Äôs be real this drawdown didn‚Äôt work out too well.

It tells you most people have no idea what they are talking about.
Same I just hope theres another dip tommorrow since new strike prices opened up.
IF YOU ARENT BUYING SIRI AND LMND YOU HATE MONEY
Me too. I bought 10 contracts for 10c expiring tomorrow. First time doing this.


Should I sell them before or after the conference?
Is there a catalyst or just hype?
If you bought before Wednesday, you‚Äôre not late.
Things like this are better kept personal.
I leave the rockets to DFV our lord and saviour.

This stock touched the high 6s not too long ago. We told you guys it was gonna be big and to stop looking at them as a phone company.

When this stock hits 100+ how you gonna feel when you ignored us telling you could buy it for single digits and get long term calls for it that would give lots of tendies?
May your tendies be delicious.
Yeah so many people are still hooked on ZOM I am tempted to reenter and double my money again!

Let‚Äôs push BB past its ATH a decade ago!
I‚Äôm hoping $GME hits $45 tomorrow so I can buy another Xbox. My wife‚Äôs boyfriend took my other one.
Everything seems to react faster in the stock market these days. I think this news+FOMO are literally going to kickstart this bitch tomorrow.
What have you heard? Maybe I should sell my ROAD.
Yea way too broke to exercise that shit. Cheers for the help.
As most would say, don't put all your eggs in one basket.
You're a legend just for convincing me
Bought 20 11$ c 1/22 at .59.

BB better be back under $10 by tomorrow‚Äôs closeüòÇ
Joe with the rug pull
I think you have much better odds with $ATVK - if the court rules in their favour (which is seeming likely all things to be believed with the SEC etc) then we should see a spike just due to the cancelled shares being bought back. That‚Äôs before we even see the real momentum from pink current today and future PR. 

Saying that $GME has wsb behind it so honestly who knows when it comes to those degens. 

My bet is $ATVK, but best of luck to you either way!

imagine thinking that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm talking about
Graduating into Rona must absolutely suck, you have my sympathy. If you can finish a maths degree you are smarter than 75% of the work force at a minimum, it might take a while for your salary to reflect that, but it will do eventually as long as you keep making good decisions, learning new things and thinking strategically about the opportunities which arise. If I were you I would look into coding (it doesn't take long to know enough to get a job earning good money) or business intelligence. There is a lot of low hanging fruit smart people can pick in big old businesses, if you can do that a few times you'll do well. I've saved people literally hundreds of hours by making a little power query (literally not even coding, just excel) to compile multiple spreadsheets into one thing based of some webpages, if you can finish maths you can do that and earn well. Again you have my sympathy, but 5-10 years from now you can be absolutely rocking it.

Why is BB mooning?
If your mom freaks out over sensible, necessary expenses like computer repair, you should definitely join the adulting world and get your own account without her on it. She can still give you your allowance using PayPal or Venmo.

Just imagine how much she'll freak out if she sees you spending money on more interesting things like vapes, Only Fans, or hotel rooms.
Don‚Äôt worry, some people got out at the 10th floor, we heading up to floor 72

I don‚Äôt have to beat anything.

My goals in life are different then the goals at the S&P.
It is extremely patriotic to go into BB & GME at the same time
There‚Äôs so much upside here. I‚Äôm buying leaps and shares and holding all year
I think about this too.  It's hard to time the entry into a value stock (or any stock in general) so I've added some momentum analysis to my stock picking analysis.   Momentum investing has been shown to be a strategy that has beaten the market. ([https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/momentum/](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/momentum/))  Waiting years for a value stock to pop seems to be putting money on the table that could have been used in buying other good companies where the market has begun to recognize their value.  Thus, if an undervalued company has stayed undervalued with little price movement in the last six months to a year, I just put it on the backburner and come back to it later.  There has to be upward momentum in the last three months before I pull the trigger and buy a value stock.  This is not sure fire way, but it has helped me to avoid undervalued stocks that have stayed in the doldrums for years.  A little over a year ago, I purchased $DIS at $151 after a recent uptrend in Oct - Nov of 2019.  It took a year where the stock didn't do so well due to COVID, but it eventually popped starting in November of last year as the vaccine got released.  I think it would have gone up faster if not for COVID.

I do have one exception to the rule.  My exception to the above rule is when I see a stock quickly decline (e.g., evidence of fear), and I may buy it on a pure price reasoning when there is no upward momentum.  Most recently, I did that with $GM at $25.84 a share.
I got 1000% off some GM 44.5 calls this week. The market is nuts.
It‚Äôs over 9000!!!!!
Atvk will go up tomorrow for sure, probably in the final hour.

Try to buy a dip if there is one, this stock gets attacked with fake news tweets all the time, buy those dips.

I think shares are when you share your wife. Or your mom.
Unemployment rates here in EU aren't that high, but a whole portion of the economy is being bankrolled on government dime. Quite frankly it's a sight to see, since we've been almost beaten to death by austerity proponents less than 8 years ago. Times, they are-a-changin'.
That Biden economic plan looks far too ambitious and costly. No way it passes even in a dem majority senate?

UVXY closes at 10.01 on 01/22. 

You're down 31$ in shares. You're down 58$ on the Put. You're up 70$ on the Call. Net loss of 19$.

That's the worst case scenario and I think it's far more statistically probable than you'd consider at first glance.
lmao what is old is new again
Come up with a price target you are happy at in 1/3rds, sell 1/3 at the price you are content with, 1/3 at the price you hoped for, and 1/3 at the price you can brag about.

Lol what? The case for energy to suddenly become a massively high margin industry is really fucking retarded. Tesla has a margin and earnings problem, not a growth problem.

Tesla insurance will be puny at best. Probably ultimately will partner with a real insurance company because that'll be much much much cheaper. Insurance is also...as you might have guessed...a hyper competitive and also very low margin industry.
Help. I want to buy a call in BB. What would be a good starting point?

I just checked my TD account. Next to my shares it says: "Fitbit Inc. CSH MRG @ 7.35/sh 1/14/21" So it sounds like it will be paying out the 7.35/share. Hopefully that lands in my account tomorrow.

Shh. I'm selling these for AMAZING premiums.

If you're talking about GME, the implied volatility on the calls (currently 260-300% as I'm looking at them) is too high to make good profit, unless the price just goes absolutely through the roof. Shares are the move for GME right now. If you just asking in general, calls are potentially more profitable than shares, but without the inherent value of shares.
Literally ever platform has done this to Trump. Not quite sure why twitter is taking the big hit for it lol

Wow thank you for all the feedback, saving this!

1. I agree that it should work this way. I need to find a good way to toggle between syncing them and not. It's hard to not keep cluttering up the UI.

2. Going to add Vol and OI to the menu soon

3. This is definitely a bug, that shouldn't happen.

4. I didn't think anyone would need more than 2 expirations but I am learning I was wrong, I hope to fix this eventually.

5. This is how all calculators I've seen do it. It can be a little unexepected but the reason is the expiration price of the first expiration is unknown. Essentially there is an infinite number of sub-charts that could be generated depending on where it expires at. For example, if your first call expires at $350 and then the underlying goes to $320 a week later, is different than if it expires at $340 and then goes to $320. My upcoming solution for this is to maybe be able to hover over the prices on the first expiration, and expand the chart based on what expiration price you selected. This will take a while to get done though.

6. I like this idea too. I was thinking maybe a range slider (with a start and end) to select what range it goes around. Then the problem is that most people just want to expand the entire range so they have to drag two things now. A lot of issues fall into this category because don't want to make the UI too crowded to support all these use cases. I'll keep thinking of the best solution.
next week please be pltr week
interesting, so if u think this is not the squeeze, how will you make the determination when the squeeze has begun? Any particular metric?
Yo BB wtf I should have listened forgive me
And there goes those BB boosters. ARE YOOOOOOU READDDDYYYYYY!!!!!

I would if I had the $
1.) Congrats on making $100. It‚Äôs profit and no amount of profit should be minimized when your new. 
2.) If you‚Äôve been doing calls and puts/ day trading then stop. Right now. You have more then enough evidence in front of you, telling you day trading is not for you. 
3.) End the ‚Äúlottery ticket‚Äù mindset right now. Instead, Buy stocks/ETFs from reputable companies with good track records and history and THEN HOLD. For years not weeks. There are threads everyday on this very subreddit with excellent stock and ETF recommendations. Use them, use Motley Fool, Cathie Woods, Barrons and others with actual documented positive track records.
4.) New players Should Never try day trading until they have done serious time simply investing in stocks, learning to understand the market and doing the proper research. You could have simply bought an ETF and made way more money in the same amount of time. I‚Äôm not saying this to make you feel bad, but this was a rather easily avoided stepping stone. We‚Äôre in a bull market after all.
6.) stay away from YouTube guru‚Äôs. Out of the hundreds of people on that site there are only like 2-5 worth watching and none of them are right 100% of the time. The absolute rest are garbage, click-Bait morons, who are out only to make themselves money and no one else.

Yessir I‚Äôm going in
My experience has been exactly the opposite... I usually have 2 limit orders set on anything I'm actively trading. One below the current price that will buy the dip and lower my cost basis, and one above the current price that will take some profit. I'm happy with either scenario. The mid-day doldrums from 11:00 - 3:00 are when nothing good is usually happening for me.
BB is gonna love this. We are mooning AH
Train started today! Get on board!
Happy birthday you piece of shit. Congrats and fuck you on your gains
Holy shit those fucking retards. Nevermind the short cover is humungus, my bad. Still new to options. For initiating the squeeze, they would cover tomorrow I was thinking (unlikely), initiating a gamma in their favor whilst effectively covering at their absolute minimum before it moons. Also I just realized that it would take a long ass time for them cover instantly. A lot of those covers will have grown quite a bit.

1400 (600 + 1400) was clear from the beginning. Biden himself posted it a few days ago on twitter.
This, someone make a good meme, will get this shit started
Did you buy this AM?
I wanted to see it steady for a week or something before putting more in but here we are lol
hmm if you want to be safe id say stay with GME but ATVK can reach 1$ or maybe even more but its risky so up to you, Risk vs reward mate

0DTE Options Questions:

On spintwig, it looks like 0DTE / 30D / HTE short put strategies consistently beat the S&P 500 (and other short/put strategies):

[https://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-0-dte-leveraged-options-backtest/#Compound\_Annual\_Growth\_Rate-2](https://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-0-dte-leveraged-options-backtest/#Compound_Annual_Growth_Rate-2)

[https://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-0-7-and-45-dte-leveraged-options-backtest/#Compound\_Annual\_Growth\_Rate-2](https://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-0-7-and-45-dte-leveraged-options-backtest/#Compound_Annual_Growth_Rate-2)

Under methodology it says "Timing 3:46pm ET". Does that mean the backtest sells puts 14m before close? Is that better than selling a put at 9am ET and letting it expire at 4pm ET?

Anyone have experience running this strategy?
Im getting in Tommorrow.  Can we keep this under 10$ till then lol

Longed 5 /ES contracts , we about to rocket back to 3813
I‚Äôm pretty much going to disagree.  Anyone long the option is more likely to sell than exercise, although I‚Äôd guess there will be some held through to expiry, more than usual to capture any squeeze energy through to the last minute.  The MMs who sold to them will have already been hedged.  Essentially what I‚Äôm concerned about is that all this money will come out of GME derivatives as the big option positions expire, there will be an effect on the stock.  A week ago, it looked like the expiring options were net heavy on the put side, but I think we‚Äôve skewed back the other way in the last few days.  The past data was based on someone‚Äôs post where they dug into the open interest, and I‚Äôm definitely guessing on current oi.  Once all those hedged are unwound, that‚Äôs going to do something.

Whaaat? Are you telling me everything is propaganda? Like the way waves of cash roll into and out of sectors in a planned move? Pump it up. Slowly bleed it off, pump it some more. Let the bag holders pile in. Sell it all. Move to another downed stock. 


That would be manipulation and against the SEC regulations. That couldn‚Äôt *possibly* be happening.
Who knows. This is a good price to raise money at in any case. A higher price is better, but they have to be realistic. There's also a lot of buy demand. You want to do an offering while buy demand is setting in, not after it has set in. Otherwise, you crash the price.

you're a mad man! congrats!
What's crazy to me is that, with everyone expecting a squeeze, all options are almost the same price.  For example, a 1/22 30c isn't that much cheaper than March 30c.  Time is free, because everyone expects the squeeze tomorrow.

Welcome aboard!
MJ, CIIC, FDX, SSPK, ARKG, & STIC were all up pretty big today.

The MJ calls for $16 that I bought before the election expire tomorrow and are currently up 908%. If it's up tomorrow that will be my first 10-bagger. Unfortunately I only bought in for 10 contracts because my main plan was to exercise the contracts if they ended in the money.
You know damn well this idiot has also bought shares even though Melvin paid for this article! Or is he mad that he went to a prestige college and WSB is beating him?

I can feel that BDE through my screen.
Ah I thought the ones that sold them the calls must have had the shares to hedge. Then, when these calls would not be excersised, they would sell these shares again. But I hope you are right, gme shares are around 2/3 of my portfolio right now huehue, last few days made me a happy man already
A bullish morning doesn't mean a lot. A bullish close though indicates this stock can go a lot higher in my opinion.
I can make a list of names I saw on the first DD about this $TANH with all the sus awards. Seriously like 3 day old accounts talking out their ass. They don‚Äôt even hide it anymore, I can only imagine that he has like 10 screens up in his mothers basement. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve got 90 shares just cause in cause I‚Äôm wrong af and tonight‚Äôs Biden news pumps it up hard
Does he think money grows on trees?
If it goes to 100 then yes. Rather than making 3x gains you could make 10x gains
It's at 10.75 now. What have you retards done.
I can't think of anything more retarded to invest in than BB so count me in
Congrats on the tendies
$3k on BB in solidarity.
No clean energy spending in this bill?
I for one, am totally shocked, that given a complete majority control of the government, the Democrats would choose to pussy out and show good grace to the GOP with a limp dick stimulus rather than ramming whatever they wanted down the GOP‚Äôs throats. 

Y‚Äôknow, what the GOP did to them literally months ago. Remember how mad they pretended to be after the GOP shoved the new SCOTUS down the Dem‚Äôs throats a month before the election? 

SMH this is why Democrats lose all the fucking time. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Doesn‚Äôt matter how ‚Äúright‚Äù the Dems think they are if you won‚Äôt do what THEY themselves say they need to do to get what THEY want done. They could literally have 100% control of the government and still find some way to not get things done. Fucking hell

The market is up 32% in the last 8 months, how did you do this to yourself
enjoy your lavish new lifestyle
Lesson 2 is a great way of keeping a solid pace for a stock. ( if that makes sense) for example you have $300 to invest, you think that the stock will keep going up, ok then put in $100 at open and let that ride to wherever it goes( let‚Äôs say the stock was $3 at open you put in that $100 then, and if it hits 3.50) then go in with another $100 and so on.
I mean, for someone young with a high risk tolerance and not a lot of money 30% in a year isn‚Äôt crazy gains. I know this isn‚Äôt the best mindset.
WTF is BB?
Fuck, market just closed and I have to wait for my deposits to go through because I like where my other positions too much.

FUCK, LET ME ON THE ROCKET
A market maker will buy at a slight discount to intrinsic value (since its deep ITM) and simultaneously sell the shares short. It then exercises the call to cover the short, and keeps the discount as a profit.

It‚Äôs scraping up pennies, but it‚Äôs a risk less trade and done at super high volume. Market makers make money this way no matter what the stock price does.
I‚Äôm long on 8/9 strikes, 7.50s expiring tomorrow, and 8s expiring 1/29. I‚Äôm loaded up.
Oh man iTRADE is ass. I‚Äôm switched to IBKR
It has a dividend that will return later this year, if you're up 170% you probably locked in div at 10%, which is a great yield. I'd say take some profits at 2x and enjoy them, keep some in the tank

BB GANG
Newer to investing and just want some advice because I'm having this issue of being really undecided. I am starting off with a Robinhood account and right now I only have about 400 dollars in, and I just want something that grows and has potential to break big. I plan on putting about 200 dollars a paycheck into my account to do this and was thinking about putting it in stocks around 10 dollars a share. One I was looking at is BB and I guess my question is, since it's such a small amount of money I'm investing right now, is it better to dump it all into one stock, or diversify? I see a lot of talks about ARK ETF's, should I invest in one of those also? I'm definitely want to hop aboard the clean energy train and technology and I'm pretty well versed in that stuff so this is more of a question about how I should initially invest. I'd also like some of the stocks that you think would be good to invest in at this point.

Buy BB calls at open
Anyone in JSDA (Jones Soda?). I bought it as a joke since I love Jones Soda, but it's gone up like 100% in the past month. It's a literal penny stock, and they got a new CEO. I ended up picking up 5000 shares which makes up a really small amount of my portfolio. Maybe they'll turn it around with this new CEO?

I am in on this. BBBY and BB got options for both march 19. Love the B!
You'll have to look around for articles, but it seems as if right now the plan is going to wait till after the corona stimulus. Infrastructure budget will pass cause DEMS own everything, but it looks like it might be spring/summer. Not saying the stocks aren't going to rally strictly on knowing its coming though. Just if you have options it might be better to roll them out a bit in case the big jump comes in spring at the passing of the bill.

For somebody who hasn't been following this since 2019... What exactly was the ongoing motivation and vision into GME? I'm watching it run and I still don't understand the recovery it's made.
That's solid. 400 on top of you state unemployment is respectable.
10.51 afterhours ALREADY!
And Awomen
I dumped BB calls a month ago wtf is wrong with me
GME 50! DONT GET DISTRACTED FROM THE FREE MONEY!
Looks like FDs are the play sometimes. A few months ago we were all saying that leaps were the way. But nope, FDs really go gangbusters on things like BB.
Good question.   I wired myself 67k out of my account to my bank account.  Didn't lose it.  Was at 25k October 15 and now at 218k plus the 67k I wired out.

BB is INSANE
It‚Äôs up 1.3% after hours
While I don't disagree it's overbought, is it as overbought as tech? Everything is overbought right now, so it's really just the small caps turn to moon. Everything will correct eventually.

Closing the Jan call would involve putting more money on the table, not taking it off. I sold to open the Jan call.

I was aware of the earnings. I was intending to hold through earnings on the Feb call - I didn't expect the Jan call to be anywhere near the money so I was anticipating buying to close it for next to nothing prior to earnings.

With MT and other steel gang stocks its important to keep track of the steel index. If the index goes up, the sector stock follows. Yes this week has been relatively flat but if you were in since a few months back the trend has been a steady increase. This isn't a quick weekly play but monthly play and long hold. Ofc you do you.

Better to pay taxes on any gains than end up getting buttfucked into a tax refund.
Never said I was betting against anyone.

Cloud gaming is years away from technical viability. Fiber has to expand across the US before it has a chance.

No PC digital storefront can compete with Steam. Epic and GOG are the closest and they practically have to buy their customers away. The other players are the ones with IP on their platforms like Blizzard and EA.

Where does GME fit in from a technical perspective? Itll be interesting to see how Cohen plans to disrupt an a very well understood industry. It's pretty pointless to return a PC game digitally when people will just back up saves and then pirate single player games again.
I agree with the recommendation to reduce your size. You'll be better able to control your emotions if the trade goes against you. Then scale up as you gain confidence. Also, don't beat yourself up if you miss the first move. You've probably noticed that the top gainers each day tend to have more than one move.

You didnt?
its ok tho, tis just a drip in the bucket.
I feel not putting enough on a play you feel good about and selling too early, always feels worse than a loss. 

With a loss you can move on, with the other two you keep on calculating you hypothetical profits.
Sir, we're going to need you to step over here and get de-loused.
I think I'm gonna go with the $10 01/22 BB calls. Thoughts?
Awesome man.  This is the best thing to do.  Just don‚Äôt sell those til we‚Äôre on the other side of $60.

You‚Äôre high. They‚Äôre not doing any more half measures.
You hate it because you don't understand the current state.  The solar roof is on the 3rd generation and ramping up quickly.  Tesla is on a hiring spree around the country and will be growing the solar business dramatically.  This is just the start of the Tesla energy S-curve.  With huge solar installation comes WAY more Tesla energy storage grid level systems.  Another exponential and disruptive business.    

I'm sorry, but you're a straight up fool if you think any legacy auto maker has the same software chops as Tesla.   Tesla is literally rated the top choice for engineers to work.  Autonomy can't be solved with money and employees.  You need the top 20 smartest people in the world in a room, which Tesla can do.

I honestly think people are following us now and wanting to get in on next GME. Look at BBBY today as well which has been touted here for a while. Next up are the Steel stocks. Tons of stocks frequently mentioned here went way up today. Now is this a good or bad thing is tough to say. Obviously tendies now are amazing but what about when everyone is aware of our next moves. Soon there may be a whole segment on CNBC about WSB.

to be able to do that successfully through options, the stock would have to raise 75% higher than the option strike. Assuming they started shorting around 10.

For every options contract you want to exercise, you need to own 100 shares of said stock to back the ability to exercise it. If these are naked calls, he wouldn't already own the shares to exercise so he'd need to purchase them first. Or something like that. Fuck IDK.

I'm pretty fucking stupid so take it with a shaker of salt.

Idk I grabbed 3c just because the price was so fucking low that I figured I‚Äôd get near guaranteed profits with great upside, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people go 10c, the prices are so good you can just decide where you want to go in terms of risk reward.

This is by far the best EV play rn! Chart looks incredibly primed for a reversal and I expect a major breakthrough tomorrow! Personally expecting $24 min EOW this week! The fact that the price dipped to the 21 day EMA today is insane, such a great buying opp. Highly recommend people buy shares before the Stimulus announcement in a few hours! This is going to boom tomorrow!

A lot of this is probably reactive, but social media companies have really gotten themselves into a fight with no good outcomes regarding free speech, and their control of it (exactly what the Founding Fathers intended...the government can't limit free speech but a handful of billionaires who own the principle platforms for free speech can). Even Jack Dorsey came out acknowledging this is a problem, while still wanly defending the Trump ban. My equally wan defense of these social media companies is that they are kind of painted into a corner by being bombarded about stopping that disinformation that has not first been cleared by official gatekeepers, putting them in a position where they are under a lot of pressure to act, at the same time that doing so butts up against basic American values. From an investment perspective this doesn't seem to be a good place to be, and personally I have exited the modest social media positions (Twitter and Facebook) that I had.

I plan to trade with a larger account of like 5k very soon. With that account I will take few positions. I know I can grow it over time with compounding profits and deposits. I will not want to put this account much at risk if I hope to grow it to 100k.

But at the same rate I‚Äôm fine toning my skill set to trade larger scalping account of say $1k

Because of my options trading past it prepared me well to lose money and take risk. 

I‚Äôve lost a lot of money in options basically gambling. 

Pretty willing to do the same with forex but only small accounts because of how liquid it is. 

I wouldn‚Äôt want to run my larger account as my scalping account and will not.

But I‚Äôm just that kind of person I will not be happy until I got the badge of being able to grow small accounts to bigger ones.

You just can‚Äôt do that in 24-72 hours proper risk management. 

 I wouldn‚Äôt advocate to do the same unless you have two accounts. 

I‚Äôve taught the same for those trading stocks and want to learn options. I‚Äôve sold my stocks so many times to buy options is sickening so I trade different accounts so that I can do so!
Thank you for enlightening me!

These companies have highly inflated P/E ratios. I would not worry one bit about a drop in their market capacity.
Perhaps after a board meeting or in march when they report ( like they said they would do in December ).    Wonder if Cohen would reject it so the stock price stays on target...  they have plenty of money.

Australis capital is only at a market cap of about $70M and is easily worth $500m by year end in my opinion.
Side note, definitely still feels like 2020. Not much has changed and it's all a blur of awkward holidays and events.
I put my entire net worth into this 6509 and I'm not getting out before 100.

My best tip would be to have a trading journal to track every trade you make. And then monthly or quarterly go back and analyze which trades worked and which didn‚Äôt, and why. This is how I‚Äôve improved
Im sorry but I dont understand WSB GME thing. What the fuck does gamestop have to offer? Nobody buys hardcopies of video games anymore. Yall are buying calls on Blockbuster and making money can someone more autistic than me explain the deal here?
It‚Äôll come to about the same profit you‚Äôre fine
In the 10s already so you're going to make some serious cash! All I have's 5 3/19 $10 calls.
Me too; I feel you. I rarely even buy FDs, but still have solid gains. Wsb is just too good not to follow. Feeling like a boomer over here, though
he feels it's easier to scroll through a single thread instead of opening up a thread to see the content every time something seems interesting.

Part of this is going to depend on how you view reddit, as well.  I believe new reddit lets you see a few sentences of the OP on each thread like an email preview, which can facilitate scrolling through a lot of threads without any additional effort; people like me who are either still on old.reddit or have some style plugins, or use third party apps and don't have the thread's summary displayed w/ the title, find the daily format significantly easier since there's no need to click in to see discussion.  There's strengths and weaknesses to both method.
I've know nothing about options.  Can you ELI5 what $9 2/19c means?  Only thing I know is that the contract expires on 2/19?

Which calls did you buy?
114$ per share.  I arrived at this valuation by searching for CHWY in my robinhood game and typing that number here.
Imma buy ArkX because Cathie works for the regular  joe.
Historically, its really jolted the market in a good way.  While this is a democratic imposed stimulus (possibly less direct support for companies) even getting cash to consumer will end up with companies to begin with.

The Market has historically generally responded well by given the populous a ton of checks.  No one just drops this into bank accounts, its spent.

I want this to be Biden's speech tonight: 

'We are unveiling a $10T stimulus for every American AND Canadian (I am Canadian) where they receive $5000 each.

The rest of the money will be for EVs, Clean Energy, all the disrupters that ARK invests in, and GME, caught burn those shorts that's why'

You should feel great. Its at a discount
There were talks of a $2000 check instead of the $600 which is what was proposed by both Trump and House Dems but wasn‚Äôt even introduced in the senate since Mitch McTurtle said no. So, most people got a $600 check instead. The difference ($1400) is what will be discussed in his speech today. Hope this helps clarify.
I will ask my mum üòÅüöÄ
not OP. 

how does a call convert to profit? 

If the price is $8 today and $12 in March, with $10 call you can basically 
purchase stock at $2 discount? So you buy the stocks and then sell them for profit?
Here‚Äôs the thing, the short squeeze hasn‚Äôt even started yet.

Interesting.  I've never heard of pensions where they don't require the employee to contribute anything.  Is this a gov't or private employer?
Wait, are you talking European or American options? I am thinking American.
With the new stimmy incoming and possible sector rotation out of tech, take some gains out of tech and go balls deep in IWM calls. Thank me later with a ride in your lambo

Jesus BB I remember in December when we were all hoping for you to hit 9 or maybe 10 EOM, Fucking steaming past them now
Assuming he sells
Nickel is needed for EV so easily past $20
this push is due to FB whatsapp security concerns, BB has BBM
D,uh, why not rates are so low... What Im surprised is so many refinancing banks are willing to refi at such low rates, when rates inevitably climb and their stuck holding fixed low rates...won't that affect their balance sheet negatively..
I have the 1/15 $9 calls left and some 2/5 $8 calls. Had a bunch of 1/15 $8 calls too but I sold them all today.
Sure, but everything that works looks genius in retrospect. Would you dump $100k into AMC 1/2022 calls right now? Because that‚Äôs basically what the OP did. Shitty company with sub-$5 stock price, etc. 

People have been blowing money on GME for years expecting the past two days to happen, how come now one talks about those people? We all know why, because we live vicariously through posts like this. The truth is, this is just a winning lotto ticket. That‚Äôs all.
Never ever sell your entire portfolio, especially companies you have high conviction in. Sure, if you want to take half out maybe that's okay, but how would you feel if markets go higher in 2021 and you missed all the gains?
My best days were shorting tsla.  Hell I made 40k last week shorting tsla even when tsla had its best week in some time.

I grew my account x14 going all in on tsla and gme calls this week and last week
Sitting in 40,000 shares in my main account, and roughly 4500 in two other accounts.  20,000 of my shares have calls written against them expiring tomorrow, at $36.  And I sold 1550 shares at $38.50 right at the top of the spike yesterday.  I'm sorta debating what to do with the calls.  $36 was the top of my adjusted, readjusted, readjusted price target.  First I was at $21, then $24.  Then when we hit $22.50 the second time and there were few big sellers, I made it $32.  And I wrote CCs against it at $36.  I wrote those when it was near $28, and only got $1.80 in premium.  So.
Only thing I ever see on the shelves at a local bass pro is fucking bb pellets, some fancy ass shotgun ammo and like a box of 22 shot shells.  I think the only rifle round Ive seen in the past 4-6 months is some 6.5 creedmoor.

Sold my PLUG 1/15 $60 calls early Monday for a loss before the jump. Sold my BB 2/19 $10 calls yesterday (literally no idea why). Bought only 5 GME 1/15 $25 calls Wednesday and panic sold 3 yesterday on a dip. After all that, I'm still almost up 200% on the month. Learn from your mistakes.

> Regulation requires control of the controller and since no one controls btc (except maybe the semi-obvious 51%+ mining share China holds) there's no way to regulate it outside of record keeping for users within the states.


Isn't the 'controller' the exchanges? Im not super familiar with crypto, but there has to be an intermediary between two people exchanging coins, correct? 

Couldn't they just force exchanges to follow similar laws as banks as far as identifying an entity or person as an account holder?

Aw yes thanks really this sub is great for learning quickly

The borrow rate is a floating one; it can change throughout the day up to 2 p.m. ET. Rates fluctuate based on the security‚Äôs market value, demand, and available inventory. If fees increase beyond the amount you‚Äôre willing to pay, all you will have to do is buy to close your short position before 5:30 p.m. ET to avoid being charged. Once you enter a short position, you will find current rates by going to the¬†Positions¬†tab and hovering over the¬†R¬†icon.
i may have bought some.....  but it sounds like i shoudnt have ( unless everyone saying to not buy calls is only talking about weeklies ).
Guess I went too long haha. I have calls till Jan 22 at 10c

According to this [DD](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxdn4u/gme_very_likely_to_go_to_47_or_more_tomorrow_480/), the volume is 70k as of now. No idea how its grown but id say at the very least is the market and not them. Either way I realized the short position itself is humungus nevermind. Just realized why deepfuckingvalue is a genius, or perhaps the shorts are retarded. In their defense tho, the RC gang pull up was probs not on their radar.

If you believe in the short squeeze thesis as presented above, then yes, you would do exactly as you described.

In order to avoid bankruptcy the short sellers will have to buy buy buy in order to close out these positions. If you buy and hold shares as you suggested, not only will the value of your shares increase, but that takes available shares off the market, making it harder for the short sellers to close their positions, and squeezing the price even higher than before.

That's why everyone here keeps saying üíé‚úã . Buy and hold no matter what, and the overextended short sellers become ever more overextended.
Because that obviously wouldn't lead to massive inequality. Bitcoins are a finite resource, almost all of which has already been mined. Without regulation it would never happen.
Inshallah
Yep, I'm half chinese and my mum gives me crap for even considering investing in Chinese markets. Stay away!
Yeah I'm up 30% for the past month and 90% for the three month, so I'm definitely not patting myself on the back for paying my broker to get me my 7%. I just like the tactile feeling of moving hundreds of shares around and for some reason I can just never get anyone to buy my damned options when I do hit it big with them. I think it's something to do with volume, but I didn't learn that until losing like 500 bucks on calls that no one wanted to buy.

Yeah just do good research before you begin and only invest in what you really believe has the potential to grow in the future. I just started investing like a week ago and have shares in 4 etf‚Äôs and 1 individual company that I really feel has the potential to grow within the next 5 years due to some research.

Insurance is only hypercompetitive against the current iteration of insurance.  But if you're honest the current iteration of insurance if fucking RETARDED!  Working with insurance companies is a horrendous user experience.  With Tesla you'll be able to hop in the car and confirm your insurance.  It'll track your movement and price you accordingly and fairly.  It's a bigger opportunity than you realize if they get a large enough take rate.  

The solar roof is on the 3rd generation and ramping up quickly. Tesla is on a hiring spree around the country and will be growing the solar business dramatically. This is just the start of the Tesla energy S-curve. With huge solar installation comes WAY more Tesla energy storage grid level systems. Another exponential and disruptive business.

I have a feeling my Apple 1/29 130c will depreciate tomorrow üòî
So my total profit rn is 1.8k. So ur saying take like half of it. And leave rest shares in? And not buy more right?
It‚Äôll keep going up you might just have to sit on it
One thing to consider is the tax liability on long-term vs short-term gains.

If you can hold out until one-year after you made these purchases, your taxes on any gains will be much lower.

what do people do when they make more money? Pay more taxes, spend more money...
Ok boomer

I actually only put in 1,500 on those calls all around. I‚Äôm already up 4k.
Right. So after hours is an indication of where it‚Äôll be tomorrow at market open? It closed at 9.11 

In my instance I‚Äôm looking at OTM calls, LEAPS I guess   I want to take whatever I can on my way to the expiration date. This basically my first option purchase and I‚Äôve been waiting to find the right entrance and exit strategy

Lol. You read about reddit and decided to dive in. Learn to do your OWN DUE DILIGENCE. Most people are out here to make money. If that means its at your expense, thats fine with them.
If it‚Äôs the new GME might need to hop on. Sell my SPCE üßê

Given the current volume i'll say options are a better bet. The premium is till not too high.
ARkG casually hitting ATH during AH lol
GME wow just crushed 40 into 41 AH
When watching years of your salary appear and disappear on a daily (sometimes hourly) basis... giving yourself a cavalier attitude can help preserve your sanity and your ability to think clearly. It helps some people to avoid becoming emotional and making stupid emotional decisions.
I think unless you have the highest level of options, you can only sell cash secured puts. Which means you need the capital to potentially buy 100 shares x (# contracts) @ strike price

Lmfao that‚Äôs a better position than I have. You‚Äôre going to be golden, boy.
you need to sell while momentum is high, the stock is still moving higher just before it reaches the top of the day. When that happens, I can't tell you. 

So sell at higher price while the stock is rapidly going higher, exactly before it slows down. Theres no magic answer, sorry.
Lookin thick. Solid. Tight. Keep us updated bros
That just means you have more time to load up rn
same I can‚Äôt find It either
We all got hit this week. Going to be interesting tomorrow who takes profits if we move.
If youre serious about trading read "Trading in the Zone" by Mark Douglas. On my 2nd time now and its changed the way I trade forever. What you just explained will be fixed.
I coulda been you if I wasn‚Äôt a retard and blew up my account on Tesla

Woah here we go GME! A little AH tenditown
See if you can get portfolio margin now that you're over 100k. It's amazing, esp if you want to make theta plays sometimes.

Great insight. I appreciate your response. Law school and options are certainly different, but they don't have to be mutually exclusive. I'm quite interested in learning about securities law which would go hand in hand with investing.
Hold on you paper handed bitch.
HERE‚Äôs hoping stimmy news will give a nice bump across the board.  Maybe more in the most immediately affected markets.  ANNOUNCE A GREEN ENERGY PLAN SO MY GREEN SHARES GO üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I‚Äôd be fine with that as I‚Äôm holding shares and a Few calls. Just remember that IV is crazy high right now so theta is gonna eat your ass if there‚Äôs not a huge downswing. Good luck.
Anyone knows more about the infrastrcture plan? Who are the supposed big winners there? X, MT i assume, but what else?

Damn was short on cash and only got 8 $7c expiring 3/19. Already up but greedily want more and will buy some next payday
Should have bought more APHA instead of this useless fuckin BIOL
Yeah cause you're the only one who's going to sell "once QE eases up" or "fed increases interest rates" and you're definitely going to be one of the first movers to pull out....

This is called timing the market. And you will not beat institutional investors at timing that moment.
damn i‚Äôm sad tomorrow‚Äôs friday , this week has been pretty exciting lol
I think you mean Sir Jack a Lot - he‚Äôs always playing all in recently bought CRSR
proof!
Probably. But only saying that because I have 50x 3/19 8c I sold last week after weeks of slow grind downwards
Last post  is BB gonna moon tmr that‚Äôs all I care about
Crazy thing about BB rn is that we have no idea why they are running so hard.
Lmao GME gapping up
$1400 payments going to shove Tesla up to a new level of autistic....

GME FINALLY GREEN AH, MOON MISSION TOMMOROW CONFIRMED BOIS üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
What are you tards talking about he sold his 20c for 1.5M in cash? He share position is same as yesterday?
I've made a lot of good money along the way, but i'm just saying i've never been in something that the whole sub is backing. I have around $150k, from swinging positions with shares. Gains is gains, but it feels like i'm missing out on the fun lol
My portfolio went up almost 100% as well. I have been looking for reasons not to cash out (see my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kogn47/when_to_cash_out_from_this_craziness/)).

So what I decided is that I'm going to put about half of my money in something long term/low risk like mutual fund or apple. The other half will go into something high risk like Tesla or NIO.
That‚Äôs 1% in 2030. Strangely they‚Äôre already priced like they‚Äôre producing over 50% of all cars today since that‚Äôs how much the 10 largest car makers produce together.

yea nothing for ICLN on first read. i have 15 jan 35c which will go 0. there is another infrastructure plan for feb. good think i have april calls. probably a good buy opportunity tomorrow.
That would be a really bad day.
What‚Äôs your twitch
Aint too late though, strap on and get it solider!üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I've had massive success with buying long calls of $IWM. It is the Russ2K index and is outperforming recently the S&P. Small caps are where it's at especially in the blue wave

S&P - 1Mo - 3.85% / 3Mo - 7.93% / 12 Mo - 18.5%

R2K - 1Mo - 11.36% / 3Mo - 29.83% / 12 Mo - 30%
These are the type of brainless fucks who ramped the short volume over the shares outstanding in the first place.
Hehe, 15 @ 4.79. $500+ profit right now doesn't suck. God I wish I had bought more.
lol, i meant our names. i'm megatron and you're optimus.  make money gang!
He‚Äôs the reason I bought GME calls last week lol
Godspeed friend. IV is too high for me so I'm share gang but I hope you get your tendies
Don‚Äôt sell GME until Melvin Capital declares bankruptcy
Just saw some of the BB DD looks interesting
All the way in but also wanna know in case it goes tits up
Oh man the bitterness and self loathing for GME paper hands and doubters  is going to be glorious
I'm sad because I wanted to aquire more shares under 20 bucks.
Damn did Biden mention GME, wtf AH
investing and gambling are not the same
i scrolled directly to the bottom for positions. not even there.
Yeah send me your money and I‚Äôll do it for you .
Well for just one payment of $9.99 followed by a monthly payment of $99.99 you can read my ghost written book ‚ÄòHow the rocket went to the moon‚Äô. 

Jokes. Start of easy reading up on all the terminology. Market cap. Float. Cash runway. Beta. 

Then see what areas the main funds are investing in and which stand to benefit from big trends. Check out Biden‚Äôs economic plan for example. 

Find a company that isn‚Äôt a total joke and that has a product that is either cheaper or better than the competition. Take a small stake and if it starts to move consider investing more.
I‚Äôm poor and had one 7$ call I bought last week for 44$ and sold for 264$. I wish I had the diamond hands of u/DeepFuckingValue

Can we trade 1 BB for 1 SPCE
I think GM will sell the Most EV's. 2nd will be Volkswagen. 3rd Tesla.  4th (To be determine from China )

Reason is just GM and Volkswagen (cheaper cars and more variety). 

Tesla probably selling Batteries. Subscription based FSD. Maybe Tesla FSD in all ev's. There are different revenue streams. Tesla Charging stations allowing secondary companies for charging.  Tesla with a StarLink, living in cars pretty soon. mobile home 2.0.

Tesla right now should just buy up all these EV's companies in different sectors. 

Might as up buy up an EV Bus and buy up Ford and create a Model T lmao. Maybe comes antitrust in 10 years lmao. I'll buy up Ford, it's going die anyway. 

Tesla right now is like IBM in the 70's, total domination in almost all aspect of EV technology, but mistakes can happen who knows. 

By 2030, we'll only have 5 major EV companies. Tesla is one them. 

so 2022-2023, Tesla worth more than Apple.
They could have held the olympics last summer if they just had a bubble which they always have anyways.

Good DD I‚Äôm in
Not a lot for ICLN in stimmy news I'm afraid, but my Jan 2022 calls are waiting patiently
It seems like a lot of us making Monday today! I see 3 big winners: GME, BB, and Pot stocks.

I‚Äôm holding a ton of TLRY calls myself, up a hefty amount today. Which side of the gains are you on?! Any others?!

Let‚Äôs gooo üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Clean energy and federal decriminalization are coming.  Tonight Uncle Joe is Stimmy & vaccine.
Y'all should have hopped on the TLRY train. Shit made more sense than GME, got in at $9.
Too much work man it's gotta go
Bought SQ at $25 and SHOP at $100. Still holding.
Brokers and market-makers love this kind of trade because there's not much delta, the spread is wide, and they can charge commission on each leg. I have only once been unable to trade a butterfly as a strategy (ie all three legs at the same time). I wouldn't generally worry about liquidity with something like this.
SPY opens at $380 tomorrow, fite me!!!
Day trading options is way less stressful than holding options. I can easily ride momentum for an hour rather than guess the future.
So we buy nok next
I feel like poking it with stick to see if it‚Äôs alive. I‚Äôve been patiently waiting for this stock pump with the catalysts coming up.
Ofc
GTFOH with this shii
This is how i see it. Even if GME falls 20% tomorrow, i still see GME as a 5x investment in a year or so. Just look at their revenue and new management to go e commerce. This is grossly undervalued. I have about 20k worth of shares rn.
Oh so is Twitter next, then? Asking for a friend.

Covered calls are literally cancer

Sold GOEV 19c when the stock was 16/share, the stock gapped up overnight to 20$, where I could have unloaded my bags for a small profit if I wasn't bound by the call. And of course the stock has since retreated back down (expiry tomorrow)

Sold BB 9c expiring tomorrow for fucking lunch money AND THE FUCKING STOCK GAPS UP 50% 

what kind of fucking autism do I have

Everyone has fun until the music stops and you're left standing.

Ultimately dividends is the primary way that companies return profits to their owners, if a company isn't paying dividends, then you have no returns beyond what you'd get from owning any other useless token.

I‚Äôm glad I held GME after close
Bidet actually is a rapist though. His staffer Tara Reade #metoo Ed him. He almost had to drop out after video of him molesting kids and her credible accusations shook up the race.
This has been market correction to closer to actual direct value, future value no where close to being priced in.  Moass still on the horizon, possible for sure.  Long term value or squeeze, nothing but upside.
the GME bag is gonna be fucken massive
Those picks are definitely not pure value or dividend stocks.

Apple, Microsoft and Facebook were pure growth stocks 5-10 years ago and can now be considered Quality Businesses with surprisingly high growth. 5-10 years ago these stocks where considered pure risk and didn‚Äôt pay out any dividend until more recently.

Anyway I think a mix between different sectors and stock factors is healthy and we shouldn‚Äôt be to dogmatic by only picking value, dividends or growth.
Looking like another 30% day for GME tomorrow?
This sounds american as fuck, especially the health care part. To the moon.üöÄüöÄüöÄ I bought BB before earnings and now I have my money back. ü§î
Yes and no on bonds. Yes in that the textbook answer is that you should, both no in that interest rates can't really go lower and bond prices will fall in the future. Perhaps you could diversify another way, like a REIT or dividend sticks.
where bro
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp


A covered call refers to a financial transaction in which the investor selling call options owns an equivalent amount of the underlying security. To execute this an investor holding a long position in an asset then writes (sells) call options on that same asset to generate an income stream.
I would say don‚Äôt overtrade. In the beginning I was selling my winners way to early and didn‚Äôt have stop losses in place for my losers. My winners were on average +6% and my losers were -10%. In the past 2 months I‚Äôve flipped that to +12% and -4%.

He misquoted WSB to say the least... ‚Äútraders don‚Äôt care all about the valuation‚Äù is about as wrong as it gets.  I can honestly say that most of the DD‚Äôs I see/read on here are ALL about value.- how it‚Äôs u set valued, why it‚Äôs undervalued, and why it will correct.

This shot should be redacted.  Seriously
That's in a separate plan that'll be announced next month

‚ÄúThe trick is to flick your finger across the screen with your watch list open. Touch the screen when your poop hits the water, and the ticker you touch is your trade for the day. Pro tip: only have TSLA on your watchlist.‚Äù

and what was the difference to BB? How did u differentiate this and BB?
You try going back to your last checkpoint?
Told you so
I bet they still bootstraps you lol
Just pick your options, enter the price you paid for them. Then in the graph range set it tight so it shows smaller increments like from 9.5 to 11.
GME AH?!?!?
..........
Don't hate buy calls!
GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Yep idk who is feeding them this info. I have bundles of ICLN calls too and not thinking it will be mentioned once. Read a fucking Bloomberg article for me one time
Yes. But also no.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO GME WHAT LOL
I swear.
GME soaring
Another $2k??
Check DFV post history one of them he reveals himself as rk pretty much . I think it was about a month ago
I do my trading in my tfsa - sounds like if we were to get audited, worst case scenario is it would be treated like a personal account so nothing to lose.
Thought GME was going to be the same shit as today. Sold 44c to rebuy tomorrow after AM dip to Let me 39 0dtes run free again if volume looks good
Premiums are high, sell contracts
42 already ü•µ
100% or nothing. got to make up for Monday close
some autist on here already did something exactly like that and made some shitty amazon book and was shilling it for like a month

No. That was Melvins doing about 1-2 months ago
Holy fucking shit, this is literally me calculating how fucked my $40 calls expiring Friday were.
Certified dumbass here but I will try to help.

For an options contract you will need to pay the premium. In this case the BB calls are $113 for ONE contract which controls 100 shares.

TMR if the premium rises to 1.23 from 1.13 (113 to 123) and you sell the contract you will get $123. Either way you lose the premium money. It's a matter of making enough money to cover the premium.
GME AH taking off!!!
Same throwing $3500 at it wish I was a day earlier
Is there any news on GME right now or just more squeezage?
Holding because almost all of my portfolio is on it, I could liquidate ICLN and BABA to buy more BB but holding for now
Why is it going to after hours. Can you please explain this to a fellow noob
May as well milk this market for all it's worth.
He could be Melvin too. He's publicly short but actually long (af) lol
I never said a legacy is or will be better than tesla, werr just talking about the market tesla is in, if my town has one bakery I have 100% market share but that dosent mean I'm worth a billion dollars l, tesla is an awesome company but it is not worth 880 billion dollars it is worth as much as the whole auto industry, I give it no higher than what it is based on math, people predicted dot com with math and facts, and please,please never bring up cathie wood, if you really think tesla will be larger than the jdp of the Japanese economy than fine, but understand that your price target are from someone trying to pump their own holdings saying one company is worth more than all of japan, I mean just think about it.

make sure you don't have any open limit sell orders for GME shares either that would take you below 100 shares.
If GME wanted to gap up to $60 tomorrow, I wouldn't be mad
Been watching ABCL but the subborn fucker doesn‚Äôt want to drop to ~$30ish so I can buy in

That 50k was a small part of his portfolio. Amazing gains of course but it‚Äôs easier to hold if you have 350 other stocks in your portfolio.
Well this certainly ticks all the YOLO boxes. Best of luck to you sir
Reminder, even with the huge gain today BB is very undervalued when you look at their p/e and market cap. And no one has begun to price in their future potential.

Too many boonerdt and wall street guys think of them as a dead phone company. Use their ignorance to your advantage and make $$$$

Three is still time, until shorts cover this aint the finish line.
I will wet myself
Exactly, I just don‚Äôt know where to project it, it‚Äôs undervalued because it transitioned from a dead company into an entirely new market, I think leaps are the way to go because it‚Äôs hard to say when the general public will realize that it‚Äôs an entirely new company and undervalued
Fuck buying leaps. Have had pltr leaps for ever. Weeklies or lose it all. This is the fuckimg way
i feel attacked
Comment saved. Will do if I remember haha. Thanks!
Should've went further out for more callllllls. Need dem lotto TIX
Thanks. Any idea what time it starts?
I made several hundred off that post lol
yeah, gonna want to pay that quarterly, otherwise tax bill is a few million and that comes with a fuckload of penalties
Biden just announced a 1.8 trillion dollar stimmy with $1400 checks for everyone. We on a moon mission.
Thanks!

> In reality it would have been far more of unrealized gains when you factor in the price of those options at the time.

By this do you just mean that he could have instead invested the $7,260 elsewhere?
That's called luck my dude. You were lucky. Have a little humility.
I bought 20 1/15 40c for $3 per if this shit hits 50 tomorrow I‚Äôm 10k richer

Can you explain ‚Äúit‚Äôs a wrap?‚Äù As in it will break out and move higher?
Probably an expensive hedge for someone massively short in case they get squeezed some more...
whats the beef with Citi?  been on here for a while now and this is the second time i have seen something about this...
BB on a moon mission
Don't ask if it's worth going in, when BB is under 20$. This is massively undervalued.
Oh, I know the answer to that
Kudos on your success and for planning to teach your niece and nephews about personal finance.  Your guidance can be life-changing for them.  That will be the biggest gift you can give them.
The .5c July calls are .48. Anything above 1$ and you‚Äôre free money. It‚Äôs guaranteed above 1$ for 30 days. I‚Äôm retarded but seemed free $ think  play.
well BB is a real company who makes a profit and has a good outlook so... no I would say if you're in it for the long haul then go for it
GME ABOVE $41.  The rocket is refuelled.  Pluto confirmed.
Hey brosef, back in your cash account, could you day trade everyday with the full balance or was there a delay.  For example, say you had 10k and went all in on the morning. The sold in the afternoon. Would the 10k be available next morning?

What you mean XOM blew the shit out of pltr today. At this point pltr just needs to change its name to msft it just sits there.

"So glad I invested thousands of dollars in GameStop" is sure as shit a phrase I never though I'd say out loud.
Congratulations. We will watch your career with great interest
At least the castration was successful
40k into 2.7 mils in the second trade alone - most of us have the 40k, but not the balls. Hail to the king of big balls.
Threw a couple grand at a GME 1/15 45c FD for the fuck of it cause I'm tired of missing out on the fun.
I only got 2 at 10am wish I woulda cashed out on these
That‚Äôs normal. And it will cost you money to learn what to do :) first you will try to get the max out of your investment, and it will correct some and you will sell because you are scared it will go lower, then it will bounce back lol. It‚Äôs the name of the game. Just accept you cannot buy the lowest dip and sell the highest peak. Set goals and if you reach them, be happy.

What I do to make it easier, if I sell a position, I erase the share from my watchlist üòâ

Two days ago a sold a position which I bought at 9, and was planning to sell around 14. I sold a 11, because I assume the new position is gonna deliver me a higher return in the same amount t of time then the initial position will go from 11 to 14.
I can be wrong, but I took 20% profit, and that‚Äôs ok. I expect a profit in time on the new position.
First thing I did was erase the initial position from my watchlist. I have 20%, I don‚Äôt want to know IF I could had more or not. You know why? If I know, it will effect my future decisions based on an emotional factor, which is the stupidest thing you can do in investing. 

Good luck with your investments mate ;)
AH = low volume = easy squeezy lemon retard
GME FUCK IM HARDüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Dude, I'm just a retard. I think the real squeeze will start next week.

1. At what age do you want Financial Freedom

2. What age you want to retire and stop working and live off passive income

3. How much income would you like at age 50 if you retire early
Very nice win!   Had me checking my leaps real quick, haha.  Up 26% today.  Yumyum.

Holding until the real squeeze begins.
After hours is an indication where the stock will be tomorrow but it can also go up or down pre market.  There‚Äôs no way to tell, it‚Äôs just a gamble.

I was told that he was going to receive a blowie behind Wendy's and while passing a Gamestop a freak power outage left only Gamestop lit up, he knew it was a sign from the gods and quickly dumped his $5 into Robinhood.

I only bought $9c 1/22 at open this morning when it was OTM because I saw someone's post about $BB here at 2 AM last night.  I hope you have the same luck soon!

this shit is so scary im diamond hands with $10k in calls
$BB to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Lol no I got what you were saying.
How long is this GME pump going to realistically go on for?
Would that apply if I bought a call say, today, at $20 (and exercised), and then sold the call for $21 tomorrow?
Maybe if Biden wasn‚Äôt becoming President next week. I think it‚Äôll be green after his speech tonight, but I may be wrong.
I love all you retards.  I listened finally and went all in on GME and BB earlier today üöÄ üöÄ

 sony makes some quality shit (headphones, gaming consoles), but honestly their phones are shit... It's like they can't keep up in that department.
I've been trying to get an answer to this in the general discussion thread, but nobody has filled me in.

What is the entity / situation that allows for higher calls?  Is it automatically triggered based on the price rising?
But it's not normal private companies looking to space for profits. SpaceX and Blue Origin are owned and funded by the 2 richest men on earth - #1 and #2. SpaceX do not make a profit - they have a single government contract with 1 government. It's been Musks toy for years now, same as a Bezos with Blue Origin. No doubt these companies are cool and doing groundbreaking stuff, but they aren't and probably won't for 20 years turn a profit. Space companies won't make a profit because there is nothing in space worth anything that is within our reach with current technologies. Only realistic and worthwhile projects are asteroid mining and space debris cleaning, both probably 20 years away. Why would any country want to build a moon or Mars base? Maybe to put a telescope or radiation equipment on it? No one would ever want to live there - moon's gravity is too low and Mars is a radioactive wasteland. 

And all of it at the whim of a single governments budget. Has anyone ever told you that "NASA was a PR company that also went to space"? NASAs budget wasn't cut because of Challenger, it was cut because space, as cool as it is, just isn't worth the money right now.

It‚Äôs not so much a class war as it is a global economy. Low skill workers in 1st world countries now compete against similarly skilled workers around the globe. Similarly high skill workers & business owners are able to leverage their abilities globally and sell to bigger markets.

Is E*TRADE correct that the total market cap is 107k..?
If I make 25k on one trade and then lose 25k in the next trade is it 22k in taxable gains or is it a wash. Assuming this is all within the same year. Asking for a friend.

That link above will display the yearly cars produced. They have started doing double shifts now (and that's got their monthly production to 7000 a month) with weekly being 1750 a month. So the current capacity would be 84 000 cars per year, with greater efficiency and possibly working longer hours they can gain another 30-40% of production over time. Which will put them at 100k cars per month. Furthermore, I read that this current facility can be expanded and JAC was working on that. I fully expect a new factory to be built (looks like they are doing that) to reach a 300k a year run rate for 2022, and China is notoriously quick at building factories. I think they can reach 125-150k with this factory alone utilizing double shifts, longer hours and a factory expansion. We should hear more about this in the next quarterly report, I don't like to speculate much.

Well numbers don't lie so no matter how you spin it AMD is extremely expensive and the growth is diluted for shareholders by issuing a lot of new shares and selling them on the market.

If you talk about AMDs revenue growth you should also point out how the shares get diluted every year so the year on hear growth does not represent the growth an AMD stock holder sees. 

Intel growth does not get diluted and Intel is much cheaper than AMD. With AMD you pay 130 times revenue AND your holdings get diluted for 5% minimum each year.

U right
That is BS especially if they have been holding long.     If you have held since the beginning of 2019 you have seen some nutty shit including basically the entire world against Tesla.    Massive amounts of FUD.   No one really getting what was happening  People who held through that have some pretty diamond hands.   The idea that they would sell now after holding through all that because of 25% pullback seems a little out there when they have been through much more severe volatility.    

There were many longs that held through the COVID crash back in March 2020.    That was a fall of of a peak of $177 a share in February to a low of $72 a share by mid march.   What is that almost 60% loss?   So you are saying that people that held long through 2018 (or earlier) and then up to today will sell if there is a 25% pull back.    Well i can tell you that in my case it won't happen.   I will just buy the dip and accumulate shares.    Until the fundamentals change, I hit my price target, or my belief in the company changes I will not sell.     This is true of many many other Tesla investors.  Now are there new people who won't be as long and will be apt to sell?  of course there are.  But I would be very careful here if you think those longs are so easily shaken.

I would say so. The taco bell news is only hours old. I think we will see more and more restaurants offering vegetarian options as more and more people consider cutting down on meat consumption. I'm not even a vegetarian but I've cut way back on how much meat I eat. I think we're going to see an uptick in vegetarianism in the future.

Oh shit GME just now.
I‚Äôm in
Jesus GME.  How?  Again?  Fine, I'm back in.
see you guys on pluto
It actually worked and ironically much better than today in the 50s, 60s.
What does puts have anything to do with it, it doesn‚Äôt actually affect the stock price
If you sell at open you will lose money if the price hasn‚Äôt changed. I usually don‚Äôt doubt my vibe and hope for a rocket ship or put a stop loss at like 50%
I can help.
Also if you were wondering expect Q4 results in March.
Bought in this morning and up big
As far as DD goes - Amyris has a platform that allows them to manufacture virtually any organic molecule from sugar. They have shown they can create successful consumer brands and capture a lot of the margin. Now they're getting big enough to get included in $ARKG and the like. Sky is the limit!

see...any news?? I SEE üöÄüöÄüöÄI BUY.
Just a few that I've been watching in awe in the past year:

* OSTK Overstock.com (Mar - Aug 2020)
* TUP Tupperware (since Mar 2020)
* NVAX Novavax (Jan - Aug 2020)
* NNOX Nano X Imaging (since Aug 2020)
* JMIA Jumia (since Mar 2020)
So ur saying i should grab calls at open?
I haven't traded at all since last Summer because I was focusing on my license exam, but I passed. What are the best things to get into? Obviously GME but I missed that train. I am thinking calls on AMD, thoughts?
Yup. Not even a single Republican will support this. And I am sure there are still few Democratic Senators who will oppose this.
Good bot
This is why you don‚Äôt learn to trade from youtubers. Read a book from an experienced and successful investor like Peter Lynch.

Also wanted to add was wanting to know if it's too late to hop on the APHA train at this point.
I am really wondering this as well. I also don‚Äôt understand GME. Now, 10 or 15 years ago?? I wouldn‚Äôt have been surprised that GME and BB we‚Äôre doing well. But now?? Whaaaaat the fuuuck

Viagra would make my dick softer. Thats how i am feeling.
im talking about debt wtf are you talking about
I have the option to buy 6600 shares for the premium of 10k because I have 66 contracts. Most people don't actually take the shares, they just sell the contract at a higher price
As far as the body

My body has been wrecked from manual labor that my shoulders feel like shit anyways. It is one of the reasons I trade. I have my own business and this is a way for me to work two jobs. My business and trading. 

I like the lifestyle when in profit lol I want to experience it more so I can run my business part time and focus more on my health. 

I figure at this point I would rather ache in pain with a strong back and shoulders then keep living in pain and getting weaker as I continue to work in my business. 

Plus I have a few friends that have been in prison and what you can tear working out goes out the window when you have nothing but time. 

That‚Äôs how trading feels like you have nothing but time. When in fact the more time you trade the brain gets tired and wears out. Working out is
Helping me deal with the time management. 

Passive effect is getting more fitter and stronger. 

If you can do push ups then perhaps just push your self with something intense you can handle and work towards push-ups and sit ups etc. 

But the point is it has to be though, even if it will tear a muscle. 

What ever it takes to stop entering the market and giving the market your money.

Last I have made good profits. I‚Äôm tired of giving it back. I usually find that I make profits my first few trades. Then at some point I lose. Then I make 2-3 losses right after. Respecting this work out should prevent that. As well as give me time to move profits around and re evaluate my self. Before wrecking!!?
I expect a ton of people on this sub to sell at 100 if it hits that.  I will have a hard time holding myself as this is my first big play. That being said, it has been nothing short of a fucking pleasure gentlemen. u/deepfuckingvalue you're a King among peasants.

Most of you guys act like he was investing and fucked up because he didn't just long SPY @ the dip. He's clearly trying to learn, I imagine trying to learn reading a chart, plotting support and resistance, drawing trend lines, learning how to find and understand FA, and then executing a trade. Yeah most you guys just bought some shit and never looked at a chart and it made you more money than him, but hes trying to learn, not gamble. "I threw a dart at some stocks and don't even know what support or resistance lines are, I made 10k this month!" good job, you're gambling. The fact that this went over the head of almost all of you here baffles me. He's learning to trade stocks, hes not investing.
RemindMe! 3 hours
Idk why anyone would expect the stimulus bill to address clean energy. That‚Äôs an entirely different conversation
Burry has been long on CVS so he probably knows something too, maybe just extremely oversold?
Mmm, this is what tends to happen

1. You make stuff you think is nice and it‚Äôs well made and you put a lot of effort in 

2. You set up a booth at a market

3. No one buys anything and you sit there for 3 hours

4. People come up and finger your goods while clutching a hamburger and then walk away without saying anything 

5. Someone asks if you can sell a piece for half price and gets upset when you say no 

6. One person comes to talk to you about your craft but all they are interested in is telling you about the what they do and how interesting it is and did they mention the 43 pieces they made last week and then describes each piece in detail. 

7. Then it starts to rain

Is there an earnings calendar anywhere
Yes. Am currently cash and will prob stay this way until i got refuel some on RH. I use TDA now and the margin rates are awful. 

As long as you are trading options it settles the next morning. Stonks take 2 days to settle.
I used Zillow to sell an investment property. Sold it pretty fast. I just listed it for free there and no where else.
Lumen was not a merger. Centurylink changed their name. I think it's a real solid play. I also feel like they make a good acquisition for like a TMUS (another solid play - but the dip) who uses them for their wireless network backhaul. Maybe the name change was part of packaging all the entities they own to sell, even though they haven't integrated their assets well.
Michael Burry was also referencing purchasing BB since February of 2020 IIRC. Back when it was sub $8. 

I can‚Äôt believe it took WSB basically a year to jump on it. Like I‚Äôm happy you all finally got on board but holy fuck you all missed out some some cash.

I'd recommend yall to BUY HCLN tomorrow it released today at $20, its basically Canada's version of ICLN but Trudeau is actually pushing clean energy hard as fuck unlike Biden who won't even mention it anymore
I think you have to apply for it just google how to trade AH on ToS
Listen, I know what sub I‚Äôm in. Just curious if you pinned it on anything in particular. The float is a GREAT sign

I read a post about a month ago telling me to buy. I did. I held it through a brutal earnings report. I held it through 28% losses. My friends laughed at me, my family laughed at me. Who‚Äôs laughing now?

I mean just watch after hours right now. Tomorrow looks like a 40s day.
Thanks! I've been glued to reddit all day
Good question.  I have spent so many years "in the routine" that I can't even sleep in on weekends/holidays.  up at 5:30 and ready to go.

I would probably take several months just to decompress and let it become "real".  I suspect that I will eventually find some kind of low stress job just to stay busy; but I no longer want the stress of managing large groups of employees, projects, deadlines....

I will ponder this.  Thank you

This threesome I‚Äôm having with GME and BB is hurting my cock
I think sell the news movement into gap fill down to 54 by next week
I don't believe your premise is correct. For the life of me I can't understand how I'd replicate an AAPL Feb 130c with AAPL shares and a loan. Even if you trade actively to keep the delta right, how do you account for time value?

That thread makes me so fucking happy, watching his streams for a while now too he just seems like such a genuine, deserving guy.  Did his fucking homework and he's set for life
I didn‚Äôt know there were types of investors other than money hungry ones - does anyone do this just for the losses?
yeah, those rockets seem hella confusing
He is extremely excited about this. We‚Äôve been running family businesses for 3 generations now and he thinks it‚Äôs funny that millionaires and billion dollar hedge funds could get bent over due to a gaming company stock! He took money out of his 401k to join in. üòÇ
Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour is in this bill? jeez that's bold, not that I'm against raising the minimum wage, but unless that gets toned down to something more like "when this bill passes, we will start to slowly raise the federal minimum wage", I would guess this isn't getting done.

Adjust that and I think this goes through though, a lot of what we saw for the past few years was bills just not even getting to the floor.
Lold thanks

Nice!  In some communities, the community/rec center will offer a variety of classes, including computer/application literacy.  Where I live, pretty active (well, in normal times), and the instructors can collect a nominal fee.  Would be a good way to stay engaged, contribute, and earn a bit of pocket money.
Could you possibly be so fucking retarded you don‚Äôt think insider trading is rampant on Wall Street? There is no fucking way in hell they aren‚Äôt trading insider knowledge constantly. It‚Äôs so insanely hard to prove it in court - how the fuck do you convict someone (without a recording obviously) for a crime that consists of speaking one or two sentences? 

Someone already said it better than I - ‚Äúif you ain‚Äôt cheatin you ain‚Äôt tryin‚Äù

No way in hell is that not the mantra for these massive financial firms.
I‚Äôm up like 1500% in half a year on a stock that most people in this sub was saying is a retard investment

Then you'll be left holding lot of worthless stock if you're not careful.
won't make you nearly as much as the GME calls will be
Or course you can just cash out 100k
I have that call but I‚Äôm too stupid to check what it‚Äôs worth after hours
I bought 21 $22.50 Calls for March 19th last week while FCAU was at 18.50.  I got a message last night that there was a corporate action and my FCAU calls are now FCAU1, and FCAU's price dropped by $2.00.  It sounds like now I still have to meet the same strike otherwise it will expire worthless, but if it does meet the strike I get an additional 184euros/contract if I exercise them?  The stock price said it was up 3% today, but it's $2 below what it was yesterday.  I'm confused.....
I got a Webull  account for their special offer on free stocks and will be honest with you it is way wacky to navigate their site and I thought Fidelity was complicated

Woof.
fuck it of course i‚Äôll throw a a little money at BB, feels good
1. For a same maturity you don't have different bonds, each bond has a slightly different maturity. Use as your benchmarks the most liquid points: on the run bonds and futures. 
2. Indeed that's why people interpolate in-between bonds to build artificial rates for points like 2y; 5y, 10y, 20y, 30y etc...
3. Futures roll, they never reach maturity.
Bro, I don't even know what I'm doing.
I never thought I'd be buying fucking BB anything in 2021 but here I am doing exactly that.
False
Shit, why?
well lets say you sell a call at 45 when its at 40. The stock goes to 45 so you buy it to cover, later, itll get exercised at 50, but you lost no money, you just had your money held up for a few moments is all. You still make money from the contract iself, there's no risk except the risk of you losing money because the stock goes back below the 45 point at which you purchased it.
Go to WSB and search BB you will see a couple of posts with the DD flair and there is some pretty compelling evidence of future growth
At this point Biden might as well give the 2k stimmy in GME shares

Reminder we in the greatest bullmarket ever sooo buy bu buyy buyydennn
It always does
They could raise it to $3k and people would still buy it. Also the service providers always finess the plan so it's not as expensive anyway (Galaxy S20 5G cost: $800, I paid $350)
Puts expire tomorrow so just need it to hold up for a day
.... What's the original movie?
Teach me senpai
I'm still trying to understand how calls work, can you give an example of what you mean and explain a bit? Thanks!
Same 10 1/22C $15
I'm definitely feeling less worried about the possibility of a solid dip by the minute üòÖ
you can still sell them tomorrow right?

Its not a buy and hold forever stock.  Look at the long term oil charts. 

Its a good trade.  Then out
i think im gonna start with divs since i wanna get those as young as i can but when i get more profits ill definitely put it into ETFS and maybe some growth stocks focusing on tech and clean energy
Could Wall St shorts be covering chunks of GME PM/AH to try limit a VW type squeeze?

I bought more cryptocurrency when it tanked the other day, the opposite of panic selling.   I knew the risk of trying to catch the knife when it falls. Made all my losses back by having balls of steel.   Maybe hanging out with the WSB autists isn't always a bad thing.  I will do the same if the market fails.  Double down at the bottom.

Fuk u gay ber, let the fomo consume you
Lmao my bad hahaha yes undervalued
As far as I‚Äôm concerned this is the biggest news event of the last 2 weeks...

It‚Äôs like this guy just walked into the vault while the bankers just sat and watched while he walked away with all of their money. Think about it, excluding those who inherit money, the small population of people who have $7mm+ in liquidity have dedicated their lives to outperforming their peers in their particular field of work. Meanwhile, this fucking guy just yolo‚Äôs into a decaying retail stock and magically goes from a typical broke redditor to a god damn yuppie. It‚Äôs like the guy in band of brothers who just calmly walks through the battle line during the battle of the bulge in the middle of enemy fire and comes back with the goods, like nothing even happened. Feels like this just shouldn‚Äôt happen in real life lol.
Sorry, I meant a $10M offering
Given your response, I highly recommend you learn about options in a more structured way by reading investopedia or watching YouTube videos. Picking up bits and pieces of information here without understanding basic fundamentals is not gonna help.

What about TSM? I bought the top and now it hurts right here ìÇ∏
Cohen kool aid manned that wall and buried Melvins bitch ass in the rubble
I‚Äôm pretty long on shares, got in at 17 bucks or so. This shit trades at like 6-7x EBITDA if you just look at the telesat financials. Not to mention that doesn‚Äôt give any credit for LEO 5G deployment. 

http://www.circleid.com/posts/20201229-telesat-proposal-for-larger-constellation-canadian-darpa-contracts/

Looks like they‚Äôre doubling their constellation size so sounds pretty bullish, and also recently closed a 600M agreement with the Canadian government. Here‚Äôs hoping it gets picked up in ARKX!!
Yeah I'm okay with April/May calls, I stopped yoloing weeklies, it hurts my butt
I'm losing faith here cause I'm seeing downgrades and shit. Just because INTC changed their fucking CEO somehow means AMD should go down? Fuuuuuck that
why? isnt it a good thing
ah, ok. never used robinhood. just my schwab
The way I look at it is all the P&Ds have left the stock. So it's a steady healthy growth from now on.

Ok ok thanks, I just wanted some insight since I‚Äôve been seeing hold on these gme posts didn‚Äôt know if to hold all the way through until it expires or they meant hold stocks or simply both.
I went all in at close!!! Yes brother!!!
Still learning a lot about strategies but how did you profit from the 1/15 40c if it‚Äôs substantially OTM?

I have been riding 4/16 23c since November and I‚Äôm up like 450% with ample room left
I just gave in and bought yesterday at close, I‚Äôm sitting up on a 25% cushion today, so I doubled down, because it can‚Äôt go tits up!
Everyone and their moms buying GME now. GAMESTOP IS BACK Y‚ÄôALL

Lol I just gave someone the advice in the first paragraph almost exactly. I find it's best to set limits and stops for almost everything so I don't even try to second guess myself. I agree it's useless to try to maximize gains, that is where people mess up.

Sell? What's that? Give Cohen some time. Any news will be positive and this stock will just keep trending up.

I find it much easier to just grab something, hold for a day or two, and resell. I've day traded a couple things, but it seems like most stocks rise a day or two, then take a small drop.

It's not that it does. It is that it can. You just gave a reason why.

In essence it is not a black and white world; to say, "Oh no, that wouldn't!" is mostly theory. It's cute. At best.
Hopefully everyone in WSB
Thats me actually up 250 k in my paperaccount fack
I have a large position in GME at $23 average. I am concerned about the huge number of expiring contracts and the effect it will have on SP and whatever the hell the short squeeze concept says.
Get fucked
Today I added 4k shares , to a total of 6k, i'm with you on the spaceship
Fuck it rebought GME after paper handing yesterday. Shorts went up massively over 70 000 000 today. This isn‚Äôt going bankrupt it‚Äôs going up up and away. I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm risking what I‚Äôve made on it

Stock is low enough to be pumped as in robinhood autists can afford it
GME isn't even at its fair market value. 6b in revenue, 500m in cash, and current valued at 2.78b market value.  Price/sales is at .50, we'll see roller coaster action. Maybe some deep dips, but at this point. All the media attention means GME GOING OUT OF THE GALAXY üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Most genomics companies are going to fail or never go up beyond random intraweek pump n dumps. It's the one sector where I'd always want to go with an ETF (I only know of ARKG and PBE), since there's almost no one to know in advance which company will win big in genomics.

How could you have possiblly timed it so well? I don't understand
OH MY GOD GME
100?
I thought this sub was retarded for the GME memes but holy crap. I really hope that you are all successful with BB
I agree with you and I also think one of the main issues is getting high speed internet into the hands of people, but with how tech and innovation are moving its becoming more clear that its in everyones interest that people get access to high speed internet(except ofcourse these shit ISPs and their shills), and its a question of time before it happens. It has years to go before its viable and thats why im still sticking to GME, I dont doubt that Ryan will put GME on top for many years. I just dont view GME as a very long term play

Common knowledge
He also called the GME short squeeze
borrowing against ourselves no big
That's why ICLN dropped today. Insiders were selling.
Bot told me that he removed my comment because it mentioned the forbidden coins that rhyme with bipto-durrency. Those things will drive the need for graphics cards, and given that bipto durrency is booming right now, we'll probably see a surprise on the earnings report
What was the expiry on those?
Nope but am perfectly ok with the play I made 400k on XL already...
I remember being worried that I missed the boat when I put $40k into GME 2/19 calls at $34.25 this morning. 

Then I remember feeling like I was ‚Äúmaking a sacrifice for the greater good‚Äù when I bought 1000 shares at $36.20. 

Guys, even though GME is up huge, **it‚Äôs not too late to get on the train**. 

GET IN!!!
This needs a real answer. I've commented about this a few times in the last 48 hours and nobody can provide a sound explanation to how this directly increases stock price. 

It's pleasing to know that Melvin Capital's 50k+ puts are expiring worthless, but what makes people think this will rocket GME's price?
lol GME
Did you do the DCF yourself? If so why did you choose 30% annual revenue growth (seems completely fallacious based on historical growth) and how is this possibly a conservative valuation to also apply 35x terminal value EBITDA multiple?

Trying to do my DD here before I enter any long position
I came back to the PC and looked and was like WAT?!
Biden's plan got posted and very little on green energy. RIP ICLN gang
Hi Cramer
He‚Äôs not taking the chance but IV is so damn high that it‚Äôs worth it versus the delta + at this point.
Follow trends.  Identify key levels. Today buying gme on the break out of 38 was an easy options trade.
If people here didn‚Äôt understand how the market works, then how did we win at their own game? This makes no sense!

Can we please create a separate GME thread
I agree, not getting all these super short term way otm plays. It's almost impossible to lose money with gme this week, yet nature finds a way, I guess.
I will be excersing my expiring calls. The first time I've ever done that.
Up 10% already!
Fidelity has Robin Hood beat on fractional shares hands-down
lol its thursday
Fun fact: If you bought $1000 of HOME 1/15 calls 2 weeks ago they would be worth $77000 right now.
I too struggle with being a paperhanded bitch.

Basically though, when you find yourself wanting to sell, stop and reevaluate. Is the thesis that made you buy in still true? And if you were 100% cash, would you buy into it right now? If so, then don't sell.

THE SHORT SQUEEZE: HOW A COMMUNITY OF UGLY DEGENERATES REVIVED GAMESTOP

Bought some! Playing weekly‚Äôs with this because of the 6 days they have to finish the squeeze. Also the premium on a 55c next week out is like $3(prob more now) which is just absolutely bonkers.
Shit heads probably haven‚Äôt ever used Reddit.
ill have to look into this then! Just thought that the cut from 50k would be like 10-20k for a good one but ive never looked into it i just assumed it was only for the super rich

As the other redditors have explained there are many factors at play which determine a contract's price. I'd simply reiterate that the stock price is one underlying value which directly affects your option contact's value. 

For example:
If I sell you an option to buy a bar of gold today for $1,000 and the price of a gold bar is also $1,000, then your option is not worth anything (because you can buy the gold bar in the market for the same price I'm giving you the option for). However, if tomorrow, the price of a bar of gold is $1,200, all of a sudden the option I sold you to buy the bar of gold for $1,000 has a higher worth. Most people would sell the option to buy the gold and pocket the profit before the option expires (in case the price of gold bars drops below $1,000 tomorrow). Other people might exercise their option at expiration, and hope that gold is worth more than $1,000 (so they can sell it for a profit or hold on to it long term, if that's their goal).

Just replace "gold bar" with "stock option" in the example above and that's the general idea.

I didn't realize that most people don't hold options all the way until expiration and instead sell them for a profit until I started trading options. That was a big learning point for me, personally.
I just saw that. We want 45!

One thing that jumped at me is you need higher life insurance on your wife. If she passes, you will need support for your daughters. Babysitter/nanny/whatever. Getting the things done that your wife contributes to the family is probably a lot more than $100K.
Yeah they are retarded unless you have a ton of capital and you're 100% okay with the stock fucking mooning and the strike you chose being cool with the profit. I waited until literally this week to a sell a  CC on my Gamestop shares. Feel ya brotha.

Haha thanks! It has been an insanely emotional Rollercoaster these past 2 weeks. Not sure how much more I can handle.
Damn! You‚Äôre double dipping on the massive gains with BB and TLRY!
I've only bought something like 2 shares @ 19, first time making profit actually
Should I buy more tomorrow ?
And I see these posts that say there is for sure a bubble.   The problem is a bubble can only be a bubble if it pops.    So in the end you have one group saying it isn't a bubble and others that are.   If it is a bubble it will pop and you will be right.   If it doesn't pop you will be wrong.   In the end what will happen will happen.   If you are so sure it will then short it and make a fortune.   Otherwise pronouncements about what will happen are meaningless.    I mean it is easy to make a guess on what will happen if you have no actual interest in what happens.    A little different to place a 50k bet that it will or won't.
The 1/29 65 calls are basically worthless at the moment but quarterly earnings are set for 1/26 so

Some of my friends ski patrol and they have had mixed experiences. Some love it. One friend, who is a paramedic and arguably the most well trained on his patrol hates it because the boss power trips and essentially ignores modern changes and advancements in equipment and methods. 

Generally speaking, patrolling for the benefits (ski pass) probably isn‚Äôt worth it.

I am not sure, but I think the more pertinent question is how you filed taxes for the entity. Was it a sole proprietorship/disregarded entity? In real estate, mixing multiple properties in one entity has the potential for tax implications, although I am not knowledgeable enough to know what they all might be, especially not knowing what type of real estate you might invest in in the future.
With due respect, 1st amendment is nothing about companies banning free speech, but about public government banning free speech. I am sure some are always more than welcome to vent on streets and I have no problem, but given what happened on Capitol hill last Wednesday, the kind of politics shouldnt be allowed to share information as same as terrorists sharing the information since both equally share and promote the violence, if anything else. 

Agree. From investment perspective, this means that whatever the social media does, they will be criticized since they cant satisfy everyone. It's like investing in pharmaceutical industry, where one FDA approval means mooning, while another FDA denials means red days. There are so many other business models that can outperform social media, so I wouldnt really spend much on it.

The CRA did not design the TFSA well. Everything that happens in your TFSA is tax-free and they cannot touch including options. Some Canadians have become millionaires in their TFSA and the CRA cannot touch it. The only limit on the TFSA is the contribution room, any amount you go over is taxed at 1% per month. Dividends earned in the TFSA are also tax-free.

Now get out there and buy some fucking GME! To the moon!
I said buy puts you stubborn fuck.
Each call contract allowed him to buy 100 shares at $20 each, he could have just exercized the 1000 contracts and buy 100 000 shares at $20 each, or $2m, and then own 100 000 shares more. Instead of spending $2m he just sold the contracts.

1. Sell a call option for ABC Corp at $X for Jan 8 at strike price of $Y. This means someone has the right to buy 100 shares at $Y from you.

2. You own 100 shares of ABC Corp which means you are covered. If you didn‚Äôt own the 100 shares and they exercise, you MUST purchase 100 shares at whatever the price is and sell them all at $Y.

There will eventually be a downward correction. GME has a 2.18B market cap meaning a fair market price is 33.13.

When this first popped huge that was actually a market correction because it was severely underpriced. It wasn‚Äôt the squeeze. What we witnessed today was Genuine buying from people interested in the company now that Cohen and his team have board seats. Naturally some of this price increase is shorts covering, but the big time shorts have yet to cover. I foresee a series of consecutive days like we had today before Melvin and Company are forced to cover sending the price skyrocketing and then absolutely plummeting as everybody takes profits. But I imagine it will still settle relatively high.

In what world do their financials not look good for the stock price?? Even after the recent stock movement they are trading at just over 1 p/e ratio which is insanelylow for online retailers. They have strong brand recognition (some of it for the wrong reasons i will give you that), 300% growth in online sales, new all-star chewy management and are massive in other areas such as collectables. Their business model is changing and if RC succeeds in his vision its easily over $50 WITHOUT a squeeze.
VANCOUVER, BC, Jan. 14, 2021 /CNW/ - Mountain Valley MD Holdings Inc.

Adding bond funds isn't about diversification, it's about stability and downside protection. In no way are REITs or dividend stocks comparable to bonds/bond funds.
I‚Äôm pretty sure they should be reporting income to the Danish but if so, it is entirely legal (might be certain breaches regarding insurance or something similar).

PC hardware would be sorta full circle for them.

Back in the 80's when the stores were still the Electronics Boutique branded and all the mergers happened they actually sold computers (Amigas, etc.) in addition to games. Then we know they abandoned the pc gaming segment completely. It would be ironic if they go on that direction and it saves them.

PC hardware would be a smart move because there's very limited brick and mortar competition in that space right now, and it seems like the enthusiast builder segment is really taking off (I've been building computers since high school, and I've never seen the level of participation as I see now). Microcenter is my go to, but they don't have many locations. Best Buy doesn't really focus on this area as far as in-store space goes. I think the challenge there would be that many Gamestop locations are somewhat small, so merchandising and stock space could be a challenge with all the products that are out there.

If you're holding for the long term I think Opendoor is worth adding to your portfolio given your strategy. 

It's a few years away from profitability but it could become the Amazon of iBuyer real estate platforms. Break even on the sale and extract value while in the funnel (for buyers or sellers). 

Will take a few years to obtain necessary data but given the pile of cash and 45 days at most of holding inventory and the downside is somewhat reduced. Obviously still a speculative growth company though.
Well consensus estimates I think are .85 and the high side is over 3.00 so there's a lot to be optimistic about.
Hey so I've got another question I've been wondering and don't know who to ask sorry.

From my understanding when we trade on platforms such as MT4 we're trading CFD's through our broker and essentially betting on the way the price moves instead of actually exchanging money. 

Surely this means that any potential counterparty must also be someone trading CFD's and cannot be, for example, someone exchanging money for a holiday like another commenter suggested.

So this would mean the CFD market is just a subsection of the forex market and does not overlap with other sections such as the spot market.

However, CFD's are settled using the spot Forex market exchange rates and so liquidity remains high even though you can only trade with other CFD traders.

Is this right?

Sorry for lengthy paragraphs just difficult to wrap head around lol.

There is a difference between trading and investing. Investing you can do a good job for a reasonable amount of time/effort. Trading you cannot because the space is incredibly competitive, as retail you don't have the technology and your costs are higher on a per trade basis.

Gme really is retarded. I hope y‚Äôall make tendies
I just bet on the short squeeze and Melvin Capital + BoA have so many short positions, this will heavily move the stock when they are forced to close. Like getting halted heavy.
ok true. That's what I traded today as well. Bought 3810Cs mid day sold for a loss and got 3800Ps. Do you only trade short term?
Don‚Äôt do that then lmao üòÇ
yeah true, i think im gonna put 80% in ETFS and 20% in EV and clean energy with biden becoming president

Heh, ya sounds about right. To be honest though, if you've achieved step #1 then you're in a good spot. 

Better than me anyway. So cheer up!
True that, now we know. Shit even wallstreet journal recognizes.
100 on margin at 9.64. doing my part
You have a really poor understanding (or a deliberate, willful misinterpretation) of how exchanges work

Market making algorithms use bots, yes.   Do you really think market makers should pay someone to sit around and make markets like it's 1893?
Risk of $TSLA has gone up.

Also keep in "post hoc" fallacy isn't valid in the stock market when it comes to explosive gains. The higher the gains in the past the lower the gains the future. Even with an asset with Bitcoin this applies. Each peak is seeing less and less of a gain. 

$TSLA is has seen +1000% gains if you bought below 60$(360$ pre split). This implies future gains will much lower. 

If you have seen large gains from this stock, definitely a good time to take profits while they're available considering the risk. Consider partial profits if you are willing to continue holding the risk. Might not be a bad idea to purchase some low strike puts as insurance if you want to continue holding...especially if you hold a lot.
I can't wait to see what happens after he hops on board with BB like he did GME, banks will lose money cause they have fucked people for so long so we are doing trading our selfs and making way more then with there help.
True lol I can just dump it in more ICLN calls (April or further it‚Äôs looking like) in that case. If it goes up I can be happy with what I have

I literally blinked and GME rose to $42 LMAO
Paperhands GME regretting they already sold
Burberry all the way, or was it Blackberry?
They write software and their products are used in electric cars, fucking spacex rockets, and a shitload of other stuff. Not a phone company which is why they just sold their phone patents.

Not retarded, visionary. So go full retard and get your ass to tendietown, ya freaking artists.
FUCK I used all my margin on GME and GI K bud I wish I put in more
Forgetting about it and finding a new play? Or maybe spend your life savings buying GME in post right now? Either are fine.
65 offers on a house round here (SoCal). Think the market is just fine.
It's never been more popular tbh. That pokemon go summer really was the catalyst.

Now for new sets? Gamestop preorders are shut off for new card sets within hours. It's insane. Go to Walmart. Hang out by the card section. You'll legit see so many ppl scoping it out to resell. It's ridiculous

Lol fair enough, I was also doing you a favor if you would have listened to reason though
Sprouts is currently trading at 6.43x EV/EBITDA. This is a very attractive valuation for this company.

* The Fresh Market was acquired in 2016 for \~6.9x EV/EBITDA.
* Save-A-Lot was acquired in 2016 for \~7x EV/EBITDA.
* Whole Foods was acquired in 2017 for \~11x EV/EBITDA.
* Roundy's was acquired in 2015 for about \~7x EV/EBITDA.
* Smart & Final was acquired in 2019 for about \~6.5x EV/EBITDA.

We saw $250k of the January 2022 $20P's sold to open for $2.62.

We then saw $250k of the March $20C's bought to open for $1.65 each.

We have also seen more aggressive selling of the March $21P for $2 on the 11th.

\-------------------------------------

The chart is fantastic and is a technical breakout, but my money says they're getting acquired. I am very long.
GME is just the best thing isn't it. The fact they haven't even brought out more shares to increase capital means they are trying to fuck the shorters who made a mess of them initially
Uhh what's the GME news in AH?
Can't Stop.
Can't believe I made the right decision and pumped another 10k in earlier, while taking a huge dump and reading üöÄüöÄüöÄ DD

Well, it depends. If they plan to keep funding it then it may make sense to hold it. Not worth the $1300 now if that‚Äôd be the end of it. 

If they expect you to fund it going forward, yes I‚Äôd likely surrender as cash value life insurance is a crap investment.

If you created a bank account without her, does your mother have the means to punish you? If so, you are not adulting. You might want to consider whether your parent's financial support is of great enough value to you that you will surrender your autonomy for it. Right now you think that the allowance is worth humoring her, and allowing her to control you. In 10 years, you'll be concerned with access to the vacation house or your inheritance.

Well done on the Tesla stock btw. I've been sitting on 25 (100 post split) shares since May 2017. Originally had 50, but I sold half of it a in February of last year to recapture my initial investment (still kicking myself over that, lol).

hahaha that‚Äôs fair. I can‚Äôt do the IV math. I didn‚Äôt think it mattered if it hits 1.5$ which I think it will. If you buy enough that you can exercise the calls  @ .5 (so you‚Äôll need $50 to exercise it) you can literally cerci see the calls at the top, and sell the shares immediately at whatever price. This‚Äôll minimize some risk & fairly cheap way to do it

yep thats, basically how my day went
I do have a small short on tesla, I would say to the argument that the bubble will never pop is that no stock in history has stayed went this high in so little time on no fundamentals, and not crashed soon after, I like to say "I can't predict the future but I can learn from the past"
Somebody let me know if GME hits $45
OMG 1% AFTER HOURS WE ARE ALL RICH.........
Hold Nio.. You got gains locked in by getting in at $8/share. Who's to say Nio won't balloon and split in the future like Tesla? Honestly any good news will keep pushing that floor higher

Wait until no one qualifies for financing anymore when the rates go up.

When I have a low priced option like that I almost always turn it into a bull debit spread with a higher strike price option. For some reason I didn't do that with these. Could have sold the 10.5c for .02 instead and still made $50/contract if it stays above 10.50.

GUH.

Am I the only one who thinks GME can hit $200 next month? shorts haven't even started covering yet, once they do, this stock might jump 100% in a single day
Yeah, but not tomorrow dude. Plus, if it's really a MASSIVE selloff, then why not wait a day for confirmation? If it's massive, then missing it by a single day won't matter.

Hahaha alright kiddos I know this new society trains you to not accept humor without being triggered, but it was a joke nonetheless üòÇ But, everything I said was still true, young, white, gifted 40k from a wealthy grandfather, which I give you props for turning it Into what it is now. PS- I‚Äôm white/black 

All I‚Äôm saying is, most people don‚Äôt have 50k even in their 40‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs good to see you using it wisely in investing for your future instead of what a lot of kids would do and blow it!
The best of luck to you my fellow.

Grab shares of SNDL if you‚Äôre interested in the cannabis segment ‚Äî trading at ~$0.69/share, they‚Äôve gotta get up past $1 within 6 months or they‚Äôre delisted. That said, a focus on concentrates is definitely where the market is headed imho.

It would seem that when you have a paid account with an actual brokerage, they supply earnings, projections and estimates of how many pre market-open buy orders (that you can submit even in free trading apps like Robinhood) there are and how they're instant execution when the market opens, will drive up share prices. 

I put in an order via Robinhood, for shares of Petco at around 7AM, with a max buy of $30/share, and was able to buy in at $21/share. Unfortunately, Petco didn't blow up like poshmark did, so the gains were minimal, but you live and learn.

I think its a common misconception here that we actually know the current short interest on GME...that data is only released like every two weeks and the next release is scheduled for 12/27...

Until then, we can only guess how many shorts are still in the market
Or buy now? AH still open to wsb retards
It had a great day, no need for the sarcasm.
You can make profit it on it tomorrow. Just sell near open.

I honestly don't get it. Everybody seems to just HATE oil, but I've only heard two legitimate bear cases for oil:

1. Saudi and Russia potentially flooding market. But Saudi just voluntarily pulled back 1mil bb/d of production to help increase prices, so don't see that happening soon. 
2. Investors are forward looking and may be reluctant to invest in oil when the market is moving towards green energy. I do agree with this, however if oil booms over its previous price high it will create a short term surge in stock values and there may be a temporary but heavy rotation into the sector.

Im just keeping 10% in cash so I can buy some dips if a correction comes.
So when is this short squeeze for GME expected to be over?
Thank Mr. Melvin, very cool
Can I sell my calls first ?
I completely understand people who feel a massive selloff incoming. Even the bulls will tell you the market is overextended.

What I don't get is trying to time it by shorting indexes. If it's gonna be a big massive selloff, then missing it by a day won't matter. Just wait for it to actually start before getting your puts.
Not enough volume.
yeah im extremely blessed to have both my grandpas pay for my college so thats why im using the 50k on investing instead since i would of had close to 6 figures in student debt if i wanna get my masters too.

it‚Äôs almost like high schools and colleges are working with chegg. had a college test once and it was straight from chegg/quizlet. they don‚Äôt give a fuck, everyone is making money expect you of course. you‚Äôll be making money soon once you get your degree :)
Bought in a couple months ago with 40k. Look at the daily MAs. Were about to get some golden crosses heading into spring with tons of space to gap up. This is going to make me a bunch of money really fast and it started with its move today. It's now on the fringe of the gap up areas. Yes please.
So bc I wouldn‚Äôt buy into GME at all bc I‚Äôm a bitch and keep feeing like I missed out, I downloaded Robinhood and deposited $2000and rage bought BB and Tilray calls earlier. My money is doubled. This is the way

google it or call your broker. Usually they exchange using a ratio of some sort based on the prices. If you dont have enough shares required for 1 share of google they just pay you the cash equiv.

I blew up my account shorting PLTR, even though I made money on the way up. Sold short the day before it blew up 25%, woke up late and I went to 0.

I feel you. I never short anymore, the strength of this sub is unwieldly.
Whoops meant 1/27

As soon as the new BB is available for pre order I‚Äôm buying it
No, it just raises the price of everything low skilled workers create.

Tight. Tight. Tight.
Anyone know why robinhood got rid of FIT?
I looked, and IWM is up roughly +125% off its lows from March, which is about +25% for the year (Feb. 2020 - Jan. 2021). QQQ is up about +95% from March and 35% for the year. It's close, so, your point is well taken. Still, the recent buying has felt more or less indiscriminate, so the rug pull is gonna be pretty brutal when it comes.
Im still far from breaking even with my losses that i had last year. But i love this community and you guys are awesome. Basically been holding GME since $26. 580 shares. Lets go for the final rip boys
Essentially yeah. But you gotta remember that a contract declines in value every single day. I'm looking at the contract right now, and since its a new one if it increased to like 10.7 tomorrow you will already make some money.

I wish you good luck my man! Make that shit print and kick your wife's bf out of your house.

try shooting for 1/29 if anything, see if you make gains and keep at it if it's still mooning by then.

The truth about Tesla is they knew about the problems in their cars years before they did a recall. Why?? Because back then a recall would have tanked their company. They put profits in front of people, plain and simple. The other car companies you mentioned at least did recalls. It‚Äôs a tough business and takes decades for people to work out every kink and design flaw in a car. This is why I trust all other car manufacturers over Tesla. They have been making cars for decades and decades longer than Tesla and have consistently issued recalls whenever a problem arises in their vehicles. Tesla is reckless and dangerous, and their entire company and stock price is being propped up by idiot cult members that have no fore site or ability to see the larger picture.

"Could have bought a index fund..."

Maybe..  
That would have worked out this time.

But on average the S&P returns roughly 8% per year.  
With active trading you can make consistent returns year in year out far outperforming index funds .  
Even in a bear market.

If you need the money to pay your bills take it out otherwise stick to your plan if it‚Äôs working. Don‚Äôt fix what isn‚Äôt broken.

Another angle - sell covered calls to lower your cost basis and lower potential losses if you‚Äôre so concerned about a dip. Then you can just wheel down.
ARKG is mooning after hours too hell yeah

Roaring Cat.  RC.  Ok.
Your brokerage has to make an effort to submit accurate information to the exchange, so they probably automatically check for this. Even if the ticket is marked incorrectly, in my experience it will be tied out correctly by the time the trade settles and the next day's OI numbers come out. That may not be the case with your brokerage.

If you somehow end up with an up/down, this is bad for you because it means you can get assigned. Call your brokerage.
We should start bullying Melvin capital from now on, just find every short position they have and fuck it up
Ahhhh ok
Options take time for the cash to settle. It might post tomorrow. Depends on the broker, some take up to three days for options.

Melvin found out why they‚Äôre called FDs
> My plan is to not count on Social Security

The reasonable worst-case scenario for SS is that nothing is done. In that case, SS will pay out ~75% of benefits starting in ~2034 and will continue at that level for the foreseeable future. Planning for $0 from SS is simply not realistic. 

As to the actual article, I think raising the FRA is one of many options that could be considered. I would hope that they also increased delayed benefits by the same (e.g. if they raise FRA from Age 67 to Age 69, also raise the delayed benefits from Age 70 to Age 72. For most people, delaying social security provides a better return as it increases the guaranteed income you receive (and no, it's not apples-to-apples to compare your stock-based portfolio return to a SS benefit).
Depends on how much you pay for the APHA
Realistically having a ten bagger is very rare. If you cash out you inital investment you really arent going to lose much in future gains since you still have 85-90% invested. Also, since its January you wont owe taxes until 2022 on your sale. 

If it were me Id sell enough to cover my initial investment plus taxes and let the rest ride.

Congrats and all but what‚Äôs up with your obsession with cats?
Hopefully soon we will have fucked 43‚Äôs asshole and move onto 44‚Äôs.
If it behaves like I think, it's a flat or up open, followed by weakness later in the morning, and hard selling in the afternoon. 

I would watch closely. Sell now if you don't want the risk. Or, sell on signs of weakness tomorrow.
It was me, I‚Äôm exercising also
This is the fucking wayüöÄüåôüí∞
Selling those shares in a contract is what I mean.
10% is 10%. Congrats on your gains! Wishing you all the best for the remainder of 2021.

My only tip would be to fund your account with more money, buy shares of solid companies and just let them ride while you do some trading on the side. I found this to be the best way to store some money for the long run while still having some side money to trade with. Ride the market up and down, maybe pick a stock with a nice dividend.

Anyway, congrats again!

They don't gotta be better they just gotta be decent and undercut the price. Tesla probably gonna be solid for a long time. 300B is still a valuation for a very good company.

Little book that still bears the market- Greenblatt
Yup, releasing in Feb and ICLN going north like my pee pee
why did I dump my 1/15 gme 40c :(
Every day this week ICLN is up or down like .7%, then up half a percent after hours. Would be great if that last boost could be when the market is open. Gonna pop again soon
Returning to the lender could even maybe reduce price if they sell to pocket profit. The question is volume tho? All together they would need like 700 thousand contracts? Paying a premium on all of those, on top of the borrowing interest from the initial short, on top of the price difference they'd be currently paying for the shares themselves, is it enough to gap and over how long?
Rising up nicely now squeezy peasy
I have 300 shares and sold 3 calls at the 40 strike price. So tomorrow at expiry, the shares go away and I miss out on the gains above 40. It‚Äôs at 43 AH now

i don't care personally. i just wanted to give you heads up.  make that money!
Ahem, he made $300k+. Nothing to shake your head at, for sure, but he did not make $600k. Impressive, but still

I made over 320% on my TOS account in less than a month. We shall see if it sticks for a while year, but I'm gonna stick with the trading platform that works for me. RH's lags cost me a lot of money, and I lost 50% on that account (a bit was my fault, of course, but their flaws cost me a lot, too).
You mean up over 6%?
He had 1/15 20c x 1000. The calls give him the right to buy 100 shares at 20 each so $2000 x 1000 contracts = $2m
I would love to work at an airport in a job that lets me walk around a lot and interact with people, maybe one of those people who helps mobility-impaired folks get through the airport on wheelchairs.

$43 now. Can't wait to see the gap open tomorrow.

How many of these shorts will want to hold over a 3 day weekend?
Bro it's at 1.9 now. My recommendation would be wait for the inevitable dip tomorrow when people take out their profits. Then buy in and wait to sell Tuesday

You know it's üöÄ-time when this sub praises shares.
**Believe me when I say this as I have the experience to back it up. The people who take the longest to become successful traders always become the millionaires and billionaires. Those who dive in head first in the first year usually crash and burn in a matter of months to a few years especially in bear/bull markets like the one we're in right now. What's deceptive is those who dive in head first start out successful and then end up unsuccessful. Those who start out unsuccessful and stick with it end up successful.** 

**I can remember becoming a trader way back. The dot com bubble was in full swing back then and internet stocks were going parabolic. It felt exactly the same as the clean energy and EV sector hype of right now.** 

**So guess what?** **Every schmuck and his uncle were opening brokerage accounts and making money the FOMO was absolutely spreading like COVID it was infectious. One person would see another making money then jump on the band wagon however none of them once reflected that they were very new to the came. Had not traded a bear market. Didn't understand the concept of hedging or risk management all of which are the most important parts of trading successfully. Making money is actually the easiest part. Holding onto it though is a different matter.** 

**So at the time all of my so called friends were also making money. However I was not and I was confused by that as I was the one with the fundamental approach and the one who had studied many books and modelled themselves on billionaire investors. Gosh so many times did I nearly get FOMO and became one of them, but I didn't. In fact I suffered some of my biggest losses ever in that bull market leading up to the crash in 2001/2002.** 

**When the crash came in 2001-2002 literally all those schmucks and their uncles got obliterated and most vowed never to trade again. At this point I realized my friends were not my friends and were just holding me back. I started to value friends that added value to my life and when I realized that most of my friends subtracted value I ditched them all.**

**What happened to me though in the bear market? I absolutely thrived and was well prepared to trade it. The bear market of 2001/2002 I made my first million dollars. Meanwhile the FOMO gang and everyone else was getting their head put in a noose and internet stocks were getting slaughtered.** 

**I learned some core lessons though about accepting losses. Trading on fundamentals.    It took me roughly in total 10 years to become profitable the late 80s crash was what enticed me into markets. Now I remember back then there wasn't all these free resources for learning. Demo accounts didn't exist you had to use a simulator a long tedious process to backtest strategies. In this day and age people don't realize how lucky they are.** 

**The problem for most people is shutting the pollution that pollutes your mind out. Social media like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, the media all will stop you from becoming successful cut your ties with it. Even YouTube will stop you becoming successful. For every 1 good trading educational video there is 100 bad ones from bag holders, bad educators and portfolio pumpers. I only use Reddit for one purpose. To anonymously give back to people by giving some advice like this to my followers. AND to seek out new recruits to my fund.**

**Just remember when you start out trading. Trade on the 1hr & 1 day charts. It's much slower and the reason you should do this is it is very hard to get FOMO trading this way. You learn the same patterns needed to form a strategy. You learn price action but in a more slow controlled way. You'll also be trading with the funds and the banks which is great news as you'll learn to trade like a casino instead of learning to trade like the gambler.** 

**Anyway I don't know what happened today I have given lots of information. Value it because the chances of you seeing something like this again are remote.**

**Please don't private message me I have hundreds of people message me and I don't have time to respond, please respect my time. Also my spelling/grammar might be off I wasn't top of the class in English or any of my subjects in fact I'm a college drop out.**
Pretty much. In that example, $2 would be the cost of the call, and $8 would be the strike price, the agreed-upon-in-advance amount. 

Keep in mind that most calls are for, like, 100 shares, so the profit is a little more lucrative if the stock rises even a dollar in value.
Just got 1000 shares of $BB after hours at 10.39. Please send prayers for me.
Idk I feel like some or most stress from jobs like that is needing that job. Like I worked at Jimmy John's in high school and I didnt need that job at all. I had money saved up and no bills so we just had fun and messed around. Yeah customers can suck but if you dont care about getting fired, you can act however you want towards them. Side note we use to make Jimmy John's  pizzas with leftover bread dough and random ingredients we had. They were pretty good!
BB gang checking in! Let's ride this BBC to the moon!
Here‚Äôs a positive thing about GME.. I won‚Äôt even consider selling until at least $90. So if it crashes before then, I will never experience that ‚Äúoh fuck I had my finger right on the sell button why didn‚Äôt I click it reeeee‚Äù type of regret. Bc there‚Äôs no version of me almost selling and then not selling. IM NOT FUCKIN LEAVING

Something like this exactly shows how much paths can vary:

[https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/financial-independence/](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/financial-independence/)

Certainly the "ideal" would be to dump all your cash at the lowest point in your career but you run into the age-old problems of not having the money yet and not knowing when that happens.  The more money you can get in cheap would indeed make it faster.

Since the financial crisis, I think money being so "cheap" (i.e. low interest, QE, etc) it just makes any dip short-lived because money doesn't have anywhere to go, making any discount appetizing. As an accumulator and trying to stay as close to 100% invested as possible, it indeed sucks a bit.

It seems possible that less opportunities to buy dips makes retirement longer, but it's hard to say what to do about that.  For instance, I choose an asset allocation of 80/20, and something I've started to do on these dips is to pick some targets to do immediate rebalancing (so in March I did this twice with \~2-3% of my portfolio.)  So in some way I was able to capture some benefit by doing this.  But since this is already part of my investment strategy, the only real adjustment is to do some dynamic rebalancing (and to be very honest, not very scientifically.)

But is there any way to do this when your target is a 100% stock allocation?  Could you prove some sort of valuation-based stock/bond allocation that would allow you to make a big stock purchase in the future, but remain invested?  To be honest, I think people have been asking these questions for decades, it's nothing new.  And they run into the same problems -> complicated ideas that pass a backtest often fail on implementation.

[https://www.marottaonmoney.com/does-past-performance-have-anything-to-do-with-future-results/](https://www.marottaonmoney.com/does-past-performance-have-anything-to-do-with-future-results/)

Recent returns (year to year) don't show much correlation either, and any valuation-based trends have long poles - i.e. CAPE research may indicate low 10 year returns are likely at these levels but ten years is a long time to wait for a market crash if you intend to hold cash.

TL;DR - conditions may make reaching retirement an uphill climb but it's hard to find a strategy that might take advantage of this in the moment.
Yeppp saw that. Up 7%!!!  Hopefully that means good things coming tomorrow too.  Gap-up to $45-50??? üëÄ

Looks like a large buy went through at 5:19 that pumped it initially, been climbing since.
Seems like a combination of:

Recent contracts and innovation, expected settlement announcement on their FB lawsuit, and a bit of a short squeeze.

> Nobody crazy enough to sell gme calls uncovered is here I hope.

its not crazy, sell an option at 45. If it comes close, just buy to cover, if it falls, sell at 44. Elsewise, people are buying puts, selling a call is the same as buying a put. It's not just the options today that need to be covered mind you. There was also large purchases for all the following dates. We just added a big block of options that werent available previously.

After today I dont know if I can afford to buy them back.  Killing me how much money I am leaving on the table.... if I would have bought them back end of yesterday I would be $31.5 richer (after already loosing out on $39k).  It is mooning after hours now even more.  Only redeeming grace is I do have a bunch of calls that I am holding onto worth about $100k not including after hours. Would this be considered gain points and loss porn at the same time?

They invent new enzymes through directed evolution (2018 Chemistry Nobel Prize). Pharma companies pay them royalties to use their platform, and when they invent a new enzyme (takes about three days to do a billion years of evolution) they get to share patent rights. A really remarkable business model with high profile pharma companies (Merck, Novartis, etc...) licensing their tech. Don't be fooled by their website, environmentalism is not the point here, just a small fringe benefit.  


Fuck the DD though. Basically you can get rich by buying a stock that proves evolution exists. So next time your shitty uncle gets you upset saying evolution isn't real, dry your tears with sweet sweet tendies.

"Data analysts" will just become generic STEM people, including those currently in marketing or business development.

My prediction is that it will stop being a technical role. 

I don't think full automation of analytics is possible, but the cost can be lowered significantly.

Imagine all the analytics work that is being done at Amazon last mile logistics optimization, Uber ride optimization, Lime scooter placement optimization, Doordash delivery optimization.

All of these companies are fighting over top analyst talent to build out the geospatial optimization logic, INDEPENDENTLY. Imagine if one company that was able to share best practices between all of these organizations. They could do BETTER and CHEAPER.

The exchange is the controller, yes. But this is only because the default controller would be the manager/creator/minter of the currency however since BTC is decentralized there is no way to moderate any policies or core functionality of BTC, making the next point of control the exchanges which I mentioned later in the comment. 

I addressed your point earlier on re: forcing exchanges to do X, it ultimately is skirted without much effort by foreign operated exchanges that suffer no consequence to allowing US users to break their own laws and exchanges that exist entirely decentralized, much like BTC.

How do you have to cover selling a put? I've seen this twice on here.

If you sell a put you collect premium. The price goes up so you keep the premium and don't have to buy the shares.

Hahahaha BB!
I'm not arguing that it's profitable right now. Also, apologies on me saying Blue Origin, I meant Boeing.

It's called investing in the future. Those who have the way now have claim to everything in the future. These companies will be the only ones capable of accessing literally everything beyond Earth. Your view is too shortsighted. Just because they won't make profit this year, doesn't mean they don't make profit within 20 years. Their value will skyrocket within 20 years and those who got in early will reap the rewards like the internet boom.

Believe what you want, I'm in the industry myself and was skeptical at first, but I know the countless ways that space companies can make money. Hundreds of millions alone are poured into space just for FARMERS to get pictures of their crops and farm land. That's just one of thousands of uses for satellites and space technology. Keep being pessimistic, but stop pretending their isn't value. If there wasn't value we wouldn't be pouring in billions. Rich people don't spend their money because they like eating money, they do it because they want to make more money and it may be long-term, but it will pay off and even more for the people that don't have to put in the upfront cost but can get in early and reap the rewards later.

When did you sell for this 50% profit though?  If you did it this week then good on you.   If you did it in April 2020 after the low of March an then sold and missed out on the massive run up then well that is a different thing.   I always wonder when people who did own, sell, and then miss out on a run up if they are more apt to be irrationally negative.   It is something that I have seen quite a bit over the years.    People want to justify their own moves.   If they sell and find out they missed out on a bunch of upside I have seen people get pretty nasty about the company they used to own and like.    They tell themselves it is a bubble or make other excuses.  Not saying that you are like this.   Just something that I have observed.
Oh I see, so you were selling a call option while holding the underlying asset, that it? Good profit anyways man GG
What's in it for me?
What is this? This isnt robinhood?
Guys how do sell walls work during ah? Do they still trigger or do they trigger at open?
who shops at gamestop
Dark theme at night would be highly appreciated
Back from my witch hunt, totally a hoax ban
Meanwhile I've made 30 bucks in a month with $120 put in
I think it is indiscriminate. People are starving for assets to avoid dollar depreciation. People are buying despite stupid p/e because what else will they do? 

It's gonna correct, but when? Falling knives and all that.
Yes
Up 15% ah
Get outta here bot
I stopped reading after woman‚Äôs intuition

Blackrock needs to rebalance. Too much plug
I was born in the right household. It's not a merit. But yeah, my chilhood was ez mode.
Hahaha literally has no idea I was up this much I was playing 2k cuz I‚Äôm autistic
So, since the highest strike call for tomorrow is at USD 40... if we keep this price level does that mean that every single open call for tomorrow will get exercised?
Is there a chance GME dilutes some if it‚Äôs shares because of this run up?
GET WEBULL FAM
Hey is LGO and LGORF same company?
Idk economics. But yes cost go up while consumer spending should go up too
Who will break $100 first? GME or AMD lol
How did you borrow from 401k?
Buy shares
If BB is a  software company and PLTR is also a  software company the price target for BB should be at least 25$

Trust me im an analyst (and kinda retarded)
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ tomorrow
Is it too late for BB or GME. Never done this before. Tell me what to do boys.

Pretty much, yes.
So what car y‚Äôall fucktards buying tmrw?
the MEN on this sub
Sooooo how‚Äôs GME
Plus stimmy news just hit. I'm buying more calls at open. This thing is gone.
There is a cash collateral for the value of security sitting in the lending account so for whatever reason they cannot, I would assume I would get the cash. It never happened though.
serious answer: If the buyout is an all-cash deal, shares of your stock will disappear from your portfolio at some point following the deal's official closing date and be replaced by the cash value of the shares specified in the buyout. If it is an all-stock deal, the shares will be replaced by shares of the company doing the buying.
Well I‚Äôm sending him pictures of my asshole then just to let him know it can be his

I feel like AMC could be insane if they don't get bankrupt. But the timing might be hard to get down.
GME to $90? crazier things have happened..
Buy with limit orders or this will happen
This is one of those ‚Äúgoing to get worse before it gets better‚Äù scenarios. It will get worse one of two ways - 1. You don‚Äôt make a new account and continue with the anxiety of having your mother watch your every financial move until you do at which point 2. You get fed up and make your own account which she will eventually figure out and freak out about. Basically this only ends in her finding out, you‚Äôre just choosing now or later. You could talk to her about it and work out some sort of system where you essentially keep the joint as a savings with a financial cushion and then operate daily out of your sole ownership account. 

I‚Äôm sorry to say though that you‚Äôre eventually going to have to stop letting her ‚Äúinsist‚Äù on things in your life. As long as you keep her in the loop and act like an adult about it, things may actually be fine, if not a bit uncomfortable for a while.
Haha yeah. Either way tendies for us amirite. All about knowing when exactly that perfect top is before the squeeze is over. Thanks for the info.
Big Bags
When is lockup over? I'll buy whatever is getting dumped. I need 450 more shares to hit my goal of 1000 for the year. If I can get in under 20 again I'd be so happy, and I'd probably double up to 2000 by eoy
Really hoping BYND gives another good run tomorrow
GREAT IDEA! Thanks!
Yo. I struggled to break my ATH of 67% and now in AH I‚Äôm over 100% all-time.

Shout out to WSB and fuck Melvin (boomer ass name anyway) all my homies hate Melvin.
GM is to boomer, it'll be CCIV  with the Lucid merger.
It's one of the great long term stocks. The crashes are when you reinvest dividends back into the company. When the stock is expensive you put the dividend income to work in other stocks.

Any thoughts on GHIV currently bagholding til merger vote, hopefully PSTH hast popped by then.
For real? That's fucked. I don't want google to have my workout and sleep data.
This is what I got from raiding news articles and press releases. Their tech is supposed to be better than competition and deliver better taste. Hence why they got the grant and the patents. Single use plastics are coming to an end in Canada. We already seeing it in grocery stores on East coast and Ontario. The ceo seems to be very optimistic they can get box retail.
Is tomorrow gonna be the day of absolute madness?
Nice. I finally recouped my losses from last month with this little guy. Lots of room to grow with this one especially with a blue senate. LFG!
im the only data point i have. I don't know if theres a way to see how many people traded the same asset twice. Probably a breach of privacy.
Last time we had short squeezes like this was last June and we crashed pretty hard

There was a 95k at 40 that got blown up.

So does everyone think the market will open up tomorrow or down? 
I basically have no downside protection
Robinhood
Y‚Äôall are welcome for the GME boost, I bought a PS4 gift card yesterdayüöÄ
you got that F U Money now?
This AH GME action has got to be shorts covering and reselling to other shorts. There‚Äôs no other explanation lol
It's time to start using a bank account for gain or losses, so I know how to stop it.

TLDR wholesale price on the exchange was down to 0.18 yen per kWh when the weather was nice back in November 2020. Demand for electricity used for heating and air conditioning was low.  Solar generation was high.  

Compared to the current situation, the market demand, price for LNG, and renewable output are very volatile in Japan.
Buy calls.
As a holder of 100 $4 NOK 2023 LEAPS. Its the float that worries me. It takes a true force of retard strength to move 5 Billy shares
Look how fast everything came back from March (most things). Amazing companies (for no reason at all other than fear) were at HUGE discounts. It depends on your risk tolerance and if you trust your research. If there is a crash I'll be moving some cash around to get the companies I believe in at a discount. But who knows if/when a crash will happen, if you have done your research you should be able to sleep easy... If you haven't, I suggest starting now and then making your decision.
You are doing more in one day with one of your two lines than I'll do in a life!
GME giveth
Ah fuck. Did he sell his 1/15C today? I was DFV handsing mine until he sold. Shit hahaha
It almost doesn‚Äôt feel real
Why am I so scared of a selloff tomorrow, continuing into next week? Was this week a false breakout? Will the Biden speech(es) be a sell the news event? Are the MMs going to drop the bag on retail? *is* a blue wave bullish? This feels awfully similar to the Labor Day correction.... might sell everything tomorrow morning. Oh shit I almost forgot - GME üöÄüöÄ

5. You have next to your stick portfolio other cash available?
When GME is fully bought, it‚Äôs then mexicain standoff between holders until one sell triggering a collapse?
victory isnt guaranteed, dont be afraid to claim profits commensurate to the risk youve undertaken.
So I am not sure the tax rules of other countries ; in the USA dividends are taxable.

Oh. My. God. GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
But be aware that if a stock really plummets ur trailing stop loss may trigger but the price isnt guarnteed, your broker will fill it at the best available price. That could be lower then the price u set. Just depends on the buy and sell bids.
Can't believe I missed this üôÑ
Holding BB till 69.
It honestly depends on the price, I would like for all of us to hold so the shorters get f\*cked as they will hold till the end possibly.

If you head that way, just make sure you act like $2.50/month is a big deal. Otherwise they'll spot you.
Gotta wait for 2nd bill..
why BB though... :D i mean i fomoed in already with 600 ‚Ç¨ but if its serious i can fomo in much more\^\^
Dear lord, why am I such a pussy? Why did I only buy 10K worth of GME positions at close? Why did I not buy more 43 calls expiring tomorrow (only bought 5 and they're already ITM)? Oh well GME to the moon üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ
GME teasing after hours. Will my 55c 1/15 print?
Sure they are. All are geared to provide income streams. Comparable, but not the same. If you look at most income funds, they are comprised of all 3. And many people buy bonds for diversification.
1/15 43c. Please save my portfolio
My head says it was good decision making pulling out of 1/15 GME at the high point but my heart says wow this rally makes me wish I didn't. Oh well still have shares and april calls
Damn I dumped my shares too early lol. Sold at around 8.8 to 9

Still have a handful of leaps tho

Dear Oracle. What's your PT on PLTR.
ü•∫
This will be over a year at least. Possibly 3 or more
Just check the boxes and click the buttons.  Nothing to it.
Yeah, first big win in a while. Initial investment of 6k, pulled out 19k so far, with 30k still on the table. I want to hold but I've been down this road too many times at this point and know that parabolic gains usually lead to huge drops, hence my interest in hedging some of that risk. 

I might pick up some puts for next week too, but I think that if your thesis plays out then 0-day puts will hedge me better with less capital.
Idk if Apple is selling that stuff since I do have a Apple Watch but thought that was weird on my personal email.
that‚Äôs still not manipulation, that‚Äôs just a large ass sell order
yep... I just keep buying and selling.. for the stuff to always keep mooning. Was in since $6. In and out :( guh lol
How much volume in GME ah?
What does 44k sell wall mean?
Yo can I have some I need to fix my teeth
Cramer keeps trying to coax an offering from GME. Which side are you on, bro?! ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always a bull market somewhere, my job is to find it for you!‚Äù. We found it! Stay away!
Without limit order it can charge me more than the stock is worth??

It says my cost was $3.13 cad but the stock never has bit that price
I‚Äôm going allllllll in tomorrow üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ not missing this shit
You son of a bitch, you sons of bitches really broke wall street. SEC is probably finding a way on how to break us up.

You could buy 32 shares of GME with that.
Also it has like three 5% days in a row. Today was 7.5%
I think you mean $69,420

A fraction of a share , which app you using that isn't robinhood?
actually lol'd when i refreshed and saw the GME AH price. moon mission, lets go
Considering the current economic situation - covid measures still being in place, FED printing money like crazy... I think that you can chill for at least one or 2 more years. When the printing stops, interest rates go up and reality sinks in, then it might be a good idea to sell.
Guys I have breaking news.

I just bit into a Lindt truffle and it had no filling.

Bear market confirmed.
I became a millionaire last year, but since it didn‚Äôt sneak up on me overnight it maybe wasn‚Äôt as exciting as one might‚Äôve expect. Who am I kidding it‚Äôs the bees kneez

Theta for this option is like .039 where do you get off at spreading this misinformation?
GME ATH AH...no idea where this is gonna go tomorrow...
Don‚Äôt speak of such things
Boomer machines.
Why is it going to Rocket at open?
Theyre doing it. Almost at 43...
GME is teaching all paper handed cucks a lesson
Dude are you kidding me? Have I ever betrayed your trust?
I guess it was cool that The order to  sell 30 of them before close didn‚Äôt go through lol
Nope!
We already got the $600 last week.
Is this r stocks or wsb cause all these idiots sound autistic. There's nothing wrong with losing money. It happens. The people who shout "bull market, I dk fundamentals, etc but I made money" are not investors. They're gambling and unfortunately now is the time that gambling pays big, especially if you blindly buy calls and bet upwards. Now is not the time for investors, wait until the next correction (20-30%) and consider investing if other factors suggest it's time as well. Most of these idiots will be wiped out when a rug pull happens like in March and wsb goes on suicide watch because two red days wiped out 5 months of s&p gains.
500*
Or just FOMO from accounts trading in extended hours.
Dip hard next week, that's your entry
I wasn't even born at that time and now I'm flying to the moon.üöÄüåù
Weed stocks. TLRY up 23.57%; APHA up 21.10% on surprise earnings beat (and also the first time in eons the stock hasn‚Äôt nosedived after ER), both are up currently AH. Major gains across the cannabis sector.
i bought gme 5 years ago and im finally 50% up. Thanks guys, was worth the wait
My boy used it. Was cool to have so much radio for hip hop to switch through and sounds fire.
I wish I could see the Ocugen chart, wonder how many bag holders are sitting there with me
Fitbit shareholders in shambles. Their money just vanished. ü™Ñ
Fuck Melvin
Shit I hope we all make it man
The total of the new calls is 92k again
FB and BABA are literally too cheap rn 

If you have 10k just throw it in these leaps
55c 1/15's sold for .59 right before close. Is it better to sell at open or set a limit at something higher (or lower)? Bought at .35 earlier in the day to catch a spike but phone died for a few hours away from a charger and I missed the $2+ window.
ONLY bags GME folks gonna be holdin is a birkin 

Yktv
Why?
FOMO... cause we got the squeeeezee on our side. We then drop the bag onto Hedge Funds
Fuckin cramer
FYI $REAL has popped ~50% since this comment bro
DIX out for Harambe
You think the earnings are gonna be positive? I mean I'm probably gonna sell before anyways but will the price recover in time? The AMD options premiums are relatively cheap rn. I paperhanded my last AMD option though (1/22 92C) and ran off with a $25 profit.
Hit 55 and you can get a sick hotel
he sold them
As a caddy in high school I got to golf for free on Mondays when the club was closed. One of the best private golf courses in the country, and I never would have had the chance otherwise.
Uhhhh. I buy green and sell red. Am I doing it wrong?
why would he ever exercise them if he could just sell the calls and buy the stock and keep the option premium?
He'll probably say ACES just out of old man habit, and we'll all be ironically fucked 

Like... "That's just ACES!"
You missed GME didn‚Äôt you?
Thoughts on WOOF and PLUG tomorrow?
Don‚Äôt get distracted autists, BB is our next moon mission üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ=>üåì
Most of these companies are r&d clean energy. If you really want to save the world just keep pumping ICLN and Plug like the rest of us idiots.
I bought at .23 so if it hits $3 I‚Äôd make $3900 out of $69 and immediately turn that $3900 into CCIV calls
*when you have .07 tesla stonks*
And there you have it folks. Jesus himself aka the one true king of WSB has spoken
Yeah that's the secret once you are awarded the contract and they're using your software makes it really hard to change the future without a complete rework
Oops, my mistake
Not like some of you whales, but life changing. Student loans gone...
If overthinking was a post
Very nice.
This isn't correct. You can exercise options on margin and sell instantly. You might have to call your broker to handle that transaction but you don't need the cash to exercise if you don't use a shit broker. 

I have exercised 500k+ in Tesla calls overnight before
gratz!

My full-time job is just a side hustle at this point. I just made enough to pay rent while sleeping in this morning. Showed up to work 2 hours late and clocked in 8 an 8 hour shift before leaving early.
Are we supposed to hold gme for tmro? New to this lol
I think the most important not that how much or he could just put in an index. He learned in the process, researched, watch YouTube that my friend more value than your $100 which is a bonus. Keep educating yourself
Epic.
the original question is literally about retired people
43.00
Long Live BB
Will it dip? Absolutely, at market open when all the Melvin boomers (and paper hands panic) so they can cover their puts for a bit cheaper. But once they start covering it will skyrocket like how Tesla would jump up in the final hours of trading
hold through the weekend üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I‚Äôll see you at ~29$ at open lol
This has to be one of the more cringeworthy attempts at a mental flex I've seen on here...
yeah but they need to be available. im trying to research his question right now. I think SEC decides but i need to confirm.
GME is going to start an insurrection here when it comes time to sell
this is the way
Seriously though I think it was an all cash offer for like $7.35 a share.. so you‚Äôll probably get that per share
the stonk market
I‚Äòm in with view hundred stocks / Entry at 16,23$ so well in the Green ‚òòÔ∏è But my Question is can someone give me advice for a save call option on GME what I can add tomorrow? I‚Äòm not so into Option trading but this stock would be a great first timer... so I‚Äôm greatfull for advice üôè
Wait blackberry still exists
ARKG Calls gonna print heavily tomorrow.
I am rock hard right now
Anyone else glued to this thread due to GME üöÄ craziness?
It‚Äôs about to blow up. You haven‚Äôt missed it
That GME yolo deserves every penny. Diamond handed through the worst pandemic in modern history, didn't sell yesterday and held on till the very last minute. 

LEGEND
Blackberry? More like BlackBURYmydickinallthesegains!! 

I UPGRADE $BB WITH A $300 PT
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Almost all ETFs I looked at lept AH. Don‚Äôt know why but that‚Äôs ok with me
Lol fomoed into gme at 42.9$ and bought 2 50c 1/15 those might actually print ey?
But then no gas for the lambos :(
If GME gaps up another 20% tomorrow morning, I think the shorts will start to get very scared and we will start to see the squeeze really kick in.
Where are you watching?
Accidentally gave 2 gold, am i retarded enough for this sub yet?
I‚Äôve been sitting a little below 10g‚Äôs for a few days now. Every day I think ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs the day!‚Äù But it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Maybe tomorrow
Savage - might try your style tomorrow
In for 2000 shares. I was expecting things to pop today with the stimulus announcement, now I just feel retardrd.
HYSR be looking juicy. Put 15k in and I‚Äôm up 61% ü•∞
I still have a couple 42c's expiring next week though
GME $43.00 post market
And I you, my little dust ball.
I think you could get an estimate on [optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://optionsprofitcalculator.com) by putting in the AH share price but it won't be 100% accurate
to the FUCKING moon baby
Hyberbolic Tan is a stock?
Even if you‚Äôre scared to buy options, you have no excuse for not buying gme shares while in the midst of a short squeeze. Yeah I‚Äôm taking to you
I sold 60 to cover day trade margin Bought back in, forgive me father for I have sinned
Uranium, steel, weed, solar, wind, military will all benefit imo
Someone turn this into a movie. Most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Why? Not in the US?
Too bad he sold 2/3 of his position in 2020 during the run up
Please never post that horrible video again. 

I'm cool with BB tho!!
 Codexis CDXS

Call 3/19 @ 26.00

They invent new enzymes through directed evolution (2018 Chemistry Nobel Prize). Pharma companies pay them royalties to use their platform, and when they invent a new enzyme (takes about three days to do a billion years of evolution) they get to share patent rights. A really remarkable business model with high profile pharma companies (Merck, Novartis, etc...) licensing their tech. Don't be fooled by their website, environmentalism is not the point here, just a small fringe benefit.

Fuck the DD though. Basically you can get rich by buying a stock that proves evolution exists. So next time your shitty uncle gets you upset saying evolution isn't real, dry your tears with sweet sweet tendies.

All of my holdings are in the stock and I have calls expiring in March so obviously I'm just a dumb fucking shill trying to pump my own shit.
Long weed
Yes
Please see wiggz if I am wrong about this!
What‚Äôs the PT on BB?
We should lock our subreddit
Not too late. Squeeze just getting started on both. It will take a while for shorts to fully cover
It just started today you didn‚Äôt miss anything I‚Äôm getting in tomorrow!
What about Xiaomi, made a 13% loss today?
im actually so surprised you morons pulled this off fuck melvin hes a fuckin nerd
That first question was a freebie. Further questions contribute to my stocks. (You can easily Google the answer to your question about net gains and taxes for 2021.)
Negative subscriber growth is going to be real and it‚Äôs going to crush this stock.  They might need to start charging a fee for use of their left wing echo chamber.
I at least generally know what I'm doing most of the time but I have no Idea when I should get out of this position.

Will you pleas GOD tell us when you think it's time to exit and give us a heads up?
Anyone else riding CIIG?  +11% today. Merging Q1
GME, BBBY, and BB are all mooning lmaooo, it feels like 2003 out here.
We don‚Äôt talk about that lol
What % gain do u close out at

Amen brother, sold immediately this morning an transfered to bb an gme. Thank god
Yes, hold and watch the ticker!
‚ÄúThe autists who broke Wall Street‚Äù
Trying to spook folks into selling probably. 

We. Aint. Fucking. Selling.
GME share dilution might be off the table now that Mr. Chewy is on the ship. Why would he dilute himself
If it reaches 100 lmao I‚Äôm going to bust the largest nut üòÇüí¶üí¶üí¶
Dude how the fuck are you down on ICLN ? Did you buy for the first time last week or something because the week chart is the only one that‚Äôs red
Bout to?
Ah, nice!  That's unusual, and I hope it's well-managed.  In that situation, I wouldn't count it towards FI until I got closer and knew that I'd be able to collect.
Fun hobbies that produce cash at your own leisure is always the way to go for OPs idea imo.
Retailers always find a way to profit, less stores, probably a shift onto their online sales

What makes you think the new administration will continue down this path?
If you go back to the trade options page, to the left of the dates you should see a tab that says "Discover"


I recommend clicking that and reading through the Robinhood info they provide on that page and then watching a few Youtube videos.


I've read countless reddit posts/comments about options trading but what really helped me was seeing others do it via a video and then making some low risk ones myself.
keep holding it to at least 100
Fr. We just gettin starting tho
Actually, if I find some old notes from when I learned from this or something it might be fun to do a couple case studies for new folks.

Like here is where that stock was first mentioned, here is the catalyst, here is when it was actually upvoted at all, here's the hype, here's the news, here the most people own it and continue to as the price goes in the gutter...
GME hitting 50 tomorrow ong
Yessir
Weedstocks to look at: WMD, TLRY, CURA, APHA!!
I feel like the outcast kid at the party sitting in a corner alone, drinking my PLTR, while every kid is busting it to the GME beats and having fun.
when does the next president speak?
You bought $40 calls after the stock doubled in two days? It looks like it‚Äôs doing good post market but that doesn‚Äôt mean shit. Assuming it doesn‚Äôt dip tomorrow, I‚Äôd sell them ASAP before they expire worthless
How can someone own the broker money? You buy the call and pay beforehand right? Worst case its all gone, right?
anyone got a link to the interview?
Sure did, choo choo!!
Portfolio diversity: 100% üòÇüòÇüòÇ
GME making moves. Remember DON'T SELL. HOLD.
Discloser: 3769 shares at $32.6. Would have bought more but I literally can't (company's trading window is closed for a few more weeks and that's where most of my money is).
What yall think about FIVRR?
üëä
Make GMGI the next GME
same as yesterday around 200k
How much am I gonna make from my $10.5 feb 5 BB calls tomorrow? 1000% üòÇ?
Thanks, I see it now. I think I last checked yesterday and 40 was the max strike. It does look that OI on the higher strike calls (above 40) is basically nonexistent.
Whooo!

Who do we attack next!
Should we seriously still be buying at $42?
Holy shit BB was the play of the day?

Also, can‚Äôt wait to get my hands on the Nintendo wii you guys!
hahah thanks. the dream is 2 mil in a 2.5% aristocrat portofoilo. easy life after that.
Why isn't the story ever "We fucked up and missed this great investment."?
How the fuck are shorts not completely out of GME yet. Talk about fucking üíé ü§ö

Fucking robin hoods deposit limit screwed me. I would've dumped so much more into bb and gme today
It worked üíØ
Its a very good time
Yeah if you are intending to sell the shares, you can also consider ‚Äúsell to close‚Äù the option itself. If you are in the money, meaning you are set to make a profit, the value of the option will increase in value.

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/sell-open-buy-close-buy-open-sell-close-mean/
DONT SELL GME!! KEEP BUYING SHARES AND CALLS AND WE WILL SEE 50 TOMORROW
Don't fucking pay taxes then dumbass. Just sleep for a whole year smh
good luck... to both of us

i may join you long if it plays out and pukes tomorrow.

Thanks for your input! Truly appreciated
Definitely
Why
Not a chance. There was a stupid amount of short the last 2 days. Very little unwinding.
That's great, I'll look further into them, appreciate the detailed info. üëç

Thanks!
Yeah but DFV took Burry's position after it was public knowledge.
I finally understand what you meant the whole time.  Thanks for the effort, appreciated.  

Them Feb 55c are looking real cheap right now. Yum.

I was looking just now, I‚Äôm short a 19 put expiring tomorrow, üòÇ
Dad!! The DNA results are in.
GME 420 BB 69
correct every 3 months then blast off again?
hey that's my grandfather's name please respec
I got burned today, going to ponder over how to next proceed.

It's a learning experience though, hopefully I'll do better next time.
It's been a bull run for a bit. Hard times are ahead at some point; I just can't see it at the moment, especially with Dems in the WH and House. Country about to take on even more debt but that's a longterm issue. 

Before you get some misconceptions though. Retirement isn't necessarily financial independence. But it's a big enough cushion were you can stand up at work, tell your boss to fuck off, then walk out. 

It's also the ability to work doing something you enjoy without doing it solely for the paycheck.
Would love to see this too
Honestly, I think I'll take profits and put em into BB and APHA
The whole, ‚ÄòI had it hard so others should too,‚Äô attitude sucks. If I can stop a fellow investor from falling into a loss because I already learned the lesson, why wouldn‚Äôt I help unless I was just generally bitter?
I‚Äôm with you
Paper handed bitches deserve it. 45 open tomorrow
They seem risk averse, yet never cut a good profit when they can. I don't really understand their thinking and it seems like a lot of them don't into stonks either.
No shame, that theta on a 1dte is horrific
7pm est
üåàüêª in shambles
This is all I can afford for... Now! Once it's moon I will be able to join future gains!
Mods aint great here. Most were for silly things. Talked about a magic mushroom pharma stock on the OTCs by name. Talked about president's economic plans b4 election (never said who to vote for) and experts opinions on the plans. Posted a picture someone made of mango and putin kissing. And then talked abput drama from another sub +prob the only thing I think that might deserve a ban)
Yes
Looking good on GME and BB after hours
I like your energy
600 + 1400 = 2000
BB üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Post market lol
WSB made it onto wallstreet journal we did it guys
There is going to be at least one red or flat day for GME. Their last ER says they filed for the option to sell $100MM worth of shares at some point and they will want their bonuses.
idk not sure if we should be on board with personal harassment

The Bond movie was supposed to come out in the Spring of last year, then was moved to November, then was moved to April 2021 and now looks to be moving to November 2021. Movie theaters may get through this, but business in gradual decline imo.  If things don't get better by the Spring and Fast and the Furious and everything else has to get moved *again*, then the theater companies are going to have to face some major problems.
I was extra retarded and bought 38C on the dip just before market close.  In retrospect, a terrible decision, but it might pay off
Bought calls expiring right after earning for the sole purpose of selling on the run up. Same with MSFT and WMT
ü§ù
YOLO 500 more into GME?
Hmm. I did actually go there last week for the first time in over a year to buy a controller.

Ended up walking out cause 2 retard husband and wife from backwoods Arkansas couldn't remember their phone number and were taking 20 minutes, all while shit talking the last guy that had tried to help them.

I dont have that kind of patience
because its easier to buy shares when they cover
this is sick and all but I keep thinking about how jpow literally shut down the idea of raising interest rates anytime soon earlier today

then he said who gives a fuck about inflation

lmao printers go brrrr
Its definitely going to 50$ tomorrow because I sold fds for a little theta action ü§°
Has the GME squeeze squozen?
Same here, I know east transfers. But the fees and software is ruining me. 2k+ down the drain in just a couple months guh.
this is the greatest play in the history of plays
Sure but I am new also so this will be good.  

$9 is the strike price which means I am buying the right to buy those shares at $9 should the option expire ITM (In The Money).  

2/12 is the expiration date of the contract which means we want to be ITM at that time and either sell before then or exercise (purchase) the shares.
BB at open tmr ? or too late
buy high sell low, you‚Äôre doing fine
I'll take one from the company in the movie 'Moon'
Can this be done using a Questrade trading account?

Are these calls gonna print tmrw
So you decide to go all in on a meme stock in option....
My company cancelled raises this year (I got one because I‚Äôm that good). Then we had our annual end of the year ‚Äúluncheon‚Äù and they keep going on and on about how great we‚Äôre doing this year despite the pandemic.

Absolute cunts. They‚Äôre just using COVID as an excuse not to pay us.
Cant go tits up. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Thats when I entered, I remember it popped back up to 8 or so briefly between all the halts, I added more through May/June once it resumed for 10002 shares at 2.71 avg,. Im holding long, def a big yolo position for me.
15$ minimum wage? How is McDonald‚Äôs suppose to keep my breakfast burritos cheap?
Total agree on GRWG. See why it‚Äôs going to üí• https://link.medium.com/uUKwDWW92cb
I get what you mean.

Some amazing long term stocks to get in right now.
And you wouldn't have to do anything..
But day trading and seeing them gains straight away.

And theres some huge gains to be made sometimes very quickly
probably what I will be doing now.....just bought 100 at 10.52 after hours, already down
Where is the tard that said he‚Äôd tattoo his ass if GME opened at 50$?!

GME is a beast
vale bros, we reached 19
7est i think
Got it boss
Jumped in $300 BB 10$ C 3/19 and $600 worth of 1/29 PLTR 25C. So far 1/2.
PRCH way underpriced IMO. Porch. Com

Great name and has actual revenue. Market cap only 1 billion. 

This was a SPAC

up 70 percent already. Could easily go double again.
$BB if you‚Äôve already rode GME
I'm all in! 

Uh, how big of a pack should I grab and do you recommend going cans or bottles?

Looks like those are shares he sold short. 47k. If on margin, he could owe

They aren't being saved. They are switching their entire company to be a software (to include cybersecurity company) which drastically changes their valuation. Also, they're partnered with Amazon now too.
I opened up a $10 1/22 call 6 hours ago thinking I would miss the boat and it's up 200% already
And where tlry ends up
i yolo‚Äôd 10 contracts of 3/19 $15c today because of the hype. love u boys
too late to get in?
If they have something big planned and  no cash to fund it, they will have to sell shares. And since the stock has fucking tripled it'd be pretty dumb for them not to

I'm doing him a favor
Why am I in this shitty fucking IPOE. Fuck you chamath
if you think about, it's kinda insane how GME hasn't had an offering yet... it's almost like they don't want to raise cash and expand lmao. Then again, it might be vested interest as RC has like 20% of GME and is on the board
TSLA pleas fly again tomorrow

He shouldn‚Äôt be investing wow
Not saying it won‚Äôt boom but it‚Äôs not very scalable.
what calls to buy tomorrow - BB calls??
I mean who can fucking argue with results
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
GME giveth and GME takes :( hopefully it giveth more
Somebody has an order to sell 44k shares at 43. So at least 44k+1 shares need to be purchased at 43 for it to go higher. It‚Äôs often done in an effort to keep the price down (or up with a buy wall)
Just followed you. Congrats by the way. Now kiss me.
There are a million of these stories, you just have to move on.  I have a hundred of them myself.
Both
I gotta sleep on my back otherwise this GME üöÄüöÄ is gonna get in the way
I work in the automotive sensor market = directly with multiple large OEMS.

I see nothing unique OR valuable Blackerry/AWS is offering.

OEM's have already begun heavily investing in these type of sensor information interfaces.

That being said, I just purchased 200 shares.
It‚Äôs being pinned to 380. Maximum pain. Lots of contracts expire tomorrow
OMG, I did not realize until now that making funds go under was on my bucketlist. GME!
You put the buy order on the 5th in the screenshot? It probably went through at the time but for whatever reason didn't show up til 7th- sorry, not familiar with the platform you're using.

On the 5th;
[](https://i.imgur.com/uYev4kE.png)
The classic of sell low and buy high. Oof
honestly might be 50 at pre-market opening tomorrow
Both wtf
The shorts covering after hours for when it pumps the next day, thats when they sell and you see the dips then midday they rinse and repeat.
Thanks! this is awesome and I made a move in part based on this this week.  Could we get constant posts on this? There's so much to keep track of and the vast majority of us are not full time traders.  But if we all did like 1 hour of DD a week like this together we'd crush it
How do I invest right now. Won't I have to wait to transfer from my bank to an account. Will it be too late
...scrolling lyrics would help. 

but if this is conformation bias, I approve.
Nope! Just a little pre-squeeze goin on right now...
GME join the cause
If this news is released tomorrow but we buy the stocks now in after hours, is this insider trading?
I start shorting after short squeezes. It's like buying after a crash.
I know we only have eyes for GME right now (and rightfully so) but ARKG SPCE and TLRY are looking pretty nice in after hours, too
The KING is gonna literally be able to afford a kingdom after this. Complete with a castle, drawbridge, and a pillory for all the Melvin shorts
They already make pretty good money honestly.
Buying
You're not arguing in good faith.

I'm trying to help describe what an exponential opportunity curve looks like.

Not cool
Wish I just followed my own advice on YOLO all on jan 15C 2021 Calls... hope that retard I told  like 3 months ago to get them is swimming in trendies.

Holy shit, this is gold. Buying more PLTR at open. Thanks for the DD.
I don't think even GameStop will offer Plotkin more than tree fiddy for his prolapsed anus.
So why are we excited for BBBY? BB and GME are gold, but it seems like the ship has already sailed for that one.
I missed the GME moon so hard. I paper handed like a bitch last Friday and I deserve every bit of shame. I won't even delete my old posts so I can remind myself of what being a paper handed bitch gets me (or rather doesn't get). So to make up for it, I'm going full retard and YOLO-ing hard into BB and I ain't touching it until January of next year. All other income shall go into NIO until their CEO "disappears".
Aye the last one bought me the parts for a sick ar pistol!
Thanks! Yeah, I will definitely look into cryptocurrencies and related fin-tech and get a (small) exposure to those assets.
Yes
we should lock up the sub. better have more quality than quantity. some people literally dont know what calls are but buy them blindly.
Who is ‚Äúwe‚Äù?
it's ARKK
I feel you bro, my money is frozen in PLTR right now. Just gotta be patient though
Jesus fuck. How long did you hold?
In all honesty, what percentage of your portfolio do you hold as shares?? I‚Äôm trying to find a good balance where I can maintain some good positions but also try to make money with stupid options plays that will probably lose money.
you must be a true autist to believe that, that's the end of the $BB rocket. HOMIE WE DIDN'T TAKE OFF YET LMAO

What the fuck is a $PLTR. Doesn't look stonks to me.
I'd reduce AMZN by a lot, maybe to 10% of your portfolio. Maybe put the remaining 20% into QQQ or ARKK? 

If you only recently got into TSLA I'd reduce that as well - if you're sitting on massive gains that it's not as bad.
You‚Äôre one of them! Stay away.

For those of us coming from the front page, can somebody do an ELI5 with a timeline of how we got to this point? Did they need to have $780k sitting around to pull off this large of a return or did some of that price paid come from the earlier options profits? As presented it looks like the ROI is 6x over a year or two, which is phenomenal, but not unheard of. Hell, I have peloton stock that is up that much over a shorter time frame. Granted nowhere near that amount.

When you look into it it helps that Michael Burry did that research first and bought 3% of Gamestop.

I mean I can research stuff too if I have a hint that someone who is way better at investing than me is already headed that way.

Just made google alerts for Michael Burry and Scion Asset Management.
Profits don't disappear, you just pay more of a premium. instead of 100-5, you take home 100-9.

The only problem is if you paper hands out after it trades sideways for a week, or if it goes down.
This! Maybe the boys at Melvin are paying him. But seriously, GME already paid off some debt early and still has plenty of cash on hand. On top of that, they had a killer holiday sales report. Why offer now?
By the time this is over the 99 bubble gonna look like an anthill next to Everest . Nasdaq 20k EOY

Just donated my entire 2 weeks pay to BB so looks like it‚Äôs ramen noodles for dinner till the end of the months boys
Do you have a strategy for timing the top or just wing it?
Bought 100 shares, sold a covered call at 45 for tomorrow when it was 30 and bought more shares with the upfront cost but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs gonna cover lol
Can‚Äôt be. We will have back to back green days for this much money to get priced in.
Tough to say.  Do we even know how BB is pumping besides wsb ?
in few days/weeks there will be other retards like yourself saying: ‚ÄúBought stock for the very first time this week and now put 200 on GME @68. Don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm listening to you idiots but I‚Äôm on the train now‚Äù
Dude - I vaguely remember you from threads on which we discussed selling/buying KODK puts. Totally agree with you on implied vs realized vol on those options. On this trade I decided to take a position with you and buy some puts despite being very bullish long term on GME.
100% shares
I dont know if thai Stockholm is available om robinhood, p√• Fusion FUEL (HTOO) is a good play. Its widely known between Norwegians, and if we use the same multipels as NEL has, we see a 2200% upside in this one.

Yeah, Im not touching that one
Can the new meme be 1.8million Autists putting that stimmy into PLTR
I bet on an acca once and made an approx 50x return. It really is that easy. Of course, it‚Äôs also easy to lose. I guess the point here is that it luck means nothing.

We all know Buyden is turning the printer back on, guess the market just needs to hear it tonight.  Anyway, SPY $390 tomorrow ü•¥
not me sitting here thinking GME was gonna dip after yesterday.... jesus christ how is it $42
Gonna make it by the end of the day tmrw if this keeps up
A meme, a myth, a legend
Doubt it
I thought GME was too late yesterday. Bought two call contracts today anyway. Up $500 at close and with this AH gap up, its gonna be $1000 tomorrow. 

If you can buy AH, you should do it. BB is still cheap.. might as well go in

GME either going to the moon or crashing into hell tomorrow there's no middle ground

Buy some shares with the gains
Better add BB in there you stupid nut
YesüöÄüöÄüöÄ
We're not even close to the moon yet :)
Yeah the volume is pretty low and they cant do this quicker than at the very least two weeks which keeps premiums high. It is definitely a possible hedge tbh.
You guys see GME AH?
30% medium risk shares

20% high risk shares

50% options

This is what I do in my fun portfolio
I would hope that Cohen on the board shows that GME has shareholders interests in mind. Can you imagine the shunning if they had an offering.
No one can predict the future for you. Look back at the reasons why you invested in the first place and critique your research techniques. Learn from your past experiences and apply those lessons to future investments.
only risk about 10% of your portfolio with options. i mean if you are filthy rich and have high risk tolerance, then go for 70% lmao
Haha, I have positions in BBBY, GME, and BB.  What a weird few months it's been.
That‚Äôs way too bold. I rerolled my $265 September calls at a loss and added extra capital to get a call that was closer ITM

Unless baba hits $280 by February or close to it, ure probably gonna be in the red since the call will pretty much lose the rest of its intrinsic value just trying to get ITM in the last month

This isn‚Äôt even taking into account that if u ride the call to expiration, ure banking on baba being even higher than $280 just to break even on ur initial investment
Im holding about 80-85% shares and gambling the rest.. To be fair, most of those shares are Tesla
MJ 20c up 50% that expire in April.  I know weed stocks can be volatile but it was stupid.
Currently 2/12 $134C, 20 shares too.

Tomorrow I'll be settled and plan to sell a 1/22 put, one or two strikes ITM. If I'm not assigned I'll keep the premium and get myself to 100 shares. After earnings I'll sell a call and see if I can keep the income going.
Pltr isn't doing much
for everyone who doubted GME i hope you find a way to pay rent this month
The hidden scary time
RKT's contribution to my 2020 portfolio was integral to lowering my taxable gains lol

Well it better hurry the fuck up. My 3/19 $100 need to start printing again.
Fb hit and bounced off the low it hit in September. People are insane to think fb should be same value it was in may. It‚Äôs growing 30% year over year.

I sat on their bag for years, I'm not going back unless they get their shit together.  They lag on PR and their stock is fodder for P&D.  Hopefully, the new CEO will get them on the right path.  They're locked in on their Hydrofarm stocks until June and they've been shedding real estate trying to drum up operating capital.  Gonna be a bumpy road.
The difference between 100 shares and a contract at that price was around $200. For 20% more you could‚Äôve owned the underlying asset
As long as you don't get margin called, you will make money. It's just a question of when.
The premiums are pretty nutty. What about selling covered calls to hedge? Obviously that's a risk of getting assigned if it rips higher.
Had to pick up some UVXY $11C for next week because you never know what could happen between now and then. Brutal selloff after tonight‚Äôs speech, some bullshit over the weekend, inauguration problems, whatever.

 Individual investors who recently piled into [GameStop](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GME) Corp. [GME **27.10%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GME?mod=chiclets)are taking a victory lap this week after shares of the struggling company surged¬†more than 90%¬†in the last two days, putting the stock on pace for its best weekly performance on record.

For weeks, members of Reddit‚Äôs popular WallStreetBets forum have been touting GameStop, encouraging others to scoop up shares of the videogame retailer and begin making bullish bets. Several posts on the forum had noted that short sellers‚Äô bearish GameStop bets had been at elevated levels.

 On Reddit on Thursday, WallStreetBets users were celebrating GameStop‚Äôs gains. Many posted screenshots of big wins from bullish options bets. Several talked about how they would spend their profits. One user posted that the experience demonstrates that the WallStreetBets forum ‚Äúruns the market.‚Äù
Vale heading to 20 dollar town tomorrow.

Never doubt Vale.
Yeah just got 2k in there
Hope GME doesn‚Äôt bleed all these gains. Come on just one more +20% day so we can all make it.
What is a realistic price target for GME? Are we talking like $50 or we talking like $100?
Bullish on Biden‚Äôs 1.9‚Äù package
Go 50% in ARKG leaps and don't by too many FDs.
We're not even squeezing yet. I think the true GME squeeze begins at $50 when the hedges have no choice but to capitulate or be destroyed. Right now, this is just intro to ass-raping... and Prof. Cohen hasn't even brought out the syllabus yet.
I bought 100 shares yesterday and 3 √ó 1/21/22 15C yesterday and as it started lifting, I picked up another 100 shares this morning and 3 √ó 2/26/21 15C for S&Gs. 

If this lifts off as much as it looks like it will, I'll have hit two major gainers this week (was holding GME for like 6 weeks.....almost sold l
It last week.)
Uhhh up almost 5% today? Holding April calls
2.5mil shares? Won‚Äôt even notice it.

I stopped (short-term) options when after two years, I had an overall big loss in options and a big gain in stocks. Mathematically with options, the odds are stacked against you unless you get lucky or you're selling premium.

I think the 25-28c has better R/R. It's a 50% retracement from the highs and is OTM enough to help avoid IV crush that will come with closer ATM strikes. Gotta be careful when IV is fuckin 300%.
You're right of course. Unfortunatley this is one of those Challenger models..
I guarantee reddit will once they go public
So could take longer for someone to buy them?
Depends, if they sell above Share price or below. But generally someone has to be bullish on them if they are buying Bought Deals or Private Placements.

Thoughts on GOEV
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see BB go to $15 by early next week
Dilution isn't a snap decision thing.  They certainly can dilute their shares, but that's going to take a board meeting and those just don't materialize out of thin air unless there is an emergency.  I also don't think Cohen is going to let them just shit out a bunch of shares as soon as the price spiked.  He wants the shorts to bleed too.  Once all the shorts have been margin called or closed their positions, then I would hope they would do a share offering as that would be a great way to raise capital for their new direction and continued growth.

So why is BB going up? I don‚Äôt want to buy high sell low again
I don‚Äôt have webull (China owned pos) but I remember hearing a YouTube saying 4am PM.
Yes if stock go up after you sell a put, you get the premium. But if the stock continues to go down, the person who buy the put can exercise it which means you will have to give them 100 stocks for each contract you sold them. Covering simply mean you buy the 100 stocks at the strike price. So if you sell a put at strike price $10, and it continues to go down, the person can exercise the put and force you to buy their 100 stocks at $10 even though you could have buy them at a lower market price.
OK BOOMER! THATS THE WAY!

Its pretty cool its backed completely by Ethereum and has very innovative tech behind it. It was also designed by a mathmatician. Its already live and you can purchase through Uniswap. Before anything though DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH... but if anyone does decide to invest I would really appreciate it if you guys use my referral, You get 10% more shares if you stake and so do I. Regardless, I recommend everyone look into it.

I can't believe you actually did it lmao
Shares is the play.
TLRY crossed 19 AH!! Fuck
Oh no
BB is the next one going üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ. Make sure you dont fuck your sister on this one you retards.

Unless you are retarded so badly you have problem understand historical stock price chart you know with BB it's more like bread and water

Worth it to try to buy some ARKG at opening tomorrow or too late?
What a fucking waste of time. Next time buy an index fund. I did. I am up 24%.
I‚Äôll have 5k in the morning to yolo, which is 10% of my account. Bb shares a good play even after today‚Äôs rise?
I hope so, so I can yolo every payment

Most of my ‚Äústupid‚Äù options plays are comparatively conservative. I pretty much never by single options, but do play a lot of vertical and diagonal spreads, including LEAPS and PMCCs.
It might be? It already is ITM AH.
Bbby short squeeze please
Nope, still has loads of room.
It‚Äôs crazy the amount of people that invest nowadays. Which is good. All power to everyone that‚Äôs trying to become financially free. But they‚Äôre literally teaching classes at my job about options... I work for the DOD.... lmao... this is crazy. I should just tell these ‚Äòtards to hop on this thread. WSB gives the best options classes ü§°. Just hit ‚Äúbuy‚Äù, hold & pray for a 10 bagger lmao.üíéü§≤üèª

I'm going to be in an airplane at market open tomorrow. We shall see if i can find some pockets of service along the route. Good luck to you though!
You're wrong. Don't use that total return website, I've seen how it compares to the actual results you get when you do your DD and actually plot it all out in Excel. It doesn't just miss spinoffs, it somehow gets the dividend reinvestment math wrong. 

Jan 14, 2001 was a Sunday and the 15th was MLK Day. So we'd use the price as of Jan 16, 2001. The closing price was $40.91. The closing price today was $50.31, and remember it's just starting to climb out from a once in a lifetime oil crash. It paid a lot of dividends over those years. It's a great company to own.
This is the top because Supreme kids are buying GME instead of hypebeast shit.

It's just getting started. Still a long way to go brother üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄü™êü™ê

This is awesome. Congrats.
Already 15% up after market, wonder what tomorrow brings.
GME ran up 100%+, which means BB still has at least 40% to go üöÄüöÄüöÄ
i joke bought 2 shares of BB at the top because I hate money
Who remembers that GME dip after that shitty earnings call...oh the nostalgia...and I almost sold.
yeah they'll hedge the 200 shares, but youll get margin liquidated (at a profit, but a lesser profit) on larger positions pretty quick if its melting down.
Hey thanks for the answers. I mean a prop firm that fund accounts to profitable traders. Look up FTMO
True WSB is more powerful tbh. Fk the SEC
Don't really have one.  Ideally positive LOL.

I gotta bag full of Palantir shares  

&#x200B;

I probably shouldn't brag, but dag, my tendies don't even care  

&#x200B;

The problem is I got a lot of brains but no hair  

&#x200B;

I'm starting to pull em out, with every doubt  

&#x200B;

It's unfair

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I'm a diamond in my hands, soon you'll see the plan

Passin' tendy land, my power of grip, you will understand

Only just a mediocre robinhood trader

Soon I'll walk these streets famished

Just know that P-L-T-R  I-S  C-O-M-I-N-G for thee

I could be a dick and tell you the opportunity you missed, but I won't. this sub has already pointed it out. My advice: invest in something that gives you a dividend or an etf. seriously google good safe etf, or etf for a specific sector you like and buy it. Don't touch it for a while and I guarantee it'll  do great
1. I'm planning on buying sth affordable in Italy, Germany is too cold and expensive, that would cost me a 100k

How are you feeling ahead of tomorrow?
Gme has been doing very well pre market almost everyday. Maybe my memory is incorrect but I can't recall a rally so bullish after hours in recent memory. I think its very possible that our run up has not ended and that if pre market tomorrow, if we boost up even more that Friday will be a really strong day going into the long weekend.

See this is kind of where I‚Äôm at. I like your answer haha

I think $24-$25 is pretty fair. It would be amazing to see it climb back to ATH of $186.93, but I think that would have to invoke divine intervention to even get a chance at going that high.
I have 54 behind you
Cause WSB sent it to the MOON!!!!
Fixed #3. Also added a new method for resetting prices. Instead of the price being reset as soon as you move the option, it will stay and can only be reset if you click the option and click the new reset button, or click the overall reset button at the top (which also pulls the latest prices)
Baby ‚Äúpotential‚Äù gains in the daily thread please.
What platform you using to buy shares/ options?
Everyone hates CenturyLink as a product though. They own the rights to the Seahawks and Sounders stadium (Lumen Field) which is a good sign at least, lot of advertising and brand awareness. 

The dividend return is pretty enticing, will wait and see, seems to fluctuate a bit and could drop again to 8-9 range again for a nice price point
There's no flex here. It's education about the term "net worth."
ARKG flying AH

Yeah 40 year olds are the bridge one foot in old world and one foot in zoomer world.
I sold $25 1/15 Calls against my 10,000 shares of GME and I'm sad... I scored them at 16 bucks.

Oh well, the premium was sweet and the capital gains earned is nice.  

But GOD DAMN 16 to 40+ would have been a little better
as of now, the model 3 is the better car. more fun to drive than the S, but that can change when the refresh happens for the S. i wish Elon would make it official so TSLA can moon already.

Anyone know Fidelity‚Äôs cutoff for selling a mutual fund? I ask cause I sold a mutual fund at like 3:15 and am wondering if I‚Äôll have that money to invest tomorrow.
GME 69 tomorrow üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Just did it, 500 more into GME FUCK IT
That‚Äôs the rub that I have been grappling with lately.

When is somebody TOO close to the industry to be trusted, vs when is someone too distant from the industry to effectively fill the role?
its not moving much AH tho
0.0%
I think worst case, I'm down 35k tomorrow. Best case I'm up 300k. It will be interesting.
Ok I read $BB enough times, imma buy üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
it's going to hit $100, don't sell like puss when hits 50 and retraces to 42 ok? deal?
It may actually show up on the chart with AH low volume, probably would get lose in the chart during trading hours eh
because WSB has assumed direct control
if GME hits $1,000 by end of next week i will buy a monkey and train it to ride a dog
He sold them. 2.6 million cash out.
The 1/15 gains you mean?
icln pleas fly again
What do you mean? WSB owned like 10% of shares at one point. is that not a high enough amount to change the market movement of a stock?
Congratulations and go fuck yourself(term of endearment around here).. maybe.

What are your yearly expenses? If you're spending $100k annually, then retiring on what you've got saved up may be difficult. If you spend $35k, then ya you will probably be fine. Make sure to factor in things like health care that work has probably been subsidizing considerably for you. The super-general rule is to have saved 25x your expenses and not withdraw more than 4% annually.

As u/bananahut8 pointed out, make sure you're retiring TO something and I think you will be set. A lot of people fall into that trap and it's something that worries me when the time comes. I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up.

Small town midwest vibe is the best, isn't it? Not sure what you hunt, but hope you got a freezer full of venison this year!
Hey guys, what are your civil war stock picks?
This. I'm not worried about a crash, but a correction is imminent. When? Who knows, so long as vaccines are rolling out, stimmy cash keeps people afloat, and interest rates stay low I don't see any real reason for people to pull money from the market entirely. Moving cash from high flyers to recovery plays? Yes.
I have a sell at $100 to take out my initial investment, then some at $250, then some at $495.  Letting the other half ride.

It's looking nice all year long. Just keep taking gains and rolling it out.
It won‚Äôt be in the Bill anyway

Exactly, they are just much more cost effective than their competitors. Hence why they‚Äôre getting government contracts. This company has so much growth potential. I‚Äôm interested to see how they grow and what their stock price will be end of 2021. I‚Äôm holding for the long term and will keep building my position. 26 January is a key date and the lockup period, primed and ready to moon my friend.
Reddit about to ban the SEC from this platform. We're safe boys.

>and gain 2

no you have a 3000 tax deductible in 2020.  So you will owe taxes on 3000 dollars for year 2. 

year 1: lose 20 k end of year i have a 3k tax deductible.  now my loss is 17 k 

year 2: make 20 k and i dont pay taxes on the first 17k. on the last 3 k i pay tax because that loss was deducted in the previous year
Bro i‚Äôm never fucking leaving again
i dunno but just remember, nobody got hurt selling early to take a prrofit.
Inflation make stock go up. Inflation good
Anyone know what GME weeklies would have made you this week

This is truly a great piece of work. Much better than what many brokers offer. Thank you.
Yep only thing that makes me hold is the partnerships.

I can invest $500 right now. BB or GME, and should it be shares or calls. Lot of new information for me today.

The 1/15 one should be sold though, right?
Bought ARKG at 100, rode it down to 93 and then back up to 100 and got off the ride.  Little salty that it couldn't wait for me to get out of GME before it started going ham again.

Disclaimer: I have a small position in Gevo.

I bought in once I read their earnings call and saw that they paid off their long term debt, signed a new deal with Koch and are opening their Net Zero carbon plant soon. Unlike Fuel Cell, which even its CEO projects won‚Äôt be profitable for years, GEVO is finally in profit after years of struggling.

I see them as a great buy in the $6-8 range.
lol the AH volume made up half the volume today... hahahah
I‚Äôd regret it more if it sells off tomorrow than if it shoots up another 20%+
So this plan is just the foreplay to the climate change infrastructure one coming in a couple weeks. More time to load up

If anything it‚Äôs probably better for retail. It‚Äôs a lot harder for Mom and Pop shops to foot that $15/hr minimum wage, which may mean the end of a lot of small businesses given that on top of the covid losses they‚Äôve had over the last year
Large projected market share of software in automobiles in QNX. Potential massive EV share of that market.

Evolving from the old smartphone company we first knew of.
Oil stocks have been hot the last 2 months and I expect that to continue. They‚Äôre still undervalued and as you said inflation will only increase their price. Right now I think refining stocks are a good play but I would wait until after Q4 earnings. Currently they‚Äôre going to be bleeding quite a bit of money as demand for refined products is still low but oil prices have increased. Once demand increases post lockdown I think those stocks will see a significant gain. Personally I think VLO and MPC are both good investments going forward. Even with the big run the last two months FANG is my favorite in terms of oil exploration companies.
Gains unites us all. If Biden wants to unite the country, pump the market. No one cares if you are left or right when you both ride the GME rocket to space.

How many did you buy? Looks like 3c 2023 only have a volume of 3, I don't know if anyone would sell to fill the orders at the low price
Thanks man will get on that on payday
That close was tough for the $40's that is hilarious.
yes! I'm a huge wuss but GME still made me 4k this week.
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ks4s3s/bb_king_the_blast_from_the_past_with_the/) is what started it [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo4ed/looking_for_the_next_rocket_look_no_further_than/)

But basically, electric vehicle software is the center of it all.
To anyone with GME. Set your stops at $100 and uninstall Robinhood. Your order will go through, but you won't be able to look at it and sell with paper hands.
Sounds like a plan. I‚Äôll try to sell at opening before the selloff happens
Get a lawyer, seriously. The SEC will be contacting you and you may as well get ahead of it. not suggesting you did anything wrong, but just arm yourself.

Good job son...I shouldn't have gone out to buy milk...
Buy it today. Worst case you lose $300 and you have a hundred years to make that up. Grandma will give you that for your birthday. Or you'll make it back in a week with a part time job.   
Best case you make $1-$3k.
You're right to point out PFE's large market cap being part of the equation. COVID contract w/ Operation Warp Speed is $1.95 billion. Compare that to last quarter, when they generated more than $12 billion in revenue, or annualized to nearly $50 billion. 

Granted, that's only the first contract I found, and I only researched it for the sake of this post, so that's only a few seconds of DD, but it still paints a clear picture why its stock price moved so little in comparison to MRNA, whose quarterly revenue is ~$150 million, with an M.
Why now if it's going to $60 soon? No cash raise while short interest is above 50%

I feel like I missed the train with GME but bought some today anyway just to feel included
No! We‚Äôre seriously getting TOO much attention now. And he‚Äôs going to talk about how GME should do an offering, I swear. This man hates us.

It can't be undersold.

They also don't want big box to have leverage power of distribution over them.
yeah except gamestop's market cap is only 2 billion, and 200 million dollars worth of shares not being sold definitely has an effect. its not this bullshit narrative that wsb is responsible for all of gme's movement that people on here parrot, but its definitely not nothing either. 

also, jeff bezos could literally buy gamestop 70 times over and still have plenty of billions left

Agree ICLN can't go tits up under Buyden. I actually got and rolled them to Jan 2022 so I don't have to worry about them for a long time. ICLN is an ETF.
Having trouble with women?  Pay for things with your Robinhood card and casually tell them that you're long GME.  Real long.   You'll have a full black book in no time.

Ahh wouldn't have sold the GME just yet. I think there is a little bit more to gain there. Anyways, I believe more in BB as a company right now so it's a good move and they flew about the same height today. Good on you!

Those after hours $BB numbers we soaring tomorrow
ya it really is
Yoloing my entire paycheck into BB tomorrow
There was a short window of amazing opportunity for about 20-30 minutes between 10:00-10:30am when the stock dropped/flattened and IV dropped. 50c 1/15 were in the 0.50 range at that point. I got in at open unfortunately but if it keeps going it will still pay off pretty big.

At this point you're probably better off just buying shares if you want to hop on the rocket since the premiums are outrageous and will stay outrageous until the squeeze is done probably.
Lyrics are in the comments below. Scrolling lyrics would have taken me even longer and we all know how short attention spans run around here
Keep putting in the work. You are gaining experience with your trades. Limit your risk and learn from your mistakes.   


As of today, SPY is +15.69% for the trailing year. If you're +10% and you're just learning, you're doing alright.
Autistic market levels never before seen.
I'd be a little more skeptical of a younger company, but we inherited this pension system from a MUCH older company (1800s: think Merck, Abbott, Pfizer). That said, I'm aware things can go south (GE comes to mind...).

I'm leaning toward including it and considering it a bond as was suggested above, but keeping in mind its not risk free.
I concur. I was in a lot on Intel leaps because of January effect, but even with new leadership I have little confidence in their ability to gain market share going forward. I don‚Äôt even consider it a distressed asset at 45, let alone what it‚Äôs at now. May go up, but AMD has a lot of pent up momentum to go into.
Get fucked
My God bro I'm asking myself the same question.  I don't know.  My gut tells me not really but at $10 the market might eat this motherfucker up.  And for that reason alone I'd take the risk.
Would it be a WSB if it hadn‚Äôt?
but what if GME goes to $420.69?!
30 GME
Well, Dow Jones quoted someone here saying ‚Äúwe running the market‚Äù lol.
Still worth jumping on this at market open tomorrow or too late once again?
I'm trying out selling puts - thats why it shows as a negative I think. My thought is free premiums on top of calls as long as the stock closes above $36 tomorrow - no idea who is buying these puts I'm selling.
I feel for you brother.

Ya but in-between 2001 and now it hit $100+ multiple times.  So you did lose most of your gains if you kept holding.  Youd be up 150% if you sold at 100$ but instead you‚Äôre only up 25%.  The dividends sure will boost your gain but not by 125%.

I looked at what Cathie did when she was young and she did Finance and Economics, seems pretty intuitive but I was looking for opinions.

I found Business Admin: Investments to be interesting. What should I take to get a CFA also?
All I know about options is, buy calls of you think it goes up, and puts if you think it goes down. So far it‚Äôs worked out
sounds perfect to me. Another dip opportunity!
Famous last words üòÇ
In college I had a job in the computer science's IT department that amounted to being "on call" for any IT issues professors had in their classrooms. I actually got a small office in the top story of the computer science building. I could count on my fingers the number of times I actually had to do anything.

Paid minimum wage, but I was paid to basically have a quiet office I could use to study, do homework, etc. Had that job for two years. Second best gig ever in my working career.

This is really great news for stocks!  Buy buy buy!

you're right. I remember that shit. LL was like a 300 mill market cap which is actually pretty easy to manipulate if you can convince wsb to get in on it. It was like as soon as that post hit wsb the stock ran like 15-20%. its the reason that the sub bans tickers that are under a bill

I used to own a Blaack Berry Bold 9700 or whatever rit was back in a day. Had to make 2 911 emerhency phonecalls in life or death situations then. Both times someone died. In one of those situations the victim could have been saved if they could have gotten there seconds sooner. But.. Both times the emergency call dropped. Fucking dropped! Just like their üöÄ. Through the investigations they found that the call dropping was 100% the devices fault. I found out then that they were notorious for dropped calls and very quickly bought a differant brand phone.

So I believe my broker (Fidelity) will exercise contracts at 4:15 PM EST if they are ITM (https://www.fidelity.com/options-trading/options-auto-exercise-rules)

I plan on using cash to fund the transaction, rather than margin, so technically it should follow cash account rules, rather than margin account rules. I have not actually tried this with Fidelity, but with E-Trade, my 0-day contracts which are ITM get auto-liquidated at 3:50PM if I do not have the cash to support exercise.

In this case I'd be perfectly fine with liquidating at 3:50PM (heck I'd probably exit the majority of the position before that anyway).

There‚Äôs never a ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúperfect‚Äù time to have kids. I see this asked occasionally but the reality is that the older you get (especially as you eclipse the 30 mark), the harder it gets to conceive. 

Sure you may shave a few years off your early retirement plans but is that worth the stress of potentially running into physical problems? As an example and not to get too explicit, some women only have one or two days a month to actually be able to conceive and you have to time your business then. 

Main point here is just have them when you‚Äôre emotionally set to. Another thing to think about too is the longer you wait, the shorter time in life you‚Äôll be able to spend with them and you don‚Äôt want to be like approaching 60 when they‚Äôre barely starting college.

GME is absolutely terrifying right now.  Money is getting made hand over fist, and I'm in it up to my tits, but god damn does it feel like it might end any minute.  BB might be the better play since it just started its pump.

What about the countless local landlords paying a mortgage with rent? The moratorium I can see ending and it will still be on the landlord to evict. At that point they still have to make the financial investment of eviction but also haven‚Äôt been receiving payment the last year with a mortgage payment still coming up. And I‚Äôm sure there will be punishment for defaulting on a mortgage for which you received relief.

Partly true. If we do start selling off, puts will get very expensive. It's better to stay out if you're late to the party, because if the dip gets bought, you're puts will basically get IV crushed in an instant.

There's nothing to congratulate him for. We're not in a kindergarten where you can draw any doodle and get a smiley face sticker. He underperformed the market by double digit %%.

And it's not even about stock picks, it's about his mindset. He's saying that he is focused on the latest 30% gain in 3 months like he got it all figured out and it's gonna be 10% per month from now on. Which means that he did not learn the most important lesson.

It's a compounding machine. When the price sinks, you sink your dividends into it. When the price is high, you buy other stocks. I know it isn't for everyone but this is the kind of stock that can anchor your portfolio, churning out quarterly dividends that you can invest in whatever other sector you like. XOM could have been had for a 10% dividend yield earlier this year.

When selling a CC or CSP, is there any benefit to analyzing the breakeven price?

I was under the impression that the seller will not be assigned until the breakeven price is hit.

Is the strike price the only thing worth considering? What happens if for example I'm selling a put at strike $18 with b/e $20 due to $2.00 premium and the stock is at $19 at expiry? 

It hasn't happened to me yet, but I want to be ready for when it inevitably does. TIA

Balls deep in 2023 calls. I'm determined to have LUMN make me a millionaire. That being said, I don't think it will go above 20 this year unless they can sell the old Centurylink and continue with the Level 3 business model with a better balance sheet. 

Their 450k miles of fibre is a rock solid asset, so I think this is a very safe play for the moment (at the current valuation). But it's a longer term play, this won't rocket to the moon right away.

https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1785/6012472

Just because China identified it first doesn‚Äôt mean that the virus started in China. And don‚Äôt forget that the US media was gloating that democratic nations are better than authoritarian nations in controlling pandemics!
There‚Äôs a difference between catching the knife, I think, and buying an asset you believe in, with cash you‚Äôre sensibly managing, every time the asset drops another ten percent. I‚Äôm not a big investor but I snapped up my first $1500 of crypto this way during the dip.
Yup and now it's been running. Gonna be fun tomorrow. Seems like retail shorts have been climbing in and it's just going to keep cascading the squeeze
> Romance novel lady wearing a sweatshirt w/ a cat on it. Checks out like, 30 romance novels every 3 days.

I was once in the local library while my elementary aged kids were puttering around in the children's section. I was blindly milling around and found myself a few stacks over and there were romance novels, a whole bookshelf, top to bottom, of them. I picked one out and flipped through it. I swear, they were pornography without pictures. They weren't vulgar, per se, but they were very graphic and detailed in the description of what was happening.

It‚Äôs a reference/joke....
Yeah the IV is truly unlike anything I've ever seen. I'm all in on shares, not looking to buy calls at this point. Was just curious because if GME ends tomorrow positive, it seems like it could create another wave of buying going into next week.

My philosophy on trading is buy stocks you believe in. Bought my first stock at 16 with the money I made from cleaning shit. Done Ok, been retiring for the last 12 years.
Nah, they‚Äôre embarrassed that what happened with Tesla is happening again with GME. Short squeeze

What kind of a name is Melvin anyway
New to options trading here.  Would this be a good idea?

Buy a call on BB with a strike price of $8.50, a premium of $0.80, and expiration of 1/15 (tomorrow)?  Break even is $9.30 and current stock price is $9.10.  If the stock goes up 10% I double my money.  Do I have that right?
If we get to 569 like that one DD said I'll be making one üòÇ
all becky stocks about to moon
I'm assuming because of the low cap
Lmao I know nothing about BB but bought a few $10 calls at the end of day today on a retard whim. After hours looking pretty sweet.
This is not a pump and dump because no one plans to sell
This is what the beginning of a "fire purchase short ass covering margin call" looks like.

If that‚Äôs true, then nasdaq 40k
Ill be willing to sell Melvin my GME shares, all 16 of em, if he posts a video here of himself fucking an actual pig a la black mirror.
beautiful. it it expires over $40 the squeeze will be even more insane. 90k calls waiting to turn into 9,000,000 million shares.

That's just one strike, if we hit 45 there will be another 100k calls/10 mil shares.

at 55 we tack on another 70k calls.

So if we hit 55, that's 26 million shares that are going to have to be coughed up ~18 million taking into account there's already been delta hedging.

I'm not selling. You're not selling. So where are the shares coming from? Shorts are fucked.

Tomorrow is our lunch time, do not worry
Okay thank you. I promise I'm not trying to be difficult haha, just trying to get a handle on all of this. I appreciate your help here.

So if I'm understanding what I read, selling to close would mean selling my already purchased call for the premium, plus or minus any fluctuation that occurred while I held it, I would take whatever amount that was and close my contract with that person. Whereas, selling to open would suggest that I already have 100 stocks and am writing a contract to sell to a trader?

Final question. Can I exercise my contract at any point or do I have to wait x amount of time?
Seems there is a huge $43 sell wall on GME. Every time it touches 43 it drops.

If you have had GME since <$20 and you sell you are a MORON.  You know, I know, this isn't even close to over yet, hold strong.

It will only ever will live in the mind. There is literally no benefit that a decentralized currency would bring to the world; especially one with a fixed amount of currency, massively slow transactions and incredibly high transaction costs and energy consumption.  It will never replace the world‚Äôs reserve currency because a reserve currency relies on much more than the existence of physical currency. It would also eliminate monetary policy which is a necessary lever to pull or a tool in the toolkit to manage economies.  It would only exist in some revolutionary change to the way we, humans, govern globally.

This seems dodge, S3 & a bunch of other posters have provided strong evidence that short interest has INCREASED (inc Ortex predicting a big rise). How are you getting information that they got out half their positions already, essentially invalidating all of these???

Boomers got accustomed to the lousy 7% ish per year the market returned in the 2000s, so they're running high on that 10% per year.

They would hit the 13% the S&P has been getting, but you have to subtract 1% of principal to their mutual funds and a couple % more for resolutely holding onto garbage from the 1980s/1990s like KO.

This makes no sense. If you have a beta of 2 and the stock is fair valued, then it will move up at twice the ‚Äòspeed‚Äô of the market and move down at twice the ‚Äòspeed‚Äô of the market. How is that high risk low return? It‚Äôs balanced. In this case, beta has nothing to do with it and you are simply saying that is something is undervalued it is a better proposition that something that is fairly valued.

I was scrolling through my old GME calls I bought and sold. When GME was down to 13 in December I bought 5 $18c 1/22 and sold them a week later for the smallest gain. They would‚Äôve been worth over 10k if I didn‚Äôt have paper hands.
I think you should look at the banking sector if you are looking at it from the long term.  It had a run in recent days from the bottom, but they are undervalued.  I think Alphabet is a good long term bet once the advertising dollars start flowing more after COVID.  Could move more compared to its peers.

Eh, I did this correctly right? I bought shares at $35.52. Current share price is $43. I set Stop Loss Sell on Robinhood for $36; so if I wake up tomorrow and the stock plummets to $10 (for example), I would‚Äôve still made a couple pennies because it sold at $36 with this. But if I wake up and it‚Äôs at $50 then I still have all my shares. Correct?

Nah we winners tomorrow buddy üöÄüöÄ
Ah thought you were talking AH
Wish I could tell you, but no timeline here. There's lots of DD on VALE that shed light on all the different metals. Steel is in shortage right now... that's VALE. Iron is heavily needed by China... that's VALE. Nickel is needed so hard as we're at the dawning on the age of the electric vehicle... that's VALE. Everything about this just screams get on it and hold until it doesn't.
I‚Äôm saying 100k is a lot going off of a 10/10 or 7/7 and I don‚Äôt believe 100k is 7%  for you. 
It‚Äôs a massive degenerate gamble call it what you want, saying it‚Äôs not is a lie and you know it.
Bee bee eye too
$SENS is looking like a good buy.

Hold over the long weekend and sell mid-next week.

Don't miss this one, guys! That volume is climbing.

If you sell ICLN for GME, you were never a believer in the first place and hoped on simply cause of this sub. Not that you won‚Äôt make money on GME of course.

Everything you said is wrong, but other than that, great post.
If you are looking at that now I doubt that will be the price at open since BB is up 13% in after hours trading
Opportunities like this...There will be SO MANY BOOMERS in here for this Friday's release. What car are we taking through boomerland? Something safe to ease them in? Consumer Reports top safety pick?

This man literally saved the US economy and the freaking global economy.
It‚Äôs what your wife‚Äôs boyfriend gets.
Did you sell the top? You should have scalped a quick day trade. It was pretty obvious when it went over 40 that it would come back down. I'm out of day trades till tomorrow so rip me but it was fun to watch
I'm jealous of smart people in WSB those expecting GME short squeeze and take massive gains.

I was not smart enough to understand that really happen, that's why I'm poor I guess.

How was ICLN at $50 in 2008 and never recovered until now?
It's honestly painful too read all these entitled, rude and "bragging" comments. No one cares if you've made $1000 in a month, you're on the internet so you basically don't matter and what you say is not true xD

Instead of being dickheads be constructive, give tips, be happy for OP. Everyone learns at different speeds and ways. Hell I can't be bothered to read books or listen to annoying peoples pods learning the stock market.   
I watch a few, very few YouTube channels and then learn by doing and hanging on this reddit and checking out companies that interest me.
In reference to your past comment tho, they wouldn't have to cover puts because this shit is sky high now. What are you saying they would need to cover in regards to puts if the price is up
Pls BB don't.. Don't that much. I wanna fly with yoou
Insane and news was out last week and lot of chatter over the weekend

Huh, look at that, a week earlier.

Look, DFV has supposedly made 5 million bucks or whatever, which is far more than I ever made, so awesome for him. I wish I'd had the brains a year and a half ago to be tracking Burry, but I'll try to learn now rather than never.
It's okay I bought some on open and they were up 35% a few minutes later then I sold them for -5% a few minutes after that lmao. Just buy stock
What‚Äôs the MOST shorted stock??!!
It sounds like you are both responsible adults, so I'm sure you will figure it out. If having children is important to you, you should plan accordingly but not let financials completely dictate when you start.


Especially if you both plan to have more than 1 child, timing is very important (ie. Don't have them too late in the game). Of course there are lots of pros to starting a family later (more financial, emotional, and psychological stability) but unfortunately biologically it could be an issue. Not everyone gets pregnant right away, although hopefully that won't be an issue for you and your SO.


I have friends that ideally wanted 3 children, but due to poor planning in regards to timing, will ultimately not get to their ideal number of children.


Just a different perspective. Children will definitely set your FIRE date back and likely inflate your FIRE number. However, if children are important to you, it shouldn't hinge entirely on your financials. 


Good luck :)!

A lot of wiping down tables, sweeping up the floor, cleaning the stuff behind the counter, cleaning up customer puke one time.

And that's to say nothing about the other fun stuff like having to come in early to open, or stay late to close. Or having to deal with customers.

You can look at previous comments in this and the posts prior and see what people say. 

It‚Äôs not really up to me about how long it turns over (you can look at previous posts and most of it just kept saying FDX, and BYND, and that just rocketed after free falling.  

There was another company with a L in its name (I know it‚Äôs not helpful but there‚Äôs a lot of tickers I go through so it‚Äôs kind of hard to keep track. Same applies as above.
in order to buy an option u need a seller. why would anyone sell u a $0 option when the only movement possible on it is up?
Hey everyone,

I recently tried individual stock picking, and I am thinking that probably isn't for me. I think instead I want to DCA into VTSAX and then choose just a couple of different ETFs to get more specific exposure. I know the ARK ones are super popular right now, and I heard a lot of people talking about QQQ or ICLN. I am thinking of trying to have money there for 5+ years, hopefully even longer. What would be some of your recommendations?

TIA
Yeah I think there's a good chance this rides into next week before any sort of correction. Think the only question is how high it goes tomorrow before profit taking halts the ride.
Look at the 10 year chart for IWM lol. This is going to end in tears

That‚Äôs 70% of my portfolio. I was thinking I should make a leap to stocks and then made this dumb decision :p
Is Melvin also shorting GME in addition to owning those puts? i.e. they doubled down on their short position with this stock?

This explanation only holds weight if they also shorted the stock.

Alright folks. I threw 30k into GME shares this morning. Put 100% of my wife's IRA into GME shares. Holding 2000 shares all together now. Unfortunately, because of COVID, I don't think I can evict my wife's boyfriend yet.
Just after we got married in our mid-20s, I sat my beautiful wife and I down (she was reluctant) to map out some 10 year projections - life, work, family, wealth and so on. Not so it was set in stone - just so we had some plan to work towards, and adjust if better options came along.

That one sheet of paper got filed, we moved overseas for a couple of years (which had been one of the plan options!), and I found it about 7 years later when we moved back 'home' to start a family. The specific form of how we would grow wealth had changed - we were more property-savvy in our 20s, and also underestimated how fast those values would grow - but the results were incredible.

We were both earning more than we had hoped. And despite largely putting our finances on hold for 2 years while travelling, our Net Worth was almost exactly what we had forecast it to be at that time. (We ended up smashing the 10 year goal out of the park, because we were far cleverer in our 30s.)

That exercise, and then seeing how it paid off IRL, was really important for us. As you say, it gave us the real world proof that our optimistic planning could create tangible results. And that made us more confident to aim higher!

Thanks for sharing.
Clean energy has been down or flat all week tho besides PlUg

Not too late! My word of advice is wait 15 or 20 minutes after market opens to decide if it‚Äôs a good time to enter. 

Also shares are taxed less if you hold for a year! More money in the long run.
You didn't buy to close that position when the squozening began?  I had 25 strike covered calls of my shares too for 1/15.  I closed them shits yesterday morning the minute it broke through 24 and started looking mean and angry upwards.  Took my little 10k beating on that and made 100k on the shares I kept.
There are moments when i'm happy that i'm not an American taxpayer.

I'm thinking of buying 29/1 $11.5C BB tomorrow morning. Counting on big settlement news.
Should I sell TNXP now (after hours) or tomorrow. I‚Äôm up like 4.5% but I don‚Äôt wanna risk dipping tomorrow and losing money. Any suggestions?
How do I buy tickets for the opening performance???
WSB should have it's own ETF hahaha
Looks like Tlry is starting to move too.

Where do you get these infos?
Have you factored in the risk that no dividend is paid, and that the equity tanks 50% in value, so your yield falls off a cliff...? If you are getting paid 9% above risk free rate then you are getting paid because you are taking risk.
People used to hate watching other people play because most other people were shit at the game so it wasn't entertaining. You see these streamers that are ridiculously good at games, and that's entertainment for many.

BB to hit $100
I'm guessing that Vanguard is using the term risk in the sense of classical financial theory, specifically the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).  In this model the risk of an asset is roughly equivalent to the volatility of its price, and you can see from looking at the historical time series of S&P 500 prices that it often experiences very dramatic swings over short periods of time.

The question is: does this definition of risk matter to you as an investor?  The answer is yes.  If your time horizon is short, then it matters because a high volatility stock could lose you lots of money that you need.  Risk, in this case, is bad.

If your time horizon is long, then you care about this notion of risk because you want to take more of it!  According to the CAPM, higher risk assets generate greater returns over the long run - for instance, we predict that bond returns will be lower than stock returns on average _because they are less volatile_.  High long-term returns are the reward you get for tolerating more volatility.

So that means you should put all your money in Bitcoin because that's one of the most volatile assets out there, right?  No, not necessarily: not all volatile assets have positive expected returns.  For a single stock or currency there are too many stupid random things that could happen that would kill your returns - Tesla is great, but what if Elon Musk gets hit by a bus?  The only way to protect yourself from that kind of risk is diversification: own hundreds or thousands of volatile stocks, and then it's nearly impossible that all of them will get unlucky.

So that's how you can reconcile the lingo.  Vanguard says that the S&P 500 is risky because it's volatile, and /r/investing says that the S&P 500 is safe because it's sufficiently diversified that we can reasonably expect to be compensated over the long run for tolerating its volatility.

Hey, just going to throw an idea out there: for slow-moving, steady dividend payers, selling covered calls is a way to generate a little extra money.  

I'm doing that with AT&T right now.  I sell out-of-the-money call contracts that are higher than my average buy-in price.  It's a no risk strategy that can add a few percent in yield.

That's interesting...  I've been trying to figure out what I will do in 10 or so years when I hopefully retire early.  10 years is plenty of time for me to slowly find an interesting open source project to get involved in.  Whether I try to monetize that in retirement or just continue to be involved as a hobby would depend on how much effort I really want to put into it.

I guess it is time to start looking through open source projects to find an interesting one.

By that Logic Half my portfolio is full of better companies than Apple. Arconic is up 270% since i bought them in may. Guess they are the superior company.
I'm positively retarded, so please explain where I've got this wrong:

Melvin Capital borrowed 5 million shares, and sold them, but have the obligation to return those shares at the end of the contract term. Right? That's how they make money, they expect the price to go down, so they can buy back the stocks at a lower price than they sold them for at the start of the contract. Right?
It does make sense. Yes, the stock moves at "twice the speed" of the market as you said. The point is that when it reaches it's fair value you no longer expect it to continue to do so. It's reached the value you placed on it, there's no fundamental reasons to believe it will continue to increase. That's where the high risk low reward comes in. It only takes place when the stock reaches it's fair value, because at that point it shouldn't, in theory, continue to go up with a bull market because it's at its fair value, but in a bear market it will still have it's high beta loss at "twice the speed" of the market. Making it high risk and low reward

I was stupid to buy ICLN instead of GME or BB and now Biden is cucking us by not including clean energy in his plan, great.
Please, for the sake of your PP, don't buy calls now. Shares should be good but the ride will go up AND down so keep your arms and legs safe from any danger. But the IV is brutal for a reason. If you think the squeeze will happen then buy shares. If you have time (months/years) buy shares. Calls can easily reduce your PP by one or two digits.
I hope to be you one day
There's definitely going to be a painful restructuring. I live next to NYC and small businesses have been decimated. It'll come back eventually with new businesses and new owners. But until then the small business sector is going to be in really bad shape.

You should buy shares. 

A call is where you‚Äôre buying the rights to 100 shares and basically you‚Äôre gambling on the possibility it will go up to a certain amount by a certain date. Rocket potential upside and catastrophic potential downside (if it doesn‚Äôt reach what you predicted it would, you lose 100% of it, and it goes down quickly if you guess wrong). Also, once the rocket has initiated liftoff, you e pretty much missed the possibility of making a profit on calls. 

TLDR: buy shares until you‚Äôre ready to go full R.

This is very good I like it. Bank earnings kicking off will set the tone for the market. NFLX earnings will likely be a good read thru for DIS and commentary for ARPU increases and guide for subs/ARPU will drive px movement.
Just dumped 9K into GME shares at close. Averaged up. Don‚Äôt care. 

We‚Äôre either going to Tendy Town tomorrow or the soup line.

I‚Äôd never sleep again
shit man.. comments like this may get us banned ahhaha
My 10-11$ 2/19 calls have already been printing this week and the breakout run just started üöÄ
Such delicious tendies
Youre not wrong, but I made my fair share on gme already and cashed out (600% gain or so)
Why is VIX up
This is the way
Anyone know what to make of POWW (Ammo)? They‚Äôve had a string of promising catalysts the last few days, jumped up to an all time high and have now come back down.  Keep holding on or dump it now and cut losses?
That‚Äôs gonna land way in the money. Did you pick them up cheap?
my call is from december 23rd! i bought a 25c @ 1.85 and saw it drop to .20 last week. After all that red IDGAF if I settle at 22.00 or 16.00.
oh gotcha
Disneyland announced today they are cancelling everyone's annual pass. Could be the bad news that caused a dip

Yea keep dreaming. Retail investor made it through so many bubble pops throughout history.
Why isn't this in the news everywhere yet?
Congrats! This is an exciting step.

If you can, before leaving your company I‚Äôd rollover your IRA into your company 401k to take advantage of the IRS rule of ‚Äú55‚Äù. It allows you to withdraw from your current company‚Äôs 401k, after separating, after you turn 55. The key is it needs to be in that company‚Äôs 401k when you leave. Otherwise you‚Äôll need to wait till 59.5 to withdraw from your IRA without penalty. Unless of course you‚Äôre planning on performing a 72t to pull the money out beforehand.
So generalizations are ok if it's backed up by personal experience. Cool!
GME
Any of my 30+ bros remember the GTA San Andreas release

ARCT been shitting the bed too
GME is the way
Yeah, that one looks familiar
I don‚Äôt stay long in any stock but do keep a a a few if it grows further in the future.
So, the 11.40 is the price got the contract at. So lets say he has 1 contract w strike of 11.40 100 x 11.40 == 1140.

Current price is 40ish. So the 100 is now x 40. 100 x 40 = 3000. Multiplied by the number of contracts he had. Thus, the insanity. Essentially he placed a bet in April that the price would be at least 11.40. Its 40. He bet 70k on that. Now hes a multi millionaire. Balls of steel.
Yah pretty week price action considering the stimulus package he‚Äôs already announced üòï
Damnnn, whats your price target?
Pump money, could be talking about hookers, they need tendies too
IM JUST FEARFUL AFTER NIO AND PLTR, HELP ME. SAVE ME FROM THIS HELL
BB, BBBY, or more GME calls with these 1/15 profits?
Yes. Yes it does. Having a rough day over it if I only I held one more day lmao it‚Äôs ok though someone‚Äôs comment like this helped me earlier. Their is always another play and another chance
wait, so calls on RC?
The shares are what squeezed the short
MELVIN WILL REGRET THIS
shouldve held my gme calls smh, still profited though and switched to shares
it gassed, so it's going to brake and dip according to e-40
GME is Not dipping.  The math just isn‚Äôt there.  This is not a normal rally/hype.  It was a momentum thing.  It‚Äôs now becoming a squeeze within the next week.  


This doubling in under 48hrs has made all shorts unprofitable.  It doesn‚Äôt matter where they entered.  


Short seller‚Äôs peak profit happens if a stock goes to $0.  No one expects GME to be at $0 even in the next few years.  But assuming it could a month from now, let‚Äôs do the maths. 


Most shorts got in around $15 or less.  That means the most they can make is $15, **IF** GME goes to $0 (it won‚Äôt). 


Now any time you borrow anything, you have to pay interest on it, this includes shares.  The current interest rate is 45% (or higher).  The interest is on the price of the current shares, not the price they bought in at.  


This means on a share price of $40, they are paying nearly $0.60 a day to short it.  Doesn‚Äôt sound too expensive right? Until you realize that in less than 25 days, they will have paid more in interest than they could ever gain, even if GME went to $0 in February. 


Keep in mind, once a short seller realizes it is literally impossible to make money, they just need to time their exit.  Since this is a stampede of short sellers, the best time to exit is right away.  They literally can‚Äôt wait 3 weeks, or else they might as well paid $12 more a share (from the interest they‚Äôre going to accrue).  


Keep in mind, this is all voluntary covering.  There are also tons of accounts out there that will now have to cover due to margin calls and such.  


Keep in mind that 71 million shares are shorted.  That‚Äôs more than are technically available.  


Keep in mind that 20% of shares are locked up by Cohen & such, who cannot sell for a few more months.  So that leaves even less shares for the shorts.  


Once most of the shorts cover (within 3 weeks), the price won‚Äôt drop overnight.  They have to buy more shares than available and anyone left holding shorts will still be buying.  And by that time, a new base & support level should have been established.
Never will I doubt his next move(s).
That bitch is printing hard rn, people will wish they got in tomorrow lol

You're thinking of Citron having a high return with 20% of capital. Melvin has 7B (its on wiki), but I think you do raise a good point!
I haven‚Äôt shopped at GameStop in years because of their terrible trade in value for games, but now they‚Äôre making up for it
$1.9t? what sort of bargain bin shit is this biden
Do you have to be approved by Robinhood in order to be able to trade options? The broker I use just denied me...
GME sells Fun Co pops whose ticker‚Äôs market cap is too small to mention but my 2/19 $7.50c on this little figurine maker have been running hot.

so, I'm sitting here all happy about the fitbit deal because I bought cheap calls a few months ago, but then I realized.. "wait, I don't have that kind of luck".. those shit are going to just evaporate, right?  now does that shit work?
Every stock with high short interest is squeezing. I‚Äôm pissed they‚Äôre all going up and I can‚Äôt jump in all of them.
yeeee bebe. slow and steady but still bleeds my calls dry! just enough for the tease
Don't matter. It's coming and today ICLN was red so tomorrow it'll rebound. 2 red days would make no sense at this time.

Why are people so hard, is everyone here a typical hedge fund manager who thinks only they can trade stock!? Seriously the bois at wallstreetbets are 100x nicer than ppl in this thread. This thread surprised and disappointed me.
Yeah, I like to think I would chuck most of it into a Vanguard boomer fund as a set and forget - but I‚Äôm not sure I could help myself
This is probably the first time **in history** that retail traders are bending over hedge funds. 

All you have to do to make tendies is buy GME shares, and hold until after Melvin's puts expire. 

It's that easy. Get paid.

Been holding 1000 shares of APHA since early December which is pretty much the same thing at this point.
‚ÄúBut this week he saw CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer talking about GameStop. He decided to purchase roughly 80 shares of the company for slightly more than $20 apiece at the opening bell Wednesday‚Äù
They have the same stock symbol as I do. I bought them last week too.
I‚Äôm dealing with this now and it is incredibly annoying. My last paycheck of the year saw a ‚Äúbump‚Äù of $7500 from the cost of movers and all that, and then the estimated additional taxes withheld of 1300 or so. Between this, working in two states for exactly 50% of the year each, some cap gains, and bank account churning I might genuinely hire a tax person this year instead of using software.
Yes
You guys. At some point we have to think about another sub Reddit to throw under the bus if the SEC comes for our GME pump.

Those calls, which he‚Äôs been holding for fucking ever, were out of the money at the beginning of the week and he was still holding them. He still has a thousand 4/16 calls.

I‚Äôm kind of offended on his behalf that you are doubting any decision he makes at this point. This man is CLEARY infallible.

Been in for about 2 weeks and I can see OPTI hitting $1 100%. The 2B contract gives the company 100M in profit. At a modest PE ratio of 15, OPTI should be trading at nearly a dollar. And of course most companies these days trade far above that ratio. Just being modest and conservative. This is without taking into account other factors such as buy back and other revenue they make. 

$2 could be possible if they allocate their 100M properly. I would be too happy if this hit $2-3. Currently have about $5000/17% of my portfolio in it. OPTI to the moon
Why you leaving $1,135.49 in the trash can?
Bought it at the dip, but fomo is one hell of a drug.
Just lie on all the questions but yes you have to be approved
How does inflation play into that?
>So if I'm understanding what I read, selling to close would mean selling my already purchased call for the premium, plus or minus any fluctuation that occurred while I held it, I would take whatever amount that was and close my contract with that person.

Yes, you‚Äôre now done with the contract and it‚Äôs been sold off to someone else who may exercise.

>Whereas, selling to open would suggest that I already have 100 stocks and am writing a contract to sell to a trader?
You can sell a call or sell or a put. Selling a call means someone has the right to force you to sell to them at the strike price. Selling a put means someone has the right to force you to purchase the shares from them at the strike price. 

>Final question. Can I exercise my contract at any point or do I have to wait x amount of time?

We never ever will. Too retarded.
Sounds like you don't have the proper psychology and mental appetite for trading. Either buy for long term hold or dont buy a stock at all if you are worried about short term moves.

So does the second part of what I say come into play then?   Did selling and missing out on big upside taint your view of the company or people who are still invested?   I mean I have been there.   There is nothing wrong with locking in gains and hindsight is always 20/20 but it is hard to not be irritated when you make a play and then the stock runs up another 500%.    So are you sure that what you believe about the company. and what is occurring now. is rational and not just you being pissed that you missed the ride?
Gonna bleed out like it always does
That WSJ article from 20 minutes ago is awesome hahahaha wow ...GME
Something about a pump & dump
Not necessarily, energy in general could just go up. We're gonna need a ton of energy if Biden announces big infrastructure plans tonight

Might be a bit of a stretch to say the market has never been an indicator of the economy? Back when the main companies were the main employers, there was probably a better correlation. In a world of global and often remote labor, with the differences tech brings, and a market upheld with massive amounts of liquidity from the Fed, the world is a bit different now.

>Because back then a recall would have tanked their company. They put profits in front of people, plain and simple

Tesla did not consider the issues life threatening and a recall probably would have killed the whole company if they did. but Tesla did not start showing a profit till Q2 of 2019 so i dont know what you mean by "they put profits in front of people" when they have been struggling for most of their history to grow and satisfy investors.

but you are giving other companies to much credit. other companies like ford wait years before the issue recalls on thing like electronic rearview mirrors and engine fire risk until to many people complain.

i fail to see how not recalling failing MC1's is as "reckless and dangerous" as some of the recalls other companies have had but companies like GM are experienced when they have to recall 840,000 cars over seatbelt issues.
sure

I'm still trying to figure out that myself. I've made money on VALE and ICLN and APHA leaps and lost money on BABA and CRM leaps. When I spend $2k on a leap it goes down. When I spend $150 to $500 it goes up.
Is this a SPAC? If so, go check out the SPACs sub for info on how to trade these.

Yeah mb not aware of the proper terms. I think I get it. You're saying they're actually minimizing the squeeze by trading premiums on the calls for price increases to minimize their short position before it explodes. Aren't they still fucked tho on the price difference since they've been shorting since it was like $10 or something? But yeah I see how that's definitely better than a full on squeeze where they'd be out a few bil as opposed to maybe less than one bil now. I guess the move now is to monitor call volumes and see if they're actually doing that? Would one way to counter that is if we retards or the market moves to then buying calls as well?

yes, get in here. If we get the 55$ call in the money 24h after release, there's almost no way it doesn't trigger the squeeze to be squozen.
The problem with T is, that it either declines or goes sideways, it literally doesn't go up like most other stocks do, even if the market is bullish and the dividend is part of the reason for it because it's so high that it obstructs the way to debt reduction.

If OP is right and this hits $100-$300 by 1/22, I make like $4k-$20k depending on when I sell if this calculator is right, correct? Or does this profit calculator change each day depending on movement? 

Seems weird to me that it would shift after you already bought, this is simply a scale of what the price is at what date.

Answering this question is exactly why I use the weekends to create rules for myself for the coming week. 

I always reset my big-picture assessment of my portfolio based on my activity for the week and any price changes, and decide if it's where I want it. 

If a holding has grown too large and needs to be trimmed (Bio Nano), or if my outlook has changed and no longer warrants having as much allocation as I have given it (BABA), or if I've decided that further downward movement means it's time to cut losses, I mark it as one of the holdings that needs to be trimmed. If I find a stock on sale, I only allow myself to fund it through sales I've marked ahead of time, outside of the madness of the trading day. 

This is how I keep my portfolio in line with my risk tolerance. It's also how I avoid panic selling if I happen to notice a stock is down 6 or 7 percent in a day.
Should I go bb tomorrow?

Looking for help picking ETFs to diversify holdings in global online retail.

I researched a few ETFs:

ONLN - top 5 holdings - Amazon, Wayfair, chewy, etsy, ebay. Expense Ratio - 0.58%. Best at dividends as well.

https://etfdb.com/etf/ONLN/#holdings

FDNI - top 5 holdings - Meituan, Tencent, Shopify, Alibaba, Naspers. Expense Ratio - 0.65%

https://etfdb.com/etf/FDNI/#holdings

EBIZ - top 5 holdings - Etsy, Pinduodo, MercadoLibre, expedia, JD.com. Expense Ratio - 0.50%

IBUY - top 5 holdings - Revolve, Qurate, SFIX REAL TRIP - This one seems to do its own thing. Expense Ratio - 0.65%

BUYZ - top 5 holdings - Sea Ltd Singapore, Fiverr, Shopify, MercadoLibre, Amazon, Square. Expense ratio - 0.50%

I was thinking of 50% ONLN and 50% FDNI. Appreciate any counterpoints and advice.

Perfect. I‚Äôm loading up.
I have admittedly been wrong about Gamestop up to this point.  (The stock, not the company)  There was a 100% intraday move on Wednesday.  Most places have a 2 day window to cover a margin call, which explains the froth moves to the upside today and into tomorrow.  Heading in to a 3 day weekend, it just seems like a perfect storm set up to the downside.
What's the game plan. They have 6 days to cover, do we hold until Tuesday? I would be fine with 75$?
My stimmy check is going straight into more BB

I imagine landlords without the liquid funds to cover the mortgages on their rental properties could just take advantage of the mortgage forbearance and tack it onto the end of their loan like any other home owner. The property turnover costs you‚Äôre talking about is just a risk you take when you are a landlord. There is no guaranteed 100% occupancy on your properties. But I don‚Äôt think there will be enough broke landlords suddenly defaulting on their loans to trigger a market crash.

I knew the dems would end up winning the senate because of the unrest in the country as well as Biden winning the state, so there was a real possibility. I went with tilray because weed stocks got huge boosts from just mentioning wanting to decriminalize weed and even Biden winning the presidency, and tilray felt like the best cannabis stock to go with. I also wanted my money back really fucking bad so I said fuck it losing 10k more was worth risking it to get my money back and more

It‚Äôs an interesting but tricky situation though. Redistributing wealth typically increases M1 money supply which leads to inflation. 

For the us 99%ers who gives a shit if food costs 2% more, but for the government that‚Äôs 30 trillion in debt inflation and interest can lead to a death spiral. Not a great easy solution for easing things back to normal, this obviously isn‚Äôt sustainable but the decades of growth at all costs is gonna be tough to unwind

These are my two:

From what I've gathered (not very experienced but I've been holding GME since 18ish) big mutual funds that were shorting have to cover their shares which means all those empty short shares are going to be added into the market. And it's just a vicious circle from there for them, but for us üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

I had Fitbit call options that expire on 5/21, but now I can't do anything with them because of the Google acquisition.  What happens now?

Fit $8c 5/21 was worth $0.06 when the acquisition went through.  Google bought Fitbit for 2.1B, Fitbit had 244,870,000 shares, so the price that Google bought Fitbit for was $8.58 per share?  Does that do anything for me?

My hands are starting to look like paper
Flawless victory
Back in December I read some random comments about BB transforming themselves over the years to be more software oriented rather than hardware by trying to specialize in cybersecurity (huge growth industry this decade). Bought Jan 2023 calls right then and there. Now there's news of them getting partnerships with AWS and EV industry? That shit is dynamite baby.
I did but I wish I did more only 5bills worth
It's only been one day. Get on or get out of the way. We going up with or without.
do you have to buy all 100?

Amazing bro lol
It hurt pretty bad. But I bought more of my long term holds. Luckily didn't get hit by any bad option positions. I try to close out consistently at 25%, 50% and then 100%; might let one or two contracts ride.
I can't believe this comment got gold..
I need answers to all these questions

Thanks, I'd like to think so too. I only need it to get to 270.
It‚Äôs the ratio of shares sold short intraday

If that is the algo then it's the opposite of what you said, but that post is pretty old
I'm a total noob, but I added 1 GME share to my account. Also broke at the moment.
imagine shorting something cause it keeps going up.
imagine.
The lost decade was a long time ago, I'm talking about the last decade.

If the price target is $4-5 short term and if its currently significantly lower then you have your answer. It doesn't matter if its 1.7 or 2.05, the target is much higher therefore the only question that should remain is, why haven't you bought it yet?

GME will keep it like this for the next week as well. Can you? üí™üí™
I guess if your premise is this is some sort of pump and dump play, this makes sense. I don't think you're going to see swings down to the 20's though, today hit the 34 floor and repeatedly bounced. I think fair non manipulated value of the company is 90, and most companies trade at higher than their value so I'm in it for 90-300 long term.

I'd exercise and hold the shares, if you can afford it. BB is solid long term cybersecurity
China still hid it. They definitely deserve criticism. Even my friends in China agree on that. I don‚Äôt remember the media ever gloating about that. If they did, shows how stupid they are as we completely failed.

Pretty different. Stripe is mainly a payments processor that allows e-commerce sites to accept payments, versus Plaid currently is just a way to link your bank account to apps like Robinhood, Venmo, etc.

Of course, things could change, and Plaid may try to enter payments processing, but right now it doesn't.

Taken from the article:

> ‚Üí Plaid is NOT a payment processor

> While their marketing might not make this super clear, Plaid actually doesn‚Äôt process or facilitate payments (outside of the UK, at least). They take care of connecting to your bank accounts, as well as basic read-only data (account balances, etc.), but they don‚Äôt actually move money around themselves - they typically rely on a third party provider like Stripe or Wells Fargo to do that.

Nah. You made bank off pump and dumps. And now trying to take credit for the GME play that's been being preached on here by a million others as well. Last I seen, you were pumping some shit stonk. Tanked literally the next day after it went up 11 or 12%. Days later I seen you bragging about how rich you were. You stole money from a bunch of wsb retards such as myself. Good for you bro.

Anyways, I don't care if you're a genius at picking meme stocks. You are cringy as fuck. What kind of sociopath makes memes about himself and upvotes anything he does with his 100 accounts. Hurry the fuck up and downvote me more lol. Not all of us care about internet fame
This is the way
I think they are hoping we get scared it will dip and sell during the day, creating the dip. Then they cover slowly until it hits that same barrier. Then they cover more AH and pre-market and hope people take profits early, so they can buy the dip. I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense, but what I mean is HOLD

Do you live with your mom? Does she cook your food and do your laundry? You might be 18 but if she is still doing these things for you then whether you have a job or not unless you are paying rent and paying your fair share of bills you are not adulting and therefore not a lot you can do about it. If you‚Äôre afraid of her backlash than she still has some sort of upper hand over you in the form of one of things i mentioned in the first few sentences. If you want to be a big boy then you need to do big boy things.

>under heavy scrutiny, its not going to happen again

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're really young.

Tough pill to swallow: their brand is toast. Enron went to shit for more. VW only recovered because a relatively small portion of their brand was tarnished in a section of their market.

A small brand like Luckin is completely fucked. They will never recover, and don't have the market share to even try.

Sell while you can dude.

As long as there‚Äôs also not a bunch of unemployed gaps thrown in and it‚Äôs plainly obvious you‚Äôre leveling up rather than moving every time management gives you constructive criticism, I imagine it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Only thing I could maybe see is the new company questioning the cost/benefits of training a new guy with a habit of finding greener pastures every few years. Or maybe they‚Äôll go for it because they won‚Äôt need to train you up as much.

As someone below said. They make money on spreads (tiny bits but adds up for them,you shouldn't notice unless you buy stocks with big spreads). But largely also make money with their CFD service I think. Similarly on spreads, but then with leverage so higher amounts.
Lol we're good. As far as ik, all the DD posted here has been publicly available information
Why did BB go up?
Looks like it‚Äôs just you and me!
Yeah super easy to get approved
James Jimothy Cramer, this is your mother. I'm proud of you for pumping GME.
I did!
My god, why the hell are cruises up 10% today
Why is BB going up? I don‚Äôt want to buy high sell low
the business is not profitable at any stock price, this can't go on.

I am watching the puts of 10,000 üåàüêªon Put 40 slip away from them and they will expire tomorrow and team üöÄWSBüöÄ will win.

The average üåàüêª put is $3.25 X 10k Vol x100shares.

We are going to lose them $3,250,000 tomorrow by literally doing nothing.üòÇ

45 EOW PUT THEM IN THE GRAVE
Right. My yield falls off, but I'd still have the actual stocks that I could wait out for it to go back up if it ever does. If it doesn't, ill still have made back (assuming the average remains somewhat the same per year) at least 5k every two years until it tanks. If it lasts 12 years without tanking, I'll have made back my initial investment just in dividends.

A Shahenshah... of WSB... could it be possible?
I have been in and out of energy including XLE in since June.  Sure, it's nice to wish you could have gotten it lower in retrospect but you also have to think about the risks at different points.  Say getting in at $28 on 10/28 before knowing exactly when the vaccines would come out and how effective they would be and whether the cases would explode in the winter, it would have been a pretty risky buy.  Getting in at $34ish on 11/10 after Pfizer phase 3 data came out would be a safer bet.  That's when I started buying heavily.  Now winter cases has kind of plateaued, I think XLE will pretty smooth sailing for the rest of the year as more and more vaccines are distributed and life get back to normal.  Basically the risk for XLE going from $43 to $58 will be a lot smaller than from $28 to $43 in my opinion.

My current energy positions are
2000 shares of SLB
500 shares of XOM
10 XOM Jan22 60C
2000 shares of KMI
1000 shares of XLE
500 shares of LPI

Interesting thought.  I was aware of the "55" rule but didn't know i could roll an ira into the 401k plan.  I have always rolled from a 401k into an ira.

yes, a stop does nothing until the stop price is reached at which time the brokerage enters a market sell order. 

just setting the stop loss doesn't guarantee a sale price though...it only creates a sale at market once the stop price is triggered so if it's on a massive drill you may sell lower than the stop price. you can mitigate this with a stop/limit if you want but i'm generally fine with just a stop if it's something like this where i just want to prevent getting zeroed.
Thank you. Big ups
CRAMER TOLD PEOPLE THEY SHOULD CHECK OUT WALLSTREETBETS BY NAME

I don‚Äôt want to be a Debbie downer. But once you go past 100k start changing your strategy to risk diversification and how to not lose your money instead of yolo aggressive.

So fucking glad I sold GME, rebought GME at the same price, sold again, bought $1 higher, and held overnight. Worth the wild ride.
BLOW UP THE SHORTS!!!!!
There‚Äôs always another day buddy. PLTR leaps is the way to print. 1/21/2022 30c and 50c. Next week should see a little run up in preparation for demo day on the 26th

No mention of green energy in tonight's announcement by Biden, but it will be in his second package "The second package is expected to be centered on job creation and infrastructure, including hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on clean-energy projects like electric vehicle charging stations, along with health care and education spending, Mr. Biden‚Äôs team and leading congressional Democrats have indicated"  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/business/biden-economy.html
DDD price way too low
Have some warrants
Financials have seen a huge power rally with bullish positioning into their quarters before open tomorrow.

All the big names are +50-70% since Nov. This means big institutions are buying in as they‚Äôve been underinvested in banks for years and could take 6-12 months to get their full position.

GS could see 500. JPM 250. BAC 50.

Strong economy + stimulus + higher multiple on a banking subscription model
Bro there‚Äôs like 31 thousand shares to buy on the buy side at 41.30 on GME
We have nothing to lose
>If we hit 55, it'll be a disaster because there's more options at 55 then there are between 41 and 49.

Could you reply on why it'd be a disaster please ? The way I see it, it'd drive price up even more, however I am but a simple retard.
We should be more responsible and diversify. Go 50/50 BB and PLTR.

What happened
GME 42.34 AH im ITM now on my objectively retarded YOLO
You guys can thank me for this run. Last covered call I sold was BYND a day before it ran from $60 to $140. I bought 9,500 shares on Cohen's Fri tweet and sold Feb $30 calls for $1.40 yesterday morning. 

I'm not crying as I had 500 April/July $20s and this was my first two comma trade. I sold the balance of my ITM calls today and rolled a portion into Feb $50s to cover things should we spike to Valhalla.
I'm still +300 EOD today with those calls lol can't explain either
Did aftermarket move?

How has this thread gone on for this long without anyone mentioning Snowpiercer?

i did put $500 yesterday into ACTC and thats gonna be a hold for bidens presidency, what do you think about amazons current price? I feel like it could drop under 3k and then it would be a buy for me

Fuck the shorts baby
I see what you are saying, but to tell people ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like it buy stocks‚Äù is the same as ‚Äúlet them eat cake!‚Äù People posting this stuff are the exact people who will use what you say against you. The stock market is not affiliated with widespread economic success, and that is a problem.
I recommend you to check Pinterest
you‚Äôre confusing 2 different positions you can take.

one is short selling a stock: borrowing (for a small fee) a stock, and selling the borrowed stock, buying it back later, and returning it to whoever you borrowed from. your P/L is (sell price - buy price) - fees paid to borrow.

the other position is being long puts. you buy a contract giving you the right, but not the obligation, to sell 100 shares at the strike price on/before expiry.

Melvin is in on both, but to unwind their puts, they don‚Äôt have to buy or sell the underlying: they just have to sell their puts (or let them expire). To unwind their short selling, they have to buy the stock back, but not at a specific time (margin calls notwithstanding)
That‚Äôs an entirely different announcement
Yeah I may go this route

I'm glad you got more but this still seems like the short end of the stick. They get to not hire another employee (an increase of at least 100% of your total cost) for only a 12% cost increase, they're saving at least 88%. No title change also makes it much harder to negotiate in the future, and only getting 4% more is insulting. Are you going to start looking for another job? Them being such a pain in the ass for the value you're bringing would sour me big time.

WOAH WHY IS BBBY PUMPING NOW. DID CRAMER MENTION IT
I sold all my TSLA to buy more GME and BB but I‚Äôll be back after the squeeze
Honestly, it might raise a bit more imo, but I'd be hesitant if you already have a good payoff. I'm very unsure about if it will increase or decrease at market open, so I'm going the route of not buying.
Set up to the downside like meaning you think the stock is going to fall?
BB the next GME
Bought in APHA and TLRY weeks ago, reaping the rewards as we speak. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs gonna peak around Jan 20. Might blow out when people begin to realize decriminalizing isn‚Äôt going to happen within the first few months.

How do we know if/when they've been margin called?
Advertise GME to all of the newbies to screw Melvin over! Just warn them of how fast shit will hit the fan though, don‚Äôt want them bagholding.
How much more are they day trading vs not day trading?
Boomers will not survive in this autistic wasteland, fuck off over to r/investing instead
Options have two types of value.

The first is the value of being able to buy a stock at a certain price. 

The second is the time left on the option.

So while unexpired options can seem like they‚Äôre worth zero, if there is still time left on the option is still has some value even if that value is a fraction of a cent.
In case one of you newfags are directed here by Cramer after watching Mad Money, buy PLTR tomorrow and lets ride to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Who let this dumbass breed?

Cramer with the "no look pass"!
GME this week was fun, but the real win for me was actually a 300% play on Tilray calls. I‚Äôve rolled the profits from that into some more later dated Tilray calls and *those* are printing too (and that‚Äôs before the opt price reflects this AH fun)

My account is up like 26% this week. It‚Äôs been a good week

Sure, but this isn‚Äôt an argument if you are purchasing a car because you‚Äôd learn within the first day
I would imagine that is likely staying the same.
Yes, but you have to tell them you know what you‚Äôre doing. Someone on this thread explained the button steps to me since I couldn‚Äôt figure it out some time back. In five weeks, I lost $1200 on calls (about 25%).  That being said, calls also made me about 900 today.  I can‚Äôt tell you the button presses to do it.

Also I love you.
Honestly I‚Äôd think about back after things get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  Once we get to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, everything is going to be priced in. 

I was looking at my returns this year and damn...I realized this year was the most I‚Äôd ever put into the market. 

Not traveling, barely spending just meant I had a ton of cash than usual sitting idly....

Not everybody is me, but probably this is a lot of other people out there too. 

The rate of pumping up stock prices just won‚Äôt continue forever when people in the retail sector are circulating money into the economy instead of equities.
Positions?
What‚Äôs pelican room
Dude me too. Usually stick to 4 max and I go on RobinHood and I‚Äôm scrollinggg through my options and stocks haha
Like TRLY
half my account is ICLN 1/21/22 40c's, helps me sleep at night when I'm diamond handing the other half with FD's
I‚Äôm in ü§ì no DD I just saw some rocket ship emojis so I‚Äôm in!
I hope it has a nice morning dip tomorrow so I can buy more.
It's close to 43 AH (10% up). I can't see why this thing can't go on another 60% run tmrw haha, the momentum is strong. Fingers crossed ü§ûü§û
That sounds eerily similar and I agree my pay stubs leave more questions than answers. I might try to do it myself but hiring a tax pro sounds like a good idea....I've only had bad ones (had to explain what RSUs are) so hesitant to go that route
If today was all buying in anticipation of another squeeze.... boy that fall out will be ugly if nothing happens tomorrow.
I did that too. Learning to be a üíé‚úã has been a good lesson.
I would be unstoppable if weed enhanced performance.

16k OI on SRNE LEAPs for 1/20/23, looks like they were bought in November + December so it might be a wait

Cheap LEAPs are my kryptonite man, it genuinely feels like free money

Cramer spent a good amount of time pumping Gamestop.  


Time to pay up old man, get on your eyes and service DFV
fuck sounds like MM was lit tonight, someone got a link?
1.8k is a great profit man. If you can handle the stress of downside risk, hold, if you want to take your profits, sell, if you want the best of both worlds, sell your gains and keep the equity in and enjoy the free stocks.
Why not just buy the weeklong puts in case early next Tuesday sees an even further drop?
Stood on the sidelines until now. 5 shares... im all in
bb to the moon
do i sell BB shares on market open tomo? lemme know in the comments

Another short squeeze üöÄ
Uh oh... Cramer about to bring us from 1.8 million autists to 2.5
It worked out, but it was still retarded
Totally goofed the spelling. Organigram is the correct spelling. I‚Äôm an autist forgive me
Where did they say majority? Where did they say dominated? Is this a strawman?
I feel like it would be a pretty genius move to sell longer dated GME calls right now. No way this sustains for more than a few days and when it fizzles out, the IV crush is going to kill like 90% of the value of most calls.

Just need some iron balls
Yessir! He just went on a huge WSB rant. It was awesome.
Do what you gotta do... but also do what I want you to do
LOL
Yes or near the money.
What film is this?

Mod Cramer please
I'd watch it every day. the advertisers could be robinhood and taco bell.
Deep in VALE options. I have faith üôè
I don't expect there to be anything big in the short term, it's why I bought LEAPs for 2023 and advocate for people to do the same. I do see ERIC being able to grow market share though as countries re-think their exposure to Chinese tech. You're right, the best time to get in on the 5G, it was late 2019, but the leaders and hazards were less clear then. That being said, I do see more infrastructure spending as 5G extends to small and medium sized cities.
When will Biden annoucne infrastructure plan?
Yeah same. 100k contracts per day for 7 days. Let's hope the premium on those goes up as well to slow them down. Does the premium on a stock only depend heavily on the inherent volatility of the stock itself or could massive demand on the call itself raise its price heavily as well? Also like @shark-oil-robot said, people could notice if hundreds of thousands of calls are exercised at a loss.

X for exploration
Why another? Its still the same
Shorts still haven‚Äôt covered even with that last run, and that run is gonna force their hand this next week. This is going to $100 at the least, possibly $420.69 if enough people diamond hand it
I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it. The LOI was sent out in May for a Q4 2020 close. It‚Äôs not uncommon for closings to be pushed back. It takes a long time to get everyone on the same page with the agreements in the LOI. Their attorneys back to read it, revise it, send it back. Your attorneys do the same. It takes a long time. An LOI is a pretty serious thing. It‚Äôs nothing set in stone for sure, it‚Äôs just an intent. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs big.

It‚Äôs not a race to first. America also lies extremely low in safety, education, healthcare, social well being, and social stability. 

Countries that rank highly in these are (primarily) Northern European countries that have higher taxes, but those taxes are used on things that directly benefit the people.

Cramer just spent 3 minutes talking about GME and how WSB is out to get the shorts. He has mentioned WSB twice.

Now he's talking about a post talking about the sub going after WSB.

This is amazing lol. Opening segment too.
Why? Something bad happening?
off to the gulag with you for blaspheming our lord and savior Jerome Powell. BUY STONKS, SHORT THE DOLLAR
**FUCK OFF CRAMER LEAVE US ALONE *REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***
no. BB or NOK now
kinda wish cramer would go more in depth on GME instead of just talking about the squeeze. it would be dope to get RC on lol
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Still you for buying on margin...... but uhhhh good job though.
How do we know how many outstanding shorts left after today? Or i mean at any time. I still feel like the squzze is not yet happened but in this case how to distribute call $ shares? I'm doing 50/50 now. Thx bro.
Take your own advice dipshit the only reason I'm even responding to you is because you tried to convince people to sell. eat shit degenerate
GME can only go up it is knows
Lol! And then I can see this sub getting regulated
Uh...easy there jimbo. You're drawing just a taaaad bit of attention to us. He literally was just reading posts and calling us sketchy, but the type he likes

Which one of you autists is calling in right now
this bill going to be 10,000+ pages this time?
Serious question, what is everyone's exit target price for GME? It was 100 for me but given some analysis of the shorts and how little they have covered so far, i've updated it to 125+ .  This could honestly keep going even further than that and I plan to update my thesis daily. Although I still might lock in some profits once it breaks 100.

What is everyone else thinking?
Remind me 74 days arkx
God, I got killed on Apple today.  I should have sold and went into CRSPR.

I think they‚Äôre going to increase the day trading cap at most. They can‚Äôt really change the options purchasing as it‚Äôll affect the brokerages negatively too much. Banks are cashing in pretty hard with the amount of people entering as well, as they are profiting off the margin calls on retail traders which are at an all time high
Where can I purchase bb from
Go with your gut at the end of the day. Take out your initial investment and leave the ‚Äúhouse money.‚Äù  Also, I wouldn‚Äôt anticipate a crash per se, but more likely would be a correction with those valuations. Don‚Äôt try and time the market. If it helps you sleep, sell some. Act like when you‚Äôre trying to leave a conversation but that person keeps talking to you, one foot out the door and both feet pointed towards the door.
this is the last bastion of all that is great on reddit.
Damn son! That was surprisingly good
**MOOOOOF** üêÑ
Declining performance pre-COVID, shares diluted by like 40% during Covid due to new issuances, and a year of losing $8-9B...sure this is clearly a great investment right now, if you define those purely in that share price is currently low and use to be higher.
Good times

I wonder if cramer ever seen any  of my üöÄüöÄüöÄ comments.
Up 45% üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Cramer is literally telling people to check out WSB & read about how they‚Äôve been planning to squeeze shorts on GME & BBBY. 

What world is this??? lol
114% gain over \~100 days, now down 5.7% from last week's ATH on Friday morning, still twice as high as where it was trading less than four months ago. 

There's no problem with ICLN.

Anyone can explain what does this mean?
My understanding is it'll reduce liquidity, meaning better for the stock price!?
Did you pay attention to what she said was going to crash though?  

Have you seen how well the ARK funds did after the last crash? I have 120 shares of ARKG, 50 ARKQ, 100 ARKF and a few other genomic investments. But my long term stocks are all ARK and TSLA. Considering how ARK actively manages their funds and will buy on the dip, I hope there‚Äôs another stock market crash.
Hey btw I bought calls post market I didn‚Äôt realize what time it was for 10c. Am I fucked now? They ain‚Äôt gonna go through? Bought for like .67 cents

> Oil companies are loaded to the teeth with debt

Beg to differ; oil stocks have *extremely low* levels of debt compared to many other types of company (particularly: CVX, TOT, XOM). Further: most of this debt has been taken on lately at stunningly low rates of interest - almost certainly the right move assuming return on capital invested over 3% ish.

Im high as fuck and this shit ain't bad!!
A fine clip!
CRAMER FULL WSB üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Cramer we are the captains now.
Also, you should always have an exit strategy before entering a trade. This keeps you from making snap judgements from panic. Anyone who has been trading for any amount of time has these kind of stories. I have gotten where I don't even bring them up, I keep them to myself as personal battle scars. If you dwell on them it can cause you to do something even more crazy like a rage all in just before an underlying gets absolutely demolished. Only share the winners.
Fuck that! Only if they were covered. Imagine this actually squeezes after you sell naked calls, rip
worst plays i've ever made were fumbled re-entries.
HOLD
venmo me i will give you a 20% off coupon
tsla is so 2020, it's BB and GME's time to shine boy
Hold.  This is the way
Dude Cramer mentioned your DD today lol
Same with Tbell
depends where in the world you live
There are calculators exactly for this. Just google one there are tons, there are also apps etc
Not sure if [this](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/1/14/6174001-16106192874408154_origin.png?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) is what you're looking for, but it may help.
Oh shit the top is in
Is ICLN going to crash because green energy isn‚Äôt in plan
Hey guys. Checking this place out thanks to Cramer. 

What are options?
What's ITM mean?
Do you think Ford is making a comeback?
When do I sell?
When do I buy?

Brrrrr amiright??? üòÖ
What the fuck did baldy say this time
Cramer just referenced a wbs post pumping a BBBY short squeeze written this morning lmao
Ive never been so disgusted to make 500% on a trade
Could've more than triple that if i held bb for the day
I shorted NIO this week and made $2,578. And that's not saying NIO won't continue to run, but not this week.
damn i went in light in apha calls
You can listen for free online, audio only
This sub needs to be private now
Someone clip Cramer talking about GME and post it
They don‚Äôt close out the positions all at once...
I was soft after like 45 seconds after jerking off to the AH gains

All in on ipof , psth, bft

apple boomer stonk
This is probably the most likely explanation, very easy to digest too
In college, we had a behavioral economics teacher that was incredible. He managed a massive fund for a long time and was basically a baller. Apparently when the university asked him how much he was expecting in salary he said, ‚ÄúOh I don‚Äôt need the salary. What‚Äôs the minimum you can do?‚Äù Turns out the minimum was $50k, so he accepted that and probably donated it. He just loved teaching behavioral economics and I can‚Äôt blame him....seems like the ideal retirement job.
Yes please
Mods if Cramer ever posts on here he needs to be a mod
ARM chips making big splash (see the new Apple M1 chips). AMD presumably making some ARM chips and not Intel based ones. So theres that too
Cramer just pissed all over your dip.
well realistically people said 50s... we're already closing in. The real price was like 120+
I just want to say thank you to all you glorious bastards,  made 2k in 2 days on GME. This is my first big win and I'm still holding! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
We're about to get brigaded by even more retards. We grow stronger.
Wow. Thats...retarded.

TO THE MOONüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
My 20% down GME 44c calls that I held for gap up looking good.
Hey boomers, kindly die off thanks in advance
I was waiting for Cramer to mention u/DeepFuckingValue
Hey is there any doubt after this that you need to hold and not sell?
That's interesting, but I'm not really sure it tells us how / why more strikes get added?  Did I miss something obvious?
Not my move, but i love how every i sell to take some profit, my button press to sell literally triggers the rocket shit and i miss the juicy nectar infused gainz.  i'm not bummed, actually im kind of bummed
Do tell

GME
I still hate Cramer.
So you are saying those could be orders from naked call sellers covering their calls?
Eh honestly I have the same feelings about Tesla and I never bought it because I always felt too late. God damn was I wrong.
Not for weeks
The only downside I see (with most chinese stocks, not Nio specifically) is reporting transparency. Be prepared for lots of embellishment, and some out right fabrications. Still, the fundamentals of China going all electric in the coming decades far outweighs the downside risk.
CITY
Is somebody here smart enough to make a dedicated WSB website for when this place gets shut down
Did Cramer speak on BBBY?
$50? get real.

it's going to $100
he mentioned wsb apparently but thats not why i hate the man. he just looks like my redneck uncles who chug pbr and smell like cigarette butts. his whole aura pisses me off
Does anyone know anything about reverse Morris trust transactions? Essentially, looking to find an easy way to see if the deal is oversubscribed or undersubscribed. I‚Äôm quite sure I‚Äôm dumb and missing something obvious.
thinkorswim
It'll hit 50 tomorow
While I do like plug, I find the IV abit too expensive? But I'll get in if there's a dip. Nio is a long term play
and here i thought you retards were a bunch of clowns gambling on a brick and mortar game store that appears to be dying. To GME squad, I congratulate and salute you
Everyone talking about ‚Äúthe next GME‚Äù kiddos listen up - GME ain‚Äôt over with yet! We ain‚Äôt even at the half way mark üí•üöÄ

üñïMelvin
üêê
Idk but GME goes up -> margin available goes up and I keep buying more... only at $26 avg now but up almost $2.5k... I‚Äôve more than doubled my account in a week after seeing small but good gains for months.
Cramer was just talking about us on mad money and gamestop
Bet, wishing you make 1000. So I get two pizzas
Lol this aged well. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Cramer is obsessed with WSB
Is there a private sub already? I feel like we should start a movement to that, this attention is a lil sketch
Sub needs to be taken off the front page again
*How are people still asking about when Biden‚Äôs thing is? Everyone has been spamming it for days*

Hell no!! üíéüíéüëãüèªüëãüèª
Eh, it‚Äôs usually a brain fart when I forget. It‚Äôs on my calendar, I generally have a plan for what do (sit on my ass and do nothing counts!) but then a coworker will sign off with ‚Äúenjoy your three day weekend!‚Äù and it‚Äôs like, shit, thanks for the reminder again! Where‚Äôd the last few hours go?
$60? This is gonnna squeeze way higher than that!
I got 27.5 for that date but I bought it at the peak lmaooo
GME, 5-bagger, 10-bagger, 20-bagger? Choose your bag

God damn Cramer with the dopamine hitüöÄüöÄüöÄ
If you look at VW 2008 this can go up'n down in an instant. I will set it at 100 and would be fine with it.

What would stop banks from cutting Plaid out and implementing that functionality themselves in future? Just trying to understand the moat here
What did he say
BB?
Balls deep in June calls, checking in.
Name dropped WSB
Manipulate the market.
Yeah from -.4% to -.08%
GME short squeeze is starting to flow over into other stocks....BBBY is doing the same thing....It's been on a tear from $18 to $27 today, and another 4.75% in the AH so far.
https://www.cnbc.com/live-audio/
841, I bought like a monkey with no brain. But that‚Äôs my fault I just thought they‚Äôd go up a little more than they have
What‚Äôre we realistically looking for GME to hit tomorrow? 50? 60? 70?
Cramer actually mentioned us by name.
I think he‚Äôll figure out why we call ppl ‚Äúf-ing retards‚Äù in about 5 minutes of browsing.
This meme fucking creased me up
vtv, vbr
ü¶ì üöÄ üåô
Very possible because I think he said he called them to ask them if they were going to do financing or something?
Also curious. I think we wait for the press conference and go to the moon.
Yes pleas
I bought my first option today. 50x $BB 15c 2/5. I made more on that one trade than all of last year.

No.
Hey money is money. I talk stocks to guys with 100k accounts and 400 dollar accounts. I‚Äôm somewhere in the middle.
Told my co worker about GME and now he thinks I'm a stock expert.

In reality I have no idea what I'm doing.
Why does it laugh
Tesla you‚Äôre such a piece of shit

You have eyes, yet you do not see. Stock price is based on sentiment. There are 1.8 million degenerate stock traders in here. When they decide they like a stock, you need to listen.

Amzn?
Exactly if tax rates go up we are more prosperous. Just think of it as we all put our money in a hat then divide it evenly.
G fucking G man, i have to ask because im worried for you but, are you worried about iv on those apr calls?
DD confirmed.
I don‚Äôt get how it affects the price if there is no shares really dealt. How is there a trade? ELI5?
There was a linked article and DD on /stocks a few days ago. Seemed legit.
Fuck no. Let us have this glorious run then we‚Äôll crash mate. The world will be fine
    [SEC has entered the chat]
I own an Intel CPU.

I own AMD shares.
Still too late for calls?
The bid/ask might be wider, just less buyers. You should be able to sell it as long as it‚Äôs a highly traded stock
weis wave volume
Always has been. 

It's so hard to monitor and find and so widespread it's like looking for a needle in a stack of needles.

Even the rules to help are pointless. CEO has to declare stock sale 6 month in advance of them doing it? Cool cool, just save up all the good news for the week before your pre-annoinced date and drop the bad news afterwards.
Serious question: is there an advantage either way? You either get 100 shares at $8 or 100\*($8 plus $premium) which would be enough to buy 100 shares at that current price.
cant find it on robinhood
The problem comes in not with a legal transgression of the First Amendment, that you are correct only deals with government infringing on the freedom of speech, but that the First Amendment was written in a very different era when the threats to free speech were very different. So, in the 18th century the danger was that if you went into the town square and voiced opinions that powerful people didn't like you might get locked up. The problem now is that today's equivalent of the town square is owned by your Mark Zuckerbergs and Jack Dorseys; you are not in danger of being locked up, just corporate America has been handed the keys to lock you out. So, while there is not a legal violation, there is a disconnect between the law and its intent and the values that underly it. That could pretty readily be legislated away, though depending on how that happened it might actually be a blessing in disguise for social media companies since they would no longer be stuck in a bind between the pressure to censor and the widespread perception that their ability to censor is illegitimate.

In terms of whether any censorship is really justified, I don't see why we would wish social media companies to have any greater latitude in restricting free speech than the government has--which basically boils down to a handful of categories, such as speech that is very directly dangerous (e.g. shouting fire in a pre-pandemic movie theater; calling for someone's murder), or areas such as child pornography. There is also extreme bias in what gets labelled as "dangerous" and how actions are characterized. If they same standard were applied to any organizing of demonstrations, rather than just ones that most of us agree we dislike--particularly ones that result in violence--there would be very few activists of any kind allowed on social media. If the exact thing happened in Caracas or Hong Kong (i.e. capitols of countries where the U.S. government doesn't like the government) as happened here the rioters would have been labelled as "Pro-Democracy Activists" and their deft use of social media would have been applauded (as has already happened in many places around the globe). Every news article or opinion piece that promotes a new war (NYTs being one of the biggest offenders, not having stopped from the straight propaganda that led us into Iraq) would be censored for promoting violence, if not war crimes. Most of us are very happy with the presence of BLM on social media, but think back a couple of decades and you can be very sure that the politics of the day would likely have gotten MLK banned from Twitter, and certainly Malcom X. So, without a transparent standard of course people are going to be uncomfortable with social media corporations being the gatekeeper for free speech.
Enough deep dives, the posts you see with real numbers and information regarding the future of the company, the non-meme posts, we got about 100 on GME and eventually people who don‚Äôt even read them realized how legit it was
Something because the SEC is not gonna say okay here‚Äôs your warning. No, they ain‚Äôt gonna put up with that shit

Why are we still only at 1.8 million? Cramer doesn't have influence anymore?
Comment on the Jim Cramer reference?
It's a fucking $7,000 bet. When you've lost 20-40K in one day - going fucking diamond with $7,000 is fucking nothing.

Watching PLD... pretty boring for this sub but it‚Äôs an REIT focused on warehouse properties with an e-commerce fulfillment strategy.

Like AWS for the Shopify/ShipBob‚Äôs of the world.

Why is BBBY up so much. I literally bought a call because of you guys and I‚Äôm up 120%
I‚Äôve had them on my watchlist, but figured I had plenty of time to get in since it just launched a month or so ago. 

Now I‚Äôm waiting for a dip. :(
I had BB 1/15 8.5C @ 0.08 a contract and sold at 1.00.


I'm super happy with my gains but, I'll looking to get back in for the long term tomorrow morning, anyone else feel the same and what strike are you buying?
now *that's* podcasting, sec!
Is Cramer a real person? His personality is literally something I‚Äôve never seen before. But he doesn‚Äôt necessarily seem crazy
It‚Äôs historically quite volatile and you will be green long term. $150 isn‚Äôt bad especially with promising Q4 results coming out.
this needs to be a copy pasta
Hopping in the dip üöÄ
Boomers gonna FOMO into GME hard tomorrow. 50 by noon

Just buy and hold this tight for 6 months bro. It will pay off.
We've been waiting so long for this moment and now that it's here I almost miss the post-Q4 2020 depression era.

Not gonna lie, I was a little bearish the last month or so. I didn‚Äôt lose too much, I didn‚Äôt win too much. Now, my first couple days back at being fully in bullish mode and I‚Äôll tell you what, IT FEELS GOOD TO BE A WINNER

I was down a $1000 a little over a month ago and now im up 25% $1,500, I'd say panicking, paper hands, and shitty calls before I knew how to buy options was why.  it feels good to make a comeback

Yes sir!
Hottests funds right now are "green energy funds". My fund literally moves like a stock, meaning it makes around 10% a week. Total money machine. Green energy like Tesla in general is a hot investement rn. Im not giving advice this is just my opinion

Quick question, I am holding some TSLA 1200c 2/19, do we have any hope the stock will one day pass the 900 mark, feels like it‚Äôs been stuck in the 840-860 range for days. Or should I sell at a loss and invest elsewhere.
Yup he mentioned both GME and BBBY just a while ago!
The boomers are coming. Wsb is getting too much attention
im gonna buy more weeklies and monthlies and shares after i collect the tendies
Gme to Pluto!

Something to cheer up my fellow ICLN holders "The second package is expected to be centered on job creation and infrastructure, including hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on clean-energy projects like electric vehicle charging stations, along with health care and education spending, Mr. Biden‚Äôs team and leading congressional Democrats have indicated" https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/business/biden-economy.html this is one good too https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/
SOMEONE SIGN THIS MAN
I am from Belgium, so Europe knowledge. Not knowing all taxes arround Europe but I can work with what you give me till now. 

First off congrats on the 5 to 12k ride. Good job. And I see you have a diversified portfolio so on your investments I have the impression you know what your doing.

Without bragging, but that you know where I come from with my advice. I‚Äôve been a financial advisor for some years, now work at an AM on a dealing desk for OTC derivatives.

I will now focus on your wish the be financially independent. Which was my first goal after I had a job.

Now at this point what you have is an upcoming job with 3k a month and +-12,5K in stocks and ETF, right?

You will buy an apartment in Italy. Cuz 100k got a house sounds not possible. I am gonna estimate your housing at 150k to have some margin. Taking a mortgage of 15years will come at approx. 900 a month. Which leaves you with 2100 for monthly expenses. You should be able to save every month between 500 and 1000EUR. I don‚Äôt know your lifestyle and if there is a partner. I take some general assumptions here.

Most important tip I would give you is to build a cash position ASAP when you got the job. Try and get a cashbuffer of 3 to 5K that JUST SITS there and is available at all time. This is some kind of emergency fund. If you have this and pretend you don‚Äôt, it is a cushion to safe you for when you have bad luck. Your car is suddenly ruined, suddenly you washer and dryer die on you, a surprise tax bill,...

Once you are there make sure you utilize any fiscal saving options. In Belgium we can do pension plans which give us the opportunity to save 1k a year in a plan and get 30% back via our taxes. Catch is that you have to keep the money blocked till age of 60. But a garantueed 30% investment is a no brainer. Check with your bank if you got options like this. 

And then I would start pouring in your stock portfolio. 

I do want to remind you that you invested during a period of time in the stockmarket where it was hard to fail. You might wanna take some profit now, keep some extra cash aside until you are settled a bit. You don‚Äôt want to have 15k in the market, for some reason it corrects, you have some extra costs with the new appartement and you become obligated to sell with a loss... try to be prepared instead of getting in that situation.

That‚Äôs it for now üòÇ

Chill, I just started my big boy job and took 2k from my 401k put into a brokerage and sent it all because of WSB big brains on my very first investment.

Twenty-two years old making 65k in Florida, don‚Äôt worry, my time will come ;) I‚Äôm entirely new to this.
what stock was this
For all you boomers coming to the sub right now just going to let you know you should sell everything in your 401k because that shit is going at a turtle speed and buy ICLN instead

You can either exercise your call and buy those shares or (as most people on here do) sell the contract for a profit
Use stimmy to Pay off credit < gamble on bb
Thanks
My guess (and this is just a guess) is that they won't undo anything that makes them look like they are Chinese puppets. If they undo it, it's going to be low on the priority list.
i‚Äôve heard mumbling of something like that. either way, more regular members are on the discord so that‚Äôs one way to filter out people.
Hey all you new to WSB sent to us by Daddy Cramer. If you want in on tomorrow‚Äôs short squeeze get your BB while you can.
It‚Äôs crazy! I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre loving it.
Yep, Gamepass --> Gamepass xCloud --> Remote access to supercomputers and every single thing you could ever want to do.

What‚Äôs the strike price for the squeezed contract?
2/12 I just want to hold through Biden‚Äôs inauguration I believe it‚Äôll pump once he‚Äôs in office
Favorite is Nio -  I bought in at under $40 and held. I really loved the look of that SUV when I saw it. It looked better than most EV's for my taste and now the sedan is even cleaner. I hope they made a coupe 2 door soon.

Most profitable is Apha - bought in super cheap and i'm at 93% profit

Runner up: DDD I bought in around $11 which I thought was high and then sold at $24 ... all of it. It's now $31 but i'm not crying over it
I think there is much more to it, but I would be cautious and maintain a stop loss

There are only two questions:

1. When to take the profits?
2. What colour Tesla do you want?
Don‚Äôt even know the company name And I threw a $100 at it. Fuck it got money to fuck around with.
SO MUCH MORE MONEY FLOWING INTO BB!!!!!!
Okay final final question here so sorry you've been incredibly helpful.

If I sell to close, am I hoping that someone else picks up the contract, or do I just get to drop the contract right then and there and move on my way?

squeezes
Great! Especially Facebook
Does anyone know if SEC could actually do something to us? I mean we do DD with rocket emojis... so it's legit.
Have you seen him in person? Could be a hologram or something
Yes
Sold my pltr today to double down on BB.
So when does the short interest data come out for GME? Supposed to be on the 15th. If its low it could start the sell off. If it's high, I'm buying everything
All depends on what your hands are made of
Question on LEAPS pricing

Why is the break even on deep ITM LEAPS less than it is on OTM Leaps with the same expiration?

For instance: GME 230120C

$2 strike $37.90 cost = $39.90 break even

$10 strike $30.60 cost = $40.60 break even

$20 strike $25.75 cost = $45.75 break even

$40 strike $20.23 cost = $60.23 break even

$55 strike $15.63 cost = $70.63 break even

Aside from just buying the underlying, what am I missing?
let's do it

PLEASE POST VID OF CRAMER
Up until now I‚Äôve lost so much money trading. I used to get traumatic flashbacks whenever I heard people talking about stocks and gains around me.

Currently I‚Äôm 66% up on GME. Now I can‚Äôt stock refreshing my WSB, and my stock twit feed üòäüòä
I don't want to get blamed when he loses money
I got out. I don‚Äôt know, feels like they would‚Äôve said something by now to capitalize on the hype.
In for 100 more shares in addition to the 50 I had.
i really think he will. as retarded as we are here we make some fucking money. the people in charge dont like that. ive been seeing more and more articles mentioning wsb and i just got a feeling in the next year or two with this type of exposure us and retail investors in general are gonna hit with all types of new regulations
Whats the next meme stock after BB and GME?
Also first time taking part in an Autist Play. Bought 44 shares on market open and lost like 200 bucks in 5 minutes but I held those fuckers with my infinity gauntlet and now I am sitting inside the üöÄ
ARK‚Äôs are literally the only thing making me money rn. Apples been flat and PLTR, well, I‚Äôm sure you can guess...
Yea, it helps with luck and extreme volatility. Most other times they would expire worthless but this was a great fucking bet given the timing
It‚Äôs because every highly shorted stock rn is getting squeeze cause there afraid the same will happen to them like Black berry
if you don't need the money dont sell plug...its only just started.
Melvins tendies gonna look so good in my account
Lol I bought one contract but it‚Äôs my first options trade I just wanna see what happens. I am a newby so with options do you sell the call?

Aren't there still concerns that US exchanges are going to de-list Chinese companies or was this resolved?  I also know public perception is that Biden will be "weaker" on China but in hindsight China abused Trump for four years.
Booyah!!!
Your response hahahah
For the love of god choose PLTR
Add those together and theres your answer
brokerages share the same options chain, the stock you're looking at just doesn't have further expiration dates yet
Not on robin
What app is this?
I had already bought the 2/19 8c at open after seeing some posts last night and being on the fence about it. Saw the money printer warm up and sold some other positions to get a Sep. 9c and a 2023 10c. Let's fucking GOOOOOO!

Hey thanks
dude just invest it in VTSAX and leave your money alone. there's no shame in it at all
had my finger on the buy trigger for BBBY today but switched to ICLN. Better not have been a big fuckup
How the fuck is investing in stocks you believe in manipulating the market, GME had about 5 different indications that it was massively undervalued based on profits, leadership, console drop, shift to e-commerce, shorts, so obviously people wanted in
he said he called to tell them to issue shares lol
I was once a doubter, but now I'm committed
I‚Äôd recommend an options broker my friend.   Trading options on SPACs would work on a SPAC with this type of setup.

If not, I‚Äôd stick to SPACs closer to NAV.
If you‚Äôre selling calls, you should be nervous. This is euphoria on steroids. Buy calls, hold shares, ride to Valhalla

 A blue-chip stock is a stock that comes from a well-known, established company.
So, sort of new to this, would we sell GME tomorrow or home through the weekend
Because if OP is right all the data points to a drop tomorrow, not Tuesday, and weeklong puts will have theta priced in (and 500%-700% IV) whereas OTM 0-day FD's will be significantly cheaper.  


For example if GME hits around $45-48 tomorrow then a $40 FD put will be selling for pennies (probably 30 to 40 cents), and if he's right that's an easy 20-bagger. On the other hand if I buy a $40 put for the following week it would probably cost $4-$5 and have it's unlikely GME would drop down any lower than $20 (and I doubt it would go that low), which would be at best a 4x to 5x gain.
Just posted the same thing then I saw this. It‚Äôs nice to see the big boys take notice. I just hope the strategy doesn‚Äôt get fucked because of it
Take it all and invest in BB for real
This is the way
Sometimes, you gotta be a little crazy to keep yourself from going crazy...same rule applies to retarded
Didn't read, count of rockets in post = 5, so buying more GME.
Holy shit we fucked Melvin 2 times this last week. They are short BBBY AND GME
Should i grab calls tom morning?
Thanks!
Pretty soon there will be more SPAC EV makers than there are customers at this rate.
As i mentioned in my DD, I think this one is a slow grinder. They broke some news yesterday that they're offering I believe $900m in sustaniblitiy linked senior notes, which is why they've had an epic gain so far this week. 

&#x200B;

I've closed most of my Jan/Feb calls, but holding everything else. Jan 2022 and 2023 leaps are crazy cheap still.

FML. Congrats again to GME bagholders.
Oh my yes. Couple of times we would take coho salmon straight off the boat and throw it on the bar's grill. Probably a health code violation, but meh.
The reason BABA stock dropped had nothing to do with Trump, but rather that Jack Ma disappeared and the CCP is probably going to break up the company. With the exception of things like Aliexpress, almost all of Alibaba's business is domestic. While I hope it is not the case, I am very bearish on BABA for the time being.

$40 strike $20.23 cost = $60.23 break even

$55 strike $15.63 cost = $70.63 break even

Aside from just buying the underlying, what am I missing?
In on BB at $10.20ü§†
I think the primary purpose of WSB from this point forward should be to punish all short sellers and initiate short squeezes. Fuck DD, fuck earnings, fuck all that. Short squeezes only.
That would be my guess. DFV alone would drive 100k share purchases, and there are tons of other 1/15 calls expiring tomorrow ITM
Mods can we ban this retard?

Is Cramer a mod yet
VTV has a solid portfolio if you want an ETF, most of its top holdings are solid value + quality plays 

Otherwise you kindaaaa missed the best value investing time (March-october) when value companies were a lot cheaper. For example Disney was $120 now $175. JPM was $90 now $140. But my favorite companies that hit the ticker of not too high of a valuation (higher than a 25 pe and/or higher than a 2 PEG) are MRK, JPM (BAC, BLK and GS as well), UNH, LMT, GOLD, VRTX and BRK.B

It's good. Normally boomers are to stubborn for wsb but your dad embraces the new era of trading so he is welcome on the rocket ride!
Not worth the risk at all
70% in a week on a rumor

Is Cramer a mod or trying to start a new sub r/wallstreetcirclejerks ?

I'll check back in December 2022 to confirm.
With 200k income... they are going to waste a lot on taxes doing the conversion ladder.
do it
If they offer shares before the squeeze, they will cuck us so hard.
fuck you.

Congrats.

Do no harm (unless it's to short sellers).
With a full tank at the beginning of their shift I don't think that happens often.  Probably have drones chasing us soon so perhaps car chases will be a thing of the past.
It‚Äôs not buying to manipulate the market retard, GME is a good company with good leadership so people wanted to buy the stock, it‚Äôs also illegal to sell naked shorts beyond the amount of shares available but Melvin did it
Yes
Been holding LXRX for 6 years now. Got f‚Äôd when they did a reverse split. This is the closest I‚Äôve been to being green on this stock in a long time.
ya, I stop loss and loss.. was doing well this year until GME fomo, haha.. good wakeup call
Damn Cramer gonna blow this place up. He even knows about the rocket emojis!!!

As long as you don't buy and sell the same equity/instrument the same day you are good (atleast until you hit a million). As for DD don't mention that, as the more work you do, the more of a job it is, which is the criteria for not being an individual tfsa. Remember you can't sell cash covered puts, but you can sell cash covered calls, and can only trade equity/instruments that are available on the listed exchanges (ie: no otc).
This post was 100% a flex of ur setup, but it‚Äôs nice nevertheless.
They better pay me in pltr shares... hopefully lin is cool with it
Bought BB after hours after hearing about it all day and it‚Äôs still been mooning... what the hell!
That's like crying during sex, and for the wrong reasons. But I'd still take it.

I didn't buy the option back, but even if I had this morning first thing it would have worked out even better (hindsight being what it is, of course). I also thought about rolling it over to a Feb option, but at this point that strategy would have just compounded my losses. I'm just gonna take my win, hopefully learn a lesson, and try not to cry during sex.
Calls are infinite money
I'm not denying that at all but I wouldn't want to take that risk uncovered is all just in case something even more crazy were to happen.
This sub has long forgotten about TSLA. What is it? We only talk about GME now

How do I always pick stocks that go red right away and fade into nothing
I had sold all my shares and took profits before it went down around that time, but I bought that 4-month out call around then since I was hoping for a steady recovery. I'm not even gonna cry about it, it was a informed decision and pretty rational from PLTR's behavior and news on gaining contracts to buy it.
Oh, fuck me [I am retarded.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYmn3Gwn3oI)

Land a new job in a derivatives trading department.
this is why you hold when others panic sell. take notes retards.
I agree.

But I also see a company like NKLA which is a proven fraud still trading at 2/3 of their ipo price months after the fraud was announced.

The amount of dumb money in the market can sustain this valuation for an uncomfortably long time.

My primary position is Aug 110p, not sure how smart that is anymore, but I‚Äôm waiting for the ipo lockup in March before making any correction.
I just watched jimmy chill talk about this situation on mad money. 

It's funny how shorting a stock is ok... But what has been happening here is questionable. 

Keep it up folks those short people are doing the same thing you are but with leverage from the market makers. 

Hopefully the company doesn't print any shares while it keeps going up.
Holy shit the WSB ETF must be fucking ripping right now
I was going to question whether shorting struggling companies was no longer a viable strategy in the age of social media with all these turnaround tickers, but then I remembered Melvin have been making $$$ for years shorting GME and they just didn't keep on top of their DD/got greedy.

The cost of doing business üöÄ
Having a higher salary makes it easier but overall principles still apply (invest early and invest as much as you can).

So you might not be a quick as someone making 70-100k starting but you‚Äôll still be able to FIRE reasonably.

That being said as long as you‚Äôre doing stem in a popular field (ME, EE, SWE) and are looking for jobs in a popular area 65-70k is *really* not that much for a company who‚Äôs paying most of its employees in the high 120-150ks
They've already blown every trial phase out of the water  
Not approved odds are the same as GME tanking
I agree with the general sentiment here; there is no perfect time, YMMV, and you sound emotionally and financially able.

I waited until I was nearly 40 to start. I'm mid-40s and had my third kid a few months ago. There are pros and cons. I'm pretty far along in my career and can get time away from work without risking stagnation. I have already built a fair NW and can afford pretty much whatever I want/need for the kids. On the other hand, damn is it tiring. I lift a few times a week and run/bike a few times a week, so I'm in reasonable shape, but damn is it tiring. And, I'll be in my 60s (!?!) when they leave for college. I also may not live long enough to see my grandkids.

FWIW - regardless on when you plan to start, if you're considering saving in a 529 plan, start now. You can open it in your name, put in whatever you can afford each month, and once you have your child, transfer it to them. This will give you potentially several additional years of saving for college for your kid(s).

Whatever you decide, it's a personal decision. There is no right or wrong time. You sound like you've got all the prerequisites covered.
This is my goal too. I'm starting med school in the Fall and hope to go in with hella gains on hand
I have joined bbby train as well to fuck Melvin. Enjoy losing money ya fucking elitist pricks

$SRNA was my ride today, honestly think it has a lot more gas left in the tank!
Funny commentaryu about 420.69 aside, this stock is going to keep going up like a rocket to at least 65 as long as everybody stays the course.

&#x200B;

Right now, the shorts are having to buy even MORE shorts further out in the hopes of leveraging their way down over time after we lose interest and sell.  But the more shorts they buy, the more we choke the market, and the more they have to buy...

&#x200B;

We're basically putting them through the same vicious cycle they have historically put retail investors through.

Well the first bill destroyed jobs by raising the minimum wage to $15.

Question on LEAPS pricing

Why is the break even on deep ITM LEAPS less than it is on OTM Leaps with the same expiration?

For instance: GME 230120C

$2 strike $37.90 cost = $39.90 break even

$10 strike $30.60 cost = $40.60 break even

$20 strike $25.75 cost = $45.75 break even

$40 strike $20.23 cost = $60.23 break even

$55 strike $15.63 cost = $70.63 break even

Aside from just buying the underlying, what am I missing?
What time am I selling my 49c tomorrow ? GME obviously

15% in a bull market is normal. You‚Äôre forgetting that the benchmark average of 8-12% is accounting for red years as well. In a bull market it‚Äôs not uncommon for annual returns in the 20 and 30% ranges.

Possibly
Elvin Capital sells a share to WSB autist at $40. If Elvin Capital sells 10M shares like that, then the price tanks.

Two days later when the clearing agency tries to deliver the shares to WSB autist broker account, but turns out Elvin Capital did not have the fucking shares, and issues an IOU, which needs to be settled ASAP. But it is already too late, because Elvin Capital's actions already impacted the price two days ago and put a massive brake on the momentum. 

This is called naked shortselling and it's illegal.

Everyone said Biden was announcing his infrastructure plan tonight, but what I'm seeing is its only his stimulus plan and the infrastructure one won't be released until Feb.

Hope you're not balls deep in clean energy still.

I‚Äôd like to be part of this group! Could you tell me more about the equitable arrangement? Thank you.
sick gains.  but to be honest making then wsj gonna put the spotlight on you from irs/sec so be careful bro.
Hey tesla everything is mooning but you. BB is up more dollar wise than you after hours and you are worth 80X it. Get your shit together pissy ass Elon

If everyone pushes their sell limit orders ridiculously high, shorts can‚Äôt borrow shares correct?
nothing sadder than selling BB calls this morning because they made 100% return and I was tired of losing money holding BB bags

Hey guys my total gains % Since I started investing is 69.69%
I have $10k I can use tomorrow. I will be okay if I lose it all. What do you guys think I should go big in?
Like, actually a walk away move? Just chuck 75% of it into a total stock ETF and 25% into a bond ETF and come back when you retire.
Someone's a little salty today.  Did you manage to read beyond the title, or did I trigger you too hard?

I don't think it's worth now. The fact that they celebrate their victory already.
Initially they he will probably get a small increase,  but not nearly what the minimum wage people will see.  It takes a long time for companies to be able to raise their prices enough to cover these spikes in costs.  I read an article that calls this ‚ÄúWage Compression‚Äù....when the pay rates between the two tiers is artificially closed.  In my business it has taken a few years for me to be able to get back to similar percentages of different pay rates between my skilled and unskilled positions.
   This is just what I have seen in my business and local economy.

Thanks man

We're self-admitted retards, so I think there's some federal protection for us.

Damn that sucks. Robinhood might not offer this ETF. My friend who works in ICT recommended me this and I looked into it. Fund was started in May 2020 and is already up 90% and still extremely underpriced
No one cares about TSLA anymore. GME is our main chick right now.
51 shares @ 3.72 back in August 2019. It's been a wild ride up to this point. Hoping we can go even further.
I live in a state where it's $15 an hour and it resulted in more minimum wage workers getting fired than anything. Less workers at McDonalds these days, they have kiosks to order, and higher prices.
Changes to their board
Aight help me with this. Let's say GME hits 53 tomorrow right? And I have 2 contracts. That's basically only 2000 bucks. I get what I paid for it back too right? So like ~2500?

Am I missing anything?

If GME doesn‚Äôt hold these gains or goes a bit into red it‚Äôs gonna be a bloodbath
So funny thing, this doesn't actually work. I messed around with it after this post. RH wont let you buy a call and sell weeklies against it for less than the strike of the call. for obvious reasons.
My dude that is the way. I thought I was gambling when I bought em at $15

In the article it says Cohen bought 9% of the GME with 5.8 million shares for roughly ~ $5.39 a share or $31.26 million. 

At $42.80 after hours that is now almost $250 million.

That‚Äôs a 700% gain.
Bought in after some DD on WSB last week:

30 1/21/22 10c +86% today
40 1/21/22 12.5c +108% today

It ain't much, but LEAPs be that way I guess.

Good luck! I did my undergrad in econ and finance, and I'm headed back for my masters of accounting this summer.
My thought is if I exercise the call and have shares I can write weekly calls while the IV is high. Write like a 13 call for next week. Probably collect $200 to write it in the morning and then worst case scenario the stock closes over 13 next week and I sell my shares for 13 still making another 500
Yup, bigtime

It's up less than a %after hours...
V & MA are up on the year with having lost fairly significant revenue/income yoy in 2020, that‚Äôs actually pretty incredible. Even then 2021 going forward should be better for them with more shift away from cash.

MSFT & AMZN had fantastic run ups in the past year, a consolidation period is good for them.
You should also know that I have no fucking idea what I‚Äôm talking about, I bought 1/15 40c at 30 and sold at 34 yesterday.
I watched this and didn‚Äôt react this morning like an idiot.
BB
For me, today's show  (so far) is exactly what I'm looking for. No negativity. His explanation of the short squeeze was supplemented by his real world experience and we couldn't have gotten that story from anyone else. The definition, sure we can use google, but the definition along with Cramer's experience with the banks? That's unique to his show.

Cramer has always been one of my favorites, and that's why I felt so slighted when he started trashing on us. I hope everyone else is pleased with is recent change as well.
Serious question. Normally it would take 6 days for shorts to cover because of our 7 million average volume however today our volume was 100 million. Wouldn't that mean the squeeze would last a day?.

Just happened to me recently because after hours bullshit with MARA, got in around 15, had a trailing limit and it opened down when BTC dumped, but Mara recovered the same day, before I got back in the price was like $24, missed out on pretty much $5/share because of that lapse in time. Lesson learned, prob only set them if I‚Äôm on vacation in the future

No need to be included in that bill since he can do that himself without congress
Suppose there are only 100k people investing based on wsb memes and each person is poor so they have only 10k. That's GME's market cap a few months ago. Even though I'm just making up numbers I think they illustrate the point that WSB has a significant amount of capital reading the sub. Combined with the short squeeze effect I don't think it's unreasonable to say WSB played a big role in GME booming.
started doing that today

You really have to ask? Come on, you know the answer to the question.
GME is the ultimate stock russian roulette, those who timed right and sold for a profit and those who baghold and are sucking dick behind a wendy's for rent.
Ofcourse. I am getting new $BNGO vibes from $CHEK. It's actual physical product and not some kind of medicine and stuff. Sooner or later they will be out in news with their FDA approval and stuff and this thing is gonna sky rocket.

Fellow 57 y.o. here in the same boat! My husband (53) and I basically did the same thing ‚Äî invested in our 401(k)s as our primary savings (started when I was 25 I think), and then ... just made more money than we spent.  I have received a lot of stock from my company and the company has done well, and this has made all the difference for us because we are really not financially-focused people.  We finally hooked in with a financial planner a few years ago with the plan being to figure out how to make sure we could retire someday and if there was any chance of doing it in our 50s, and he kind of laughed at us (kindly) for being so worried.  He looked at our net worth (which is about $3M at the moment) and was like, you guys, you can absolutely retire in your 50s. We never dreamed we‚Äôd be in this position, seeing as we haven‚Äôt exactly been deliberate about it.  So we‚Äôre thrilled ... But we don‚Äôt know what we will retire TO, so it‚Äôs weird.  I definitely want to stop working my high-powered job and my husband is just done as well, but we have no plan except to be done with working in about a year.  ANYWAY, congrats on realizing you may be closer than you think.

Hold your shit together, ICLN gang. Grandma has just told me not to panic as her lover, buydem has just used margin to buy some ICLN while we awaits for his first paycheck.

Quick dumb question about return on investment.

When calculating your max return on investment when selling a cash secured Put, do you use the full collateral as the denominator or do you use the collateral less the premium earned?

For example: If I sell a $10P for $2 in premium, is my max return on investment:

*  $2/$10 = 20%, OR is it 
* $2/($10-$2) = 25%.

I've always worked it out the first way, but it occurred to me that if I get to reinvest the premium does that mean my collateral is actually net of premium?

Also, how do you calculate ROI on covered calls?

Thanks in advance

Seriously, as a beginner I threw some money at Tesla for 2 days and made 160. Did I know what I was doing? Absolutely not. Took an uncalculated risk and it paid off - do I get to be smug about it now?

Are you saying that reading 10ks is not what you should be doing? are you suggesting that you should be following good hedge funds and just making the same moves as them? Let me know how you track the best hedge funds, I bet that is really easy information to find. Let me know which managers have the best track record. It's too funny how na√Øve you are honestly. Are you saying that you cannot have a theory on the future of a company, and make accurate predictions based on that? You think hedge funds conduct their own market trend research? "The best stock pickers in the world are hedge funds". This might single handedly be the funniest thing I have ever heard, gratz

It‚Äôs over for us lads.
Probably the same $75K, but this is a proposal- have to actually go through congress and the senate to pass the free money drop...
Small?  Why not have conviction in your belief and go all in on the short.   I mean you just said no company has run up like this and it not pop.   And I never said that the bubble won't pop.  It will if it is a bubble.   See the difference here?  I am long Tesla and I will not even make the prediction one way or another as I am not stupid enough to believe I can time the market in any significant way.   If you do that it is much more likely you got lucky then just your amazing ability made you money.   I mean if most people could successfully do that consistently they would be billionaires.    

The nature of predictions is idiotic.   If you say something enough it will probably come true.   But if you make a prediction 10 times and are right once you are pretty shit at predictions.    More important then knowing if there is a bubble is when it will pop.    That is the thing here.   You could be completely right  that it will happen but if you are a month early then you were wrong.  Doesn't matter if you called it.  Timing is everything and if you don't get that right the rest of teh prediction is useless. 

It is like saying that historically that the stock market has crashes or the economy has recessions.   Well thanks for letting all of us know this information that everyone knows.   What matters is not that it happens it is when it will happen.   Do you not think that every long knows it is possible for the share price to pull back?   So until you can time it then making a prediction just so you can say told you so is meaningless.
We are getting invaded by newfriends
We aren't plotting to blow up shorts.  THey were fucked either way.  We are just riding along (and maybe making it a bit worse)
How much money you want ?
With a move of +50% in one day volatility spikes.

So examples- For the last week the price hasn't moved much so I say I'll sell you a call with a 50$ premium because it will probably expire worthless. You don't buy it. 

After the price doubling I say-- "I don't want to sell you a call and only make 50$ off of it! That shit has the chance to maybe increase 200% or something. I'll sell it to you for 300$ premium now"

You buy it

But if the price stays flat for a day or two after you buy then what are chances it will change drastically? Probably less. So now this other person comes along and says - "Fuck you! I'm not paying 300$ premium. It has barely moved up the last two days and it will probably expire worthless. I'll give you 100$ premium."

So maybe it moved in the direction you wanted but you still lost money because you bought a call when there was a big chance it would moon.

Hope this helps
Yooooo, I thought I put in more months ago but it's was sadly a few shares. Still happy to see it boomin though!

That's just not true at all. Expected console sales were already priced in. It's not like the console release was a surprise that came out of nowhere. It's pretty well known gme didn't get many given to their stores too. That exact number won't even be released till April. 

The short squeeze hasn't even happened yet either. 

The only big catalyst is Cohen and the two other chief executives joining leadership to rebuild gme's business model.

I agree, my thinking now is that government and central banks will do whatever they need to do to keep things going. The low rates help a lot because borrowing is basically for free.

Then we will get the post COVID boom. People are sick of being locked up and not being free. They will go in overdrive when vaccins are done and Covid is under control. 

But then it is time to make sure you leave the party before everyone wants to get out. Exact timing is hard.. I learned that the market can be irrational for a looong time. The challenge is set.
Oh well that‚Äôs my view on it, we will see what the future brings. If vaccins start failing or mutations get out of hand, this story will play out differently.

I suppose this is considered DD from a stock valuation standard which isn't wrong in the current way the market is operating. I don't personally consider this a DD because I look at fundementals; which I know is out of the window in the current market.

I get that this person is joining and he could be switching the company around, but there is 0 mention of an actual laid out plan in place of what to do with the company.

You could say it will become an AI 5G Machine Learning lemonade selling only fans account. Who cares? We don't own the company and whatever day dreams people have of what it should do does not result in what it WILL be. Only owners/execs can decide what it will become and there is yet to be a vision on that.

P.S. When I say plan, I mean something like what AMD has. I invested in 2017 because I saw their CPU, it was a testable product, I saw their competition, and I can actually research their plan. That was an excellent buy. I can't say the same about GME, there doesn't seem to be any legitimate plans.

Thanks for sharing that link and congrats on the gains.
I spent my first 6 years post college making 30-40k a year (PhD program). You want one of two things: 1) a job you enjoy so much that you don‚Äôt need to rush to retirement because it isn‚Äôt soul crushing, and hell, you might even keep doing it even after you read fi or 2) a high income so you can minimize the length of your working career. 

There‚Äôs no way around the income part when it comes to early retirement, save for if you compensate by living a (sometimes prohibitively) frugal lifestyle. I sacrificed some of (2) in order to get more of (1) personally so if marketing suits you that should be sufficient. But for me the goal is happiness over FI. FWIW, I wholeheartedly recommend that outlook to others :)
This is the way.
For me, today's show  (so far) is exactly what I'm looking for. No negativity. His explanation of the short squeeze was supplemented by his real world experience and we couldn't have gotten that story from anyone else. The definition, sure we can use google, but the definition along with Cramer's experience with the banks? That's unique to his show.

Cramer has always been one of my favorites, and that's why I felt so slighted when he started trashing on us. I hope everyone else is pleased with is recent change as well.

Price increase as a combination of covering their soon expiring short position by buying the stock AND due to delta hedging by market makers.

A large put position can be supplied by market makers however, market makers aim to be delta neutral. Simply, when market makers sell a put they in effect take a "bullish" position therefore, to be neutral, they need to offset this with a "bearish" position by shorting the stock. When market makers start selling calls to those wanting to get into the price action from short covering, this bearish position can also be offset by the market makers being long on the stock, which in turn, can further exacerbate the upward price movement.

Tldr: GME üöÄüöÄüöÄ bc of üåàüêª covering their expiring puts by buying the stock, which is amplified by market makers buying more stock.
How can is be stupid when GME will rise maybe 20% and ATVK maybe 100%

Tldr: GME üöÄüöÄüöÄ bc of üåàüêª covering their expiring puts by buying the stock, which is amplified by market makers buying more stock.

This makes zero sense how can they be doubling down on their shorts they can't be that fucking stupid. There's no way to rationalize this. What the fuck.
Tsla usually gap up alot after market
so what Cramer's really trying to say is that it's not a good investment to impregnate an Instagram model? They're not mysteriously wealthy and living on a beach? yes, I see..
I meant yoloing
Nice
I checked SHO too today. At one point it has to have some sort of impact. Either the shorties bleed to death and it automatically dries up all shorts, media starts pumping the GME story even more and the banks take notice, Bidens SEC team gets interested or the shorties start suing WSB for market manipulation. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Although the gains aren't quite as flashy as Weekly's, you can make a shit ton of money off of them. Leaps are great for that. As soon as the stock price passes your strike price you not only virtually negate Theta Decay, you also start to see massive jumps in gains

As it gets deeper in the money, you're leveraging that against the stock gains. $1 stock gain should net $1 intrinsic value gain in premium, or $100 overall gain on the leap

Dude people have been saying the market is ‚Äúundeniably overvalued‚Äù and ‚Äúdue for a crash any day now‚Äù since like the 80s. Once you get over yourself you‚Äôll realize that investing isn‚Äôt a straight up guaranteed 10% a year for life game and that there are going to be down periods. The best thing to do is own your assets. If you held and continued buying in the 2000‚Äôs you were rewarded nicely in the 2010‚Äôs. 

The whole point of an s&p500 etf is that you hold it for several decades and let it do it‚Äôs thing.

We should definitely call that shit out. Also call out pumpers who like to do 1 day pumps and make tons of bag holders.

Honestly I'd probably give myself the hall of shame flair every time my stocks drop to remind people: if I buy, your stock is guaranteed at the top and will plummet :)
PLTR is harder to squeeze. The market cap is much larger, so retail buying does have as much of an effect.
Yeah I've realized I'd be a lot richer if I let winners run. Even if I never sold anything I'd be better off. 

Take profits if you want,  but a good idea doesn't stop being a good idea if it's run up. I also try to invest in companies that I'd be fine leaving alone if I went into a coma, less in ones that I'm twitchy looking for a one day pop.

That‚Äôs not a logical analysis. If Italy and USA couldn‚Äôt detect the new coronavirus in November/December 2019, why aren‚Äôt people saying that ‚ÄúUS and Italy hid the virus‚Äù?

US media:

‚ÄúCCP has lost its heavenly mandate‚Äù

‚ÄúNovel coronavirus is China‚Äôs Chernobyl‚Äú

‚ÄúDemocracies Are Better at Fighting Outbreaks‚Äù

You need to replace the whole unit, per motherboard:

>The issue is with a flash storage chip called the eMMC that is embedded on a board called the MCU1. According to experts who have studied the problem, Teslas are writing vehicle logs to this flash storage chip so much that it eventually goes bad. The issue has been known in the Tesla community since at least May, when Tesla repair YouTuber Rich Benoit spoke to another Tesla repair professional named Phil Sadow about it in a video.

It's embedded, so it's not an easy fix.

People need to realize what a squeeze is, this GME play might be my last on WSB, I'm getting tired of all the newbies

Not a premise.  Look at the VW short squeeze and others the are TEMPORARY don't delude yourself to equate stock price with value.

This is the better question.
it says "value investing". I feel robbed.
To be fair, there‚Äôs value in learning from your mistakes and there‚Äôs value in being cautious too. Those who do neither will continue to fall until someone steps in. It sounds like you might want to talk to your aunt, if her finances matter to you or you care about the impact, about being more conservative, taking a different approach, or avoiding trading entirely. 

When the euphoria of this sub gets the best of you and you do a YOLO based on no conviction of your own only for it to plummet, that learning experience is invaluable because it gives you the opportunity to develop your mindset and look at similar scenarios with experience.

True, but even failures caused by sequence of returns risk in the first few years often don't actually "happen" until 20+ years later, by which point you're pulling on SS. Even with only a 75% payout, Social Security benefits are too high to completely ignore either. For lower absolute withdrawal numbers/expenses, SS offers a relatively larger replacement of income. Not super relevant if you're retiring at 30 and your model fails by 60, but if you're retiring at  40 it seems reasonably to at least consider it a factor.
this is the geekiest thing ive seen in a long time.

Completely understand. I am extremely, relatively, new to all of this. I do read a shit ton all day while I‚Äôm working from home during the pandemic. I browse the internet, utilize Reddit a ton (shout out everyone here for the efforts), and other forms of DD.

I only recently started trying this penny stock thing out - like literally maybe 1-2-3 weeks ago?.. After getting a good foundation of diversified companies in my portfolio (TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, AMD, NGM etc), I saw the opportunity to play with some cash I (hypothetically) earned from them. I saw a post on something that caught my eye. I believe it was TLSS, PTE, or BBI. I‚Äôve researched up a ton on this and read many of the DD posts here.. 

I also bounce the ideas off of some acquaintances who are in the healthcare industry, so the bio/pharma/medical companies.

Long story short, these cheap penny stocks can make pretty fantastic money (in my opinion) from the looks of things (if they check out of course). Say you have 2-300$ to play with and you think all of your research is making sense, timing seems good, there may be an opportunity. Make sure the management is aligned with their shareholders and are mutually respected/admired for their work ethic and that WE believe in them!

There are some opportunities that just by hearing the premise of the business, I have put say 200$ into it. I will say most of these have impressed me so far. 

Best of luck to you! Feel free to ask any other questions and I‚Äôll try to answer them for you.

If I knew for sure I was rich. I believe it has a future, do I took a position. But only for 50% of what I want to invest in it. I keep the rest in cash and wait it out a little. I am in there making money, but if it dips or corrects I can buy some more at much cheaper prices. 
If you believe in the theme, then time in the market is better then timing the market mate ;-)

I think this will help answer your question: [https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) Bottom line is that being able to FIRE is about saving more than you spend, enough that eventually, your savings can cover your spending. This is, of course, easiest when you make way more money than you would even want to spend....like I'm happy spending $30k/year for both of us; if I had a job making $500k/year, I'd have no clue what to spend it on, so I'd instantly be saving more in a year than I have in my lifetime to date! So, you see lots of high-salary people doing FIRE.

But, you can do FIRE with a low salary, too, you just have to be able to live with an even lower standard of living. For example, if you can earn $40k post-tax, and live on $30k like I do, then you'd be able to save 25% of your pay every year. Checking the simple math in that article I linked, you'd be able to retire after 32 years when saving 25%, so you'd be able to retire around age 55 if you start around age 22/23. Still early! Hopefully $40k isn't your permanent salary, though; let's say you start at $40k, but work hard, and get promoted, and are at $60k after 5 years. At $60k, if you can save 50%, you're on track for just 17 years, which would be age 40-ish. And so on; more income and/or lower expenses accelerates FIRE!

Anyone who can earn more than they spend, and save the difference, is on track to retire earlier/better than those who spend everything. So the mere fact you're thinking about this is a good sign you're ahead of average!
I did too but man it only took me about two trades to figure out that patience is needed lol. If it takes a whole year to figure out stock market basics then stock market may not be for that person
no one is reading the article.  it says they will announce new membership types later.  This might be good for holders later since they might limit crowds in this way

Anybody got etrade? 

Do options in etrade automatically try to sell on Friday 3pm like robinhood?
how is that percentage calculated? What did you pay for the call and what's the target? 
can you explain to me: options are shares make the same amount of money or not? 

let's say the stock is $10, and you have $20 call. 

* you buy 100 shares for $10 (-$1k) and sell for $20 (+$2k) you made $1k profit

* you buy a $20 call for $X (idk how much, but i assume not much, say -$100). Then you exercise the call to get 100 shares, you pay -$900 ( $10*100 - what you already paid, correct?) and sell for +$2k). It's the same $1k profit right? 

So the percentage you listed is the difference between call cost ($100) and net profit ($1000)?? So in this example it's 900%?

You can always open both accounts and trade real 0.01 lots on both at the same time and compare which one made more money at the end of the month. I mean, you take so many trades that even 1 week should be enough to make a decision.

For people who trade manually, they need an MT4 multi terminal or a trade copier like the one that Fxblue has for free.

Meme stocks for a small chunks, but you define your risk tolerance. If you sell a put make sure you would have enough to buy 200 shares minimum in case it goes against you to average down. But everything from aapl to pltr to gme to rkt to amd to all these ev's to whatever you're bullish on

1:  If you're thinking of selling GME, twist your own dick till it bleeds.  It will help you stop thinking about that.  That rocketship isn't even close to out of fuel yet.

&#x200B;

2:  September 15c's from BB.  Just shut up and do it, retard, and you might graduate to autist.

&#x200B;

3:  If you're in PLTR, just come to grips with the fact that you've been friend zoned and she doesn't love you.  Hasn't since Thanksgiving.  You're falling into the same trap that every other cuck did with MU for years.  Just stop.

&#x200B;

4:  If you want to act like a real pro for a moment and look smart, the 1/22 95c for AMD is a fucking outstanding value.  With the way semis have moved up today but how AMD didn't follow, it should be absolutely no fucking problem whatsoever to retrace back to that level in a short week.

What do you think about the potential risk of the full blue gov potentially cutting military spending?
1- yes it's not cluttered now so that's great.  I'd say consider Ameritrades tos, IB's tws, Schwab's SSE as you think about clutter.  All 3 do a pretty good job of offering tons of customizable options (no pun intended) without feeling too cluttered. 

2- nice!

3-  good to know! 

4-  yeah multiple expirations can be common amongst more experienced traders 

5-  I think I see what you're saying, but still not completely following you here.  I can think of 3 ideas for this, one of which you mentioned; 1-  when option one (or strategy one) expires, you simply remove it from the board, and everything from that date forward only reflects any open contracts, or, 2- when option one (or strategy one) expires, you just leave it in there so it's reflective of all strategies, or, 3- your idea of hovering over the date/price so as to see the difference (profit/loss with all strategies, or just current/open strategy).  I think option 3 would be great.  Would allow you to see everything at once, very powerful.  I was actually trying to do this earlier with one of my trades, as it has multiple legs and expirations.  I currently use a hand calculator to figure out what P&L looks like lol.

6-  I think you nailed it with the double slider idea.  It's perfect.  Wouldn't clutter and super easy & intuitive to use.  The other site is annoying cause you have to manually type in the range and the range changes on you to strange numbers when you make adjustments to the strategy.

When is the WSB gang going to start squeezing PLTR? Fucking Citi bank goofed hard and is driving old money into a short position! Its time for the retards to squeeze these like their moms squeeze black dongs when their dads at work! PLTR üöÄ TEAM.... ASSEMBLE!!!
And all the stocks fuck you in the end
What are they gonna do, short it more? üòÇü§£
Yeah, you know they need something for the base but the rest looks good (other than the fine print of course) so this is good to go.

hope you understand how rockets work... they are all meant to explode, controllably lol
Tons of GME bears they just got downloaded to oblivion
I think MT is a hold for now. Not gonna lie though, I wen't in early and most of my positions are red, slowly climbing back into green. Bought a 10x 6/18 $35 strike during a dips, and it's the only green one so far (%21 total gain). Like WSB 'tards have been suggesting, long dated calls are your friend.
That's not shares short thats the float size you tard
he has 7 million fucking dollars and Cramer references him on national TV. he ain‚Äôt spending time making memes of himself dude
wat
After 8 months of trial and error, and hundreds of hours of YouTube, I realised; through research and patience, you can ride the low high, and repeat the process.
I bought gme today and you can too.
#I see the number of members increasing. New AUTISTS you must buy GME as an entry fee. Don‚Äôt like it? Fuck you leave.

Robinhood gave everyone 0DTE options in preparation for the GME squeeze.

no

It's what happens if they have to compete. I get the same from my health insurance and ISP...same goes for my electricity supplier.

I really wish I would‚Äôve caught on to all the artificial pumping before going in. Oh well, live and learn
So, if you were Melvin, and you wanted to bust our asses, what would be the most effective way to do it? I'm thinking it would be to kill the price after hours, or over the weekend. Could they pull it off? And if so, how would you defend against that? Any other ideas of how they could do damage?
I appreciate it
Does anyone remember that jelqing guy that was on here once?
You're still the retard. But congrats on the gains
now DFV is giving daily updates? almost like he's getting more people to buy, while shorts and institutions are holding, speculators are selling amongst themselves the few available floating shares to drive the price higher   üòí
Plenty. It's Gigachad time
Considering it a bond has been suggested before, though I'm not sure how that actually works.  Some also suggest to count the estimated payout as fixed income that reduces your overall FI number.
Proud of you.
Thanks
Fk. I need to reinstall now.
I mean, throw a dart at a board with symbols on it and you‚Äôd probably have turned a profit in the last year. I don‚Äôt know that I believe 350%, but I do know that don‚Äôt not believe it‚Äôs possible.
Remember the WSB way for all the new guys incoming. What‚Äôs FD mean? What‚Äôs a put? What‚Äôs IV? ‚ÄúNOBODY TELL HIM!‚Äù
i think its a slow double squeeze, short squeeze + gamma squeeze with a hint of genuine investment in a turn around situation. Based on metrics alone gamestop could make a comeback no squeeze required, but im not too invested in that story because that story would take months and years to play out.
Also remember, there's almost 2 million people here. When everybody goes on the same stock, the stock might move just because of the sheer volume of that.
I got in between .001 and .002 back in the summer, $20k in realized profits (pre-tax), and $45k unrealized. I‚Äôm strapped in for the rest of this ride.
I‚Äôll buy bb but I‚Äôll hold, thanks
The influx of retards makes me more confident about my calls
I've made 40k over the last 1M and the government is going to send me another 2k for doing nothing.

Thanks Buyden!
Not to mention the whole industry is moving to ARM. Apple showed the whole industry ARM isn't just a mobile chip. We may see ARM chips in the data center with Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia. I'm really hoping AMD has a plan for this. It was my first stock and I don't want to see it go the way of Intel.
That actually makes sense.
Thank you.
I‚Äôll throw 100 on some FD‚Äôs

Fuck yeah man congrats
This is the way.
What makes you say this besides your own retarded intuition?
Literally just got my income tax from NYS that I applied for in April. $4.20 lol, New York fucking me all up with their taxes
won't this squeeze have to happen sooner than later (e.g. \~1 week?)

wouldn't it be better to just get like 50 shares at open (\~$40) and then the YOLO 1/22 calls?
Lol my bad - I should‚Äôve said all that - so 
23 - -17,000 in loans/CC bills - I make about $20,000 a year - and I have absolutely no money rn in any account. 
I want to take minimal risk if investing money and obviously pay off my bills. Other than that idk how to maximize it
Why not, let‚Äôs pump this shit up

Fortunately those who are already on reddit already know about WSB, and also those who watch Cramer that are *not* on reddit are likely boomers who have no idea how to navigate the interwebs.

Right now if we take a look at the S&P 500 the % are something like -

AAPL - 6.42%
MSFT - 5.07%
...etc.

So my question is, if I invest $100 in the SPY, is it equivalent to investing $6.42 in AAPL, $5.07 in MSFT, and so on

For reals. I'm tired of having to walk people through options except for a few close friends.

If I see anyone asking if their FD's are going to print while at the same time asking what an FD is, I'm going to tell them it's a Free Delivery of money.

Fuck em. I am not a financial advisor so you aren't going to get financial advice.
$30C 21Jan-2022 too optimistic?
2 @ 17$. I almost bought the .02cent calls that morning. But overall Portfolio up 41% since dec 24.
I still have $40 and $50 (got rid of all my $25 and $30 that i had before this week and i  had averaged the fuck down quickly on Wed morning when they were like .20 cents and made $$$). If the rest of my calls are underwater tomorrow morning depending on what is going on with GME premarket I am going to average down again at some point, (if i see volume coming in).
No idiot
IWM to $150 tomorrow

It 100% isn't normal. Challenge now is to keep your ego in check. We now have thousands of stock gurus that have been trading for 6 months and have a sub $5k account, yet they want to go on YouTube and reddit and preach about how smart they are and how they can't lose money. Happens every bull market over all asset classes. We are not smart, we are not special, everything is going up and everything is hyped. A legit moron can make a killing in this market, and they are. Myself included of course.

Time to say Ali Byebye
I‚Äôve been reading into this to try and find an answer and I think I‚Äôve figured it out. The US treasury, which is basically the governments own savings of USD, is adding 2 trillion more into circulation. Because there is now 2 trillion less in money reserves for loans etc, the interest rates increase to encourage more people to hold money in the US treasury. The reason for the spike today must have been people taking this opportunity. In particular this would have affected AUD too as the interest return from USD became more favourable, so a lot of long term ‚Äòsafe‚Äô investors took their money out of gold and put it into USD. Because gold makes up a large part of AUD‚Äôs exports, this would have caused AUD to go down.
That was last night's news. It's why SPCE  mooned today.

Where do you see that?
So I've set budgets for ten years for schools districts - if they get a little extra it all gets eaten up and or hidden in our reserves for the day when budgets are cut again. 

Or when people stop paying their property taxes like 6% of people did this year. 

Look make a meme and people will bid the stocks but it won't translate into any meaningful new business. 

In the last round of stimulus in 08-09 for schools we got $2.4 mil. We bought 18 wifi hotspots that were outdated 15 mths later.
Lol why, it‚Äôs prolly hitting 220 tomorrow
How do you guys go about taking breaks?

I'm up 250% From last years initial investment so I thought I'de just take some time off and hold some shares and just chill out and not watch the market for 2 weeks or so.

AAPL is the best place to be right now if you want safety and resiliency with long term growth. They are going to have a massive quarter, rumors point to increased orders with their manufacturing partners. They have hundreds of billions in the bank and are buying back shares and have incredible resiliency during COVID. AR/VR in the next year or two, Apple Car around 2025-2028, I feel AAPL is a company you want to hold long term. I‚Äòve been long shares for years and I like shares vs calls to collect a dividend and have a DRIP. I‚Äôll also sell some puts like the Feb 19 120P to collect some extra income Theta Gang style at a price I‚Äôm happy to buy at or wheel from there. You can make some cash with your AAPL 2/19 $130.00 call if it pops after earnings, if you are open to a longer term hold consider long OTM calls in further out months like April or June so there is less Theta decay working against you.

More tendies for GME and PLTR
Black Berry just sold 90% of their technology to Huawei. Friend of mine that heads up the engineering department just confirmed it and is most likely losing his job.
Nah I like the original but I will help you find them I‚Äôd dump
Certified madman confirmed.

I salute you.
Just realized turtle won't be the leader when senate impeachment trial happens. He'll be able to nod his head and tisk tisk and get out free and clear. Starting to hate that turtle
Besides potentially realizing it as income instead of LTCG, it's not like you don't profit hugely if you get exercised at 13 tomorrow.
Let's say he received those million shares at $5 each. Now if the CEO had bought 5,000,000 in gme options, they would be worth 33,000,000,000
Anyone else in $MARA? I know the c o i n s aren't allowed to be discussed here, but what about stonks related to them? There's a pretty consistent floor to the stock imo and 19-21 debit spreads are looking pretty good
I too foresee Amazon adding a trillion dollars to its market cap by EOM.
Yes, trading starts, but at 9am the morning bell rings. The app turns white, 9:31 option movements post
Sorry I just assumed you were talking about GME
‚ÄúThe fact that it‚Äôs so richly valued and still has money to pay a dividend tells me that they have a ton of profits‚Äù

I don‚Äôt follow your logic at all. Their phuckton of profits is represented by their PE of 88. They have yield of 0.12%. Their dividend hasn‚Äôt grown since 2018. And I don‚Äôt get how you equate their rich valuation with their level of profits. I just don‚Äôt follow. 

We can all agree to disagree here. NVidia has done tremendously and their investors have been richly rewarded. But I don‚Äôt their pop onto many dividend investors radar, nor should they, necessarily. 

Yes, investing in growth stocks to generate capital to invest in dividend payers is a good strategy (IMO), but when it‚Äôs time to turn on the dividend spigot, NVidia isn‚Äôt going to be a name many people turn to. 

Yes, investors have done amazing with it
Fucked up making fun of this dude but I‚Äôm on the same ride baby let‚Äôs have a safe trip
Your break even is just the strike price + premium price. I could be wrong but I think it's something to do with the risk/reward relationship of strike.

If part time becomes less stigmatized, dropping from 32 hours to 24 hours per week would be ‚Äúfun‚Äù in the sense that it‚Äôs still enough to cover expenses and it comes with 4-day weekends which is enough to support any hobby I might want to pursue. 

Else starting a microgrowery in a legal state is my current post-FIRE frontrunner. Learning a new industry and skills, finding clients, and making a little cash on the side sounds fun.

Makes perfect sense then the IOU is at the bottomed price when they buy more to fulfil the IOU... how does that happen if it‚Äôs all done digitally.

I mean I‚Äôd imagine people selling shares would be looking at a computer with the amount of shares available to sell and the price, like we do? Does that mean it‚Äôs clearly done on purpose. 

Surely this could go tits up if they made the mistake of selling after some major announcement they were not aware of.

Damn, Graham and Kevin used to be so good when they were talking solely about real estate. 

They got me into it and I own two properties that are going to be the home to a duplex and a cabin in the next year. Thing is I started watching those dudes loooong before they blew up. Now all the vids I liked most are behind the course paywalls. 

Just talk with an actual real estate investor. They'll give you great advice. You don't get rich quickly with real estate unless you started buying the bottom of the market in 2013 in California, Chicago, or NYC lol

I meant at open today as in Thursday. I did this and didn‚Äôt break even until the after noon or something lol. But if you buy and hold shares they can be used for shorts which means the shorters have to keep buying shares to cover their positions. Driving the price up. Way up.
They just gained $300 million today.  They can last out a few more months.  Realistically you only have until now people support ending lockdowns than enforcing them. Thats going to be within the next 2 months.
Huh, it was up over 13% today. Sooo what is the impact of this?
I guess it is trading with Tesla, and Tesla is getting dragged down by FANG.

what i dont get is.. if you just went long literally anything you'd made like 30%+ just with ETFs... or if you yolo'd into tech up like 200-500%
Imagine taking 8 months, during THESE past 8 months, when every single stock has gone up $100
Most of the times, EVERY TIME I jump on a rocket ship it crash a few hours later. PLUG 71$ was the latest offender.

Its the attitude of this sub specifically. Too many weak links here who's words will end up in an investigation into market manipulation.

If you're looking at ETF's I personally recommend ICLN. It's a clean energy ETF which I believe will outperform TAN (also a clean energy ETF) over the next few months. A Democrat government will likely raise clean energy prices, so in my relatively inexperienced opinion, ICLN is the way to go.
Dang NKLA, that's quite the bounce if I say so myself.
Lmao at the first comment. "How much money you plan on losing this time"
So you‚Äôre warning people to be careful because the same thing might happen tomorrow as what happened today, about the stock that went up 25% today?
What‚Äôs the deal with BB? New meme stock? Thinking about getting into some Leaps
Buying puts on Tan tomorrow. RSI is over 90 on the fucking MONTHLY chart, everyone expecting this biden announcement to send clean energy to the moon and don't realize these stocks already at Mars and need to consolidate. Also shorting tesla tomorrow.
He jelqed himself right outta here
NEVER SELL, Stonks only go up!
Thank you!
26% of float
I'm not sure you know what premise means.  

Also you derive a companies value by taking the number of shares and dividing it by the revenue of the previous year. Game stop trades far under its revenue, which means if you did the math you'd get 90 per share. That's not even counting the squeeze.
Really appreciate you taking the time to write that out. 

Seeing if I actually understand this-

If you sell the call to me for $300 and then the price stays flat and premiums drop down (iv crush) then you can buy back the option at $100 , make your profit and not worry about it being exercised? Kinda using the crush to your advantage?
yeah im probably in for POSH..

Well I'm day trading so I am going to possibly sell it minutes later if it goes against me.  Closer expiration are more liquid and less risk premium u have to pay. It also moves more with the stock.
I was hoping today was gonna be flat to get some more. Gamestop shares are like mint first edition Charizards and everyone wants them.

I just want to take a moment and reflect on the fact that this GME play will go down in WSB history.

What is the source on this $40B number being echoed?
I wonder if that one guy was about it and drank his own piss
Transocean is up 356% since october. 

Schlumberger is a major service company, its not up that high but has had a nice recovery and dividends.

Gonna try not to be political but alas oil is politics.

Everybody says oh Biden is pro electric blah blah blah.

How much money was his boy making as a consultant to a Ukrainian oil company? Just to provide a "contact".

Not to mention we had a conflict with russia when they moved on the region but i am sure its coincident. 

If hillary won, the thought was that we would be in another war, now her comrade is back in office.

Biden will probably go back to pro china globalist economic policies, which will help drive thier economy which is becoming a major importer of oil. 

Obama is the guy who made it legal for the U.S. to export oil to other nations.

Covid wont last forever.

I dont care how you feel about these people or thier promises, all politicians are after money and power.

Oil is still tied to the american dollar.

The fed is printing money for economic stimulis.

If the dollar inflates the the price of oil goes up.

Also, when the economy is down it seems that oil goes up. I dont know why.

I am super duper bullish on oil.

Transocean, schlumberger, diamondback energy, apache, murphy, mi swaco, Halliburton. Etc.

I am gonna try to figure out who makes valves and maybe invest in them. 

I may be wrong and the run up that we have seen is it but i think there is more room to grow, especially if the powers that be are heavily invested in it. 

For example, diamondback energy was once valued at 120 a share at the peak crazy oil field and its in the 50s right now.

You mean it dipped after the new year 5% a day for a few days? Did it recover slightly and then plunge again? I'm definitely on my toes right now and have some extra cash in hand in case I ought to buy the dip but then again, it may only be the beginning. Idk I guess I'm just riding the train till I get spooked and hopefully it's not too late by then.
So I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to go all in on BB tomorrow.
I went yolo on PLTR.

There's a very real possibility that stock ends the month in the 65 territory, and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it ends Q1 at 85.

yes, it will probably sell off down to 35 in the first 30 mins of trading. the point is, to hold the line or buy more at that point
I still don‚Äôt have them. Do you have to have gold or something?
I have some rental property. I treat my tenants as I would want to be treated and have had really smooth relationships thus far. Management companies cut into bottom line, use their shoddy labor, and generally do not add value.

I keep trying to figure out how much it will go up, but the only number I can come up with is a dollar sign
BUY GME 50+

If you are in the field, I am sure you will recognize their products. Apligraf was an OG tissue engineering proof of concept.

Every online marketplace does it and Poshmark is already well known.
Lol. They're buying empty buildings.
How can your portfolio go up with the sheer amount of weight on your balls that should be dragging it down
No, everyone knows the higher the share price means it's overvalued. AMZN is one of the most overvalued companies on the market! They're barely profitable and a $3.1k share price! Don't even get me started on BRK.A! The best stocks are the ones closest to $0.01. /s

Because the shorts will have to cover for their positions by tomorrow and buy shares in the open market.
This is what happens when Melvin shorts things.
A 3 day weekend will be excruciating for myself and fellow GME holders.
For me I just forget about it. You‚Äôll never ride ever rocket, so just enjoy your gains and your time off. There‚Äôll always be more

People are downvoting you because they don't like what you have to say, but you are at least partially right. Laziness might not be the only or biggest reason, but it is a reason I have seen a lot with my own eyes. 

There are dudes I know collecting unemployment, disability, and stimulus checks and then spending it on OnlyFans ho's or trying to buy attention from women with it. Why the hell should my tax dollars go to some simp's masturbation aids? Fuck those guys. We're going to end up with an economy where handouts are given to simps, who then give it to sex workers, both of whose numbers grow because people see it as easy money, and then a continually shrinking population of people who have to work harder but get taxed more to fund that shit. THAT is /r/aboringdystopia.

2021 is all stocks from 1999
Don‚Äôt say that
Because that‚Äôs how a squeeze works. As long as no one paper hands it
Let me guess. PFE and NVAX
While I don‚Äôt agree with the yolo approach I do commend you on the strategy and it paying off. Congrats, that‚Äôs a huge win!!
Anyone knows when melvins puts actually expire ?
It definitely is too late
God i love this shit. Congrats retard.
GME to 420.69
just bought 1k shares
Sold this to fund SENS. Dont regret it at all.

Did you have a stroke while you typed this?
Go ITM and exercise the options when the squeeze happens for a sick profit.
What if they just decide to let the puts expire instead of buying shares?
Hold.  I had 5 snap 1/15 $50 puts that I sold yesterday and would have made bank on if I just held
spy to 400 inauguration day. will be a 37 bagger.
Amen.
Are we gonna moon at 7:15 when Biden starts talking?
Doesn‚Äôt seem thaaaat bullish to me but I sure hope you‚Äôre right cause I dumped 25% of my portfolio into clean energy before close today on the hopes he‚Äôd pump it! Fingers crossed brrrooo

Robinhood just went nuclear before a Friday
Ford is going to have to spend billions over the next couple years to switch over to more EVs.  After that, I think it's a solid company and brand.

You could buy and hold now while the price is low, but i dont expect any big moves in the near term.  Just my opinion.
Fuck man I thought you were all systematically hunted and destroyed
I‚Äôm not sure about popping anymore. Too many s&p matchers moved in. So no more big volatility. No more big losses or gains. At least that‚Äôs my thought.
They have no right to shut us down, we've done nothing. Stocktwits does the same thing all the time and there's no problem, so why would we be in trouble? Ah yes, our ideas work and we are organized, threatening the big bois' control over the public. That's a pretty good reason to shut us down indeed.
His predictions yesterday include 45 GME today, 60 EOW, and then "Shit. I think I'm getting hard for GME puts."

He bases his projection on his sell limits.
Gonna paraphrase but something along the lines of ‚Äúold fucks, those young fucks on Wall Street bets on Reddit know how to make money.  Give them a search. I‚Äôm on there so just google it.  They‚Äôre killing short sellers.‚Äù

^^^ buy the dip in fcel and plug
Yeah, I didn't like them at first, but they grew on me.  I think the noise issue is more so because the car has no engine noise.  They seem to handle well.  I love the acceleration of the performance model 3, but they chew up tires pretty fast.  I had couple of 3 series, acura, lexus, and by far the model 3 has been my favorite.  I do love the bmw m3 and m4s.
Selling my tesla calls at open.
Yo you got a source for that? I went to my doctor two years ago about that because id go soft with my gf. Doc told me i was just too stressed and my levels were fine but tbh i doubt that was true and he wouldnt tell me my fucking level.
Gotta buy shares to unlock answer.
Yeah I‚Äôm interested to find out as well. I have some Fitbit too.

With the fuel Cathie added...$SPCE is in a pretty good spot for a squeeze.  Especially if they come out with a test flight date soon.
thats lame
So it's going to go up?
I had a similar experience with MARA I got in at $5 in august and it tanked until November hover in the $2-$4 range. Once is peaked over $5 again I set a stop loss which open low due to BTC and sold majority of my shares. Every time I see the price now I cringe a little but honestly okay with it cause I just remember being down 50% while the rest of the market sky rocketed

My bad, I meant let‚Äôs short squeeze it! Fuck Citi bank.
I love you bro. Thanks for keeping me off the streets
I have zero DD. I saw that chart go up 20% today. That tells me it will run again tomorrow. I am in a short term play so I can't comment on mid-March.

I found a weird way to make tendies. I continuously bet on -1000 sports games. Gains are small, but the 10% compounding is adding up.
Rough numbers are $680M EBITDA on $840M Revenue (thats CAD) on LTM, so that should be pretty much all be GEO. Granted there will be some decline here as folks transition to LEO but they still have a lot of runway on existing GEO hardware

https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-price-turns-higher-again-after-record-china-imports/ thank you vale
The wheel. Keep enough to average down if put sell goes against you. Diversify into enough companies so you're never bagholding your entire portfolio unless market completely crashes. Wait for the right opportunities to sell options, positions don't always have to be open. Be wary with meme stocks, only small positions. Keep up with research for new stocks. Don't begrudge when a call gets assigned you still made money.
MJ anyone?
thank you!
You should be making a few $ tomorrow.
I scrolled and saw Matchbox 20 and I immediately left the thread
daddy pls buy me
Long term this stock is going to rocket, and rocket organically. This has been held down for years, and in those years BlackBerry has successfully restructured itself to be a leader in the sector they're aiming for. They have a superior product in my opinion to their competitors (endpoint security, ev software (in the works), IoT) and this is going to be a catalyst for their hyper growth. I personally think this is easily a $20 stock this year, but that could go higher or maybe a tad lower, but it is severely underpriced for what they have. Their market cap should be at least 3x what it is now imo.
Going down, their latest offering closes tmr. I got puts at the peak today and will exit after shares dump tmr.
Im buying bb tomorrow but definitely not selling my lucid shares. I think theyll take off
Got a bunch of $10 calls for tomorrow... y‚Äôall think they will fill at the closing prices tomo morning?
Yeah u can't trade options in after hours, also the price won't adjust till market opens either. It's likely that call is triple the price now
True but the physical market is STILL shrinking overall, hence their revenues will never grow to what they once were unless they significantly expand their digital and online capabilities. Bricks and mortar can be a strength, but the fact that so many locations are unprofitable proves it's unlikely to be a major source of growth in the future either.
Shorts still haven‚Äôt covered. Squeeze will continue into next week
Gme
Can you show me data that says the short is propping it up?
Sell at open.
Just read through the stimulus proposal and wow - if Biden can get through a quarter of that stuff it will be monumental. Seems like healthcare, retail spending, and IT/tech might be the big movers based on what I'm reading.
I understand. But on the other hand I am thinking IF the financial system would crash down, money is worth shit. We will have other worries at that point. So the government won‚Äôt let the thing crash down. And if you do fear that scenario, then why invest ? Money will end up being worth nothing so... 

But I agree, rates must come up at some point. I think hyperinflation will be the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù, but will hammer the weak and poor, and the gap will become larger. But yea this is just some reasoning that can change every day right üòâ

Nah, we're walter white and he's Declan. OUR GAINS CANNOT BE IGNORED.
I mean the video didn't really show much- just said they will continue to focus on censorship and use the Q Anon model (that they apparently have used to censor Q Anon accounts) in the future.  Nothing that we don't already no, and probably wasn't worth some person at Twitter risking their job to record.

I'd be more worried about the new user volumes on some of the alternative social sites like Signal.  That's more a sign people are leaving the platform and revenue opportunities shrink.  No one with a majority in our government cares about Twitter censoring some conservative accounts- it serves the current admin's purpose.
Me too. My first option was a way OTM Spy put that printed. Hooked right away.
This is the way.

How I feel about FCEL.
As a complete fucking joke earlier, I bought a bunch of 1/15 10c's of BB for .08 today at about 10:30 MST.    


It jumped up 300% in like 5 fucking minutes.  So I went digging.  The September 15c, given BB's trajectory and a little DD (coupled with my knowledge of how far out a company hitching its wagon to the automotive market takes to realize gains), was the absolute sweet spot.    


Granted, that was when the stock was at 8.50.  It looks like it's at like 11 AH right now, so it will shift tomorrow, but that's still going to be a rock solid exit date.
What were premiums on those?? Couldn‚Äôt have been much over 10 cents lol. Enjoy the tendies

You can sell the call that you purchased or you can exercise it. It‚Äôs easier to just sell them as a noob. Exercising means you buy 100 stocks at that strike price.
I don‚Äôt have calls anymore but I see a lot of PLTR in this doc

Who the hell said anything about shutting us down?
I bought 166 more shares today. It‚Äôs a hold.
Bought 100 today. Ready for it.
yeah im kinda restarted sorry
I‚Äôve been spreading this post as much as possible. A lot of people don‚Äôt comprehend what we have here. This is history.
oh oh  guys we're in trouble. Cramer is really pissed at us. And instead of just saying Reddit he finally said Wall Street Bets. He said we're causing the short squeeze. Like what about the assholes shorting the stock? Shorting more shares than exist? No it's us the buyers were causing the short squeeze. 

We're manipulating the market. What planet does this MFer live on?

He also said we're causing the short squeeze on bed bath & beyond. I think we're going to have to go see the principal tomorrow you guys.
Better make your money now ha
Glad you liked it! I am probably not going to make any more posts on this, unless we make any significant changes to the sheet, such as new data/features or somehow a more simplistic display, but to me and my friend, as ‚Äúnumbers and data lovers‚Äù, this sheet is just fine with nothing spared. If you have any suggestions we would love to hear them.

And for the record, just bookmark/save our sheet, and you can continuously use it. I try to update it almost daily with the new trades coming in from the ARK fund/Cathie Woods. :)
I‚Äôm not stopping until I buy my mom a house or myself a new truck, still can‚Äôt decide
So do you come to the reddit / check the stocks daily when you take some time off? Or do you just go the route of don't look, don't think about it? I'm probably screwing myself over because I'm still checking the market once a day and checking the reddit cause it's pretty funny here lol.
I want to see a Lambo. Someone asked him about it on his stream last night.

Sold GIKcall too early and missed out on a bunch of profit, is it still a good time to get in before merger? If so what position since 15c 1-15 is already itm now

Me.  For the last two months.   Gotta get used to the volatility .... but i take the profits and go back in.   Its a pretty easy pattern and just match it up with coynes value

One correction, they did replace the guy who left, it's just that his responsibilities are split between me and the new guy. But yeah there's only so much you can do within the context of large corporations so I'll take the short term gain. My boss said the standard "promotion" raise is 6%. Internal moves come with a lot of limitations. 

I've been with the company my entire career (13.5 years). I'm not opposed to leaving if I find something significantly better but I do enjoy my current work, make a good salary (will be around $150k this year in a LCOL area), enjoy the people, have a lot of autonomy, and currently am WFH which I hope can continue after Covid.

It's all a balance.
I hope for a dip but it's retarted when it's gonna be over 69 within months

Ok real talk. The stock has increased exponentially at this point. Should I wait for a dip to buy back in or buy in now as there is a potential for continued surge? I‚Äôm speculating that the stock will settle next week and would be a better time for me to buy back in.

How much Lucid do you have?
As a GME seller a 15$ can someone tell WTF HAPPENED. 

HOW IS IT AT 42$!!!
why not both?
Mostly I just look at the 30 day charts. If it is moving upwards and has increasing volume I‚Äôm inclined to partake. I also check the number of float shares and try to avoid any stock that has more than a couple HUNDRED MILLION SHARES out there... 100 million outstanding shares is OK, 2  billion is NOT. 
Also, if I like a stock that I own but want to take a profit because it went UP, I‚Äôll usually sell about half the shares and let the rest ride out.

Im in at .17, only 500 shares tho. Not sure if i should sell and rebuy on a dip later on or just keep what i have
Big batch tomorrow, more in April and June/July if I recall.
Did deepvalue sell?
Could I trouble you some more? 

let's say the stock is $10, and you have $20 call.

* you buy 100 shares for $10 (-$1k) and sell for $20 (+$2k) you made $1k profit

* you buy a $20 call for $X (idk how much, but i assume not much, say -$100). Then you exercise the call to get 100 shares, you pay -$900 ( $10*100 - what you already paid, correct?) and sell for +$2k). It's the same $1k profit right?

But the benefit of using options is that you don't have to pay upfront, and if it doesn't work out, say stock drops -50% you're only out the initial price of $100 vs $500? 


Sorry if this is very basic noob knowledge
Oh no! We'll just have to start another WSB2 like blackmarket2 and that will keep the fucking plebs out with their bullshit 800$ loss. Shit is annoying as fuck. I'm trying to get rich not read posts about someone crying about pennies. I have to skip past 10 posts til I get to some meat.

Yeah.  I assume there's typically more supply than demand.  And they don't even offer a lot of them.  Have a bunch available right now is rather unusual.

FB actually dropped from it's IPO price of $38 down to around $17 in the first 4 months of trading, but then started going up and never looked back.  I was a fool to not get my 1,000 shares at $17.

I worked at a library part-time throughout high school and college (not a real librarian). 

Even for a small town, they could always find applicants with a degree in library science, but they had trouble finding people who were also comfortable with technology (you have to make decisions about cataloguing software, pick audiobook services to subscribe to, help patrons access the internet, that sort of thing). They also needed someone who was patient and friendly with the public regardless of age or ability...and not too uppity for manual work like shelving, making signs, or occasionally unclogging a toilet.

Just knowing a lot about books and reading book reviews doesn't cut it. That's the "fun part" that everyone wants to do lol.
More people need to be made aware of this. Going to be a lot of people shocked about taxes this year.

Here's how I'm playing this GME squeeze:

I've been slowly selling some of my 5k shares at peaks and replacing them with OTM options. This limits my downside risk but allows me to stay in the game if the stock keeps mooning. When those short term options go into the money, I sell them at a peak and buy further OTM options for next week to capture profits.

Contrary to popular opinion around here, the options are good for the squeeze because the MMs will have to buy shares and keep buying shares to delta balance as the price goes up.

It's taxed as a penalty every year until it's corrected. You can also correct it by under contributing in future years (but have to consider gains on the excess as well).
If you correct it by the file deadline there's no penalty or additional tax documentation. Having gone through the same thing last year, I'd suggest correcting it immediately. It can take a month or so to actually correct, so don't put it off too long.

Prior to a squeeze MTM losses alone aren‚Äôt likely to be the only factor if borrows are liquid and cheap. If it‚Äôs cheap to borrow then it‚Äôs more likely that the position will stay open until risk gets out of hand by which time it‚Äôs already a squeeze.
Do they have any upcoming catalysts?

This guy‚Äôs a clown. He thinks ‚Äúgoogling what stocks are good‚Äù is good enough. And just because he made money doesn‚Äôt mean he could replicate the results. In fact...if that‚Äôs the process I‚Äôd be surprised if he didn‚Äôt lose money long term. He certainly won‚Äôt over-perform.

Im a bit confused about how ETFs work. Hoping someone can clear this up for me:

Right now if we take a look at the [S&P 500 the %](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/constituents) are something like -

AAPL - 6.42%,
MSFT - 5.07%,
AMZN - 4.15%
...etc.

So my question is, if I invest $100 in the SPY, is it equivalent to investing $6.42 in AAPL, $5.07 in MSFT, $4.15 in AMZN, and so on
In this case it is more sophisticated - there is actual DD compared to TNXP - but far too many young accounts hyping not to raise a red flag.

Tattooed chef thoughts?
Someone once told me I have to use my own judgement in order to develop good judgement. If you're being spoon-fed "safe" stocks how will you ever develop discernment? I'm not bitter about my losses at all - in fact I openly joke about them. You can't stop someone from learning a lesson, you're only prolonging the inevitable so you might as well take off the training wheels from the beginning at the risk of making them lazy. For example...

I spent half a day WHILE AT WORK looking up different brokerage apps yet you see people lazily walk in every day re-asking the same question without even bothering to search. Does my Google work better than everyone else or am I willing to at least try before I ask for help? There's a difference between "What's your experience with Program\_X?" and "Just tell me what to get.." Person A started looking but needed help with the final decision, and Person B just wants everyone to do the work for them.

Better example... "Where's a good place to discover stocks early?" vs "Which stocks do you think will take off next?" Person A wants to learn to work themselves and Person B wants to be spoon-fed money. Coincidently Person B is usually the person asking 'What price should I buy in?" only to ask later "What should be my selling point?" Person B basically wants to make money while putting forth minimal effort while everyone else spends dozens of hours TRYING to learn.

TLDR.... The lower the barrier for entry, the lower people's expectations of work are. Spoon-feed people information and they'll always be back for a second helping. This isn't a gaming community this is the stock market - everyone is expected to work.

Other highly shorted stocks I've been looking at

1. MAXR - 10.74 % of the float shorted.
2. SPCE - 31% of the float shorted.
3. MSTR 17.6% of the float shorted.

All three had a nice run today. Any autists know of some other highly shorted stocks at risk for a squeeze?
Is this when you take a break ? So just sit money on the spac since it won't ever go below $10 anyway and just see if it pops while you chill? That's actually a pretty good idea lol.

I‚Äôm a big believer that the only person who knows the direction of the market is the one pushing it that way. 

My biggest losses all came from picking an exit point and ‚Äúbelieving‚Äù it had to hit it. 

It‚Äôs incredibly hard to choose an exit point. The only way I‚Äôve been able to do it is through reading loss of momentum in order flow. More often then not, I still leave a load on the table. Today I took 6 ticks on a 10 tick trade twice. 

It‚Äôs true I cut my winnings most of the time, but I also scratch more often then I lose and that adds up to a lot of protected capital. 

Picking profit taking and loss taking exits is a losers game. Only time it applies is when the exit point disproves your theory for entry. For example, you might believe resistance is strong at your price point, so breaking through it means you were wrong.

I dont know what  other calls you made but if you looked at the technicals it was way overdue for a correction. You'll see a common trend among booming stocks that once the RSI hits 88-90 and the oscillator is peaking, a stock will flatline for a bit or dip. PLUG will definitely come back in the weeks to come but timing is key.

100% agree. There is simply no other options. What should we do? Just put our cash under a mattress? It‚Äôll just decrease exponentially over the years from inflation. I‚Äôve always believe that since the 2008 crash, the rich and poor gap really started to truly begin. I think this continues for years to come and if inflation and increases in taxes get bad enough, the rich may take their money and leave. That is my biggest worry.

What about green energy?
If we looked tomorrow and saw that short interest was drastically decreased, then that would be bad news for squeeze potential because that would mean that many already covered and we've already experienced a major squeeze.

If we look tomorrow and short interest is unchanged, that is good news for the squeeze potential because that would mean they haven't covered shit and our rocket up this week was organic buying and the squeeze hasn't even started.
Wow, GME and BB holding strong, and BBBY going absolutely vertical to join the party. Hell yeah!
Wow better growth than I'd imagined, good for them. Hope you don't mind all the probably Googlable questions but I don't know much about them and figured they've mostly been riding TSLAs coattails. Do they have dealerships? How's the value of their cars compare to a Model Y? With being so NOT vertically integrated in comparison, how can they compete? Is there demand for the product, is what I'm getting at.
I treat these shares like 1st edition Charizards. I see a price dip I'm adding more cash in hand.

Where you going to college for $7500?
Why what‚Äôs up
You can of course, but as someone who paid mostly cash, and less than you are considering, to go back to school in middle age, think hard about it. That price is high and if you don‚Äôt need it for your work, consider it very carefully. I was surprised how little I learned. I had self educated to the point that most classes were not new information and many classes were the equivalent of the instructor simply reading over the PowerPoints that the textbook publisher provided. If you are going for a PhD, hopefully that would be better, but I‚Äôm not sure a masters program would be. Check out MOOC courses and other free online learning. Ask for a syllabus from some of the classes you would take and see what the classes cover. Sit in and observe some of the classes you would take in your program and not just the ones the ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù department suggests. Visit the academic department and ask the chair for permission to contact several professors for permission to observe. 

And of course, be sure to look at you and your husband‚Äôs budget and make sure you can afford it. 

If you‚Äôre attending school at night on top of full time work, you‚Äôll be tired. I was wide awake and engaged for classes, which was great for learning, but then I would have trouble decompressing at bedtime and stay up too late, making the next morning difficult.

Im fairly new to stocks so I can only buy a few shares at a time.

I highly recommend looking at /r/Boggleheads (and the bogglehead forum too) if you haven‚Äôt already. 

Last I went down the rabbithole of researching international asset allocations, you‚Äôll more or less find sold arguments on both sides. Most boils down to splitting hairs over allocation vs world makeup, some words John Boggle mentioned in a book (regarding having no xUS), and just whether its worth the risk in general over US holdings.

Personally, I just go to the brokerage whitepapers on stuff like this. Fidelity‚Äôs is even similar to Vanguard‚Äôs. Speculatively, I see the U.S. as a waning superpower. I also would rather bet on the world rather than a particular region for long term investing.
It will be exceptionally difficult to get a high salary in a field you don't enjoy at all, because it is hard to remain employed (let alone get promoted) at a job where you have no interest in the foundational materials.

Most people who have high pay but dislike their jobs really love the underlying base challenge, but don't like other aspects of the job (work/life balance requirements; office politics; insufficient challenge; etc).  It's very rare to get and maintain those jobs while actively hating the core of the job.

I'm not in GME but it's like Jesus -- either you believe in the short squeeze or you don't. If you don't, get out now and take profits. If you do, I think the bulls believe this is just the beginning, easily going to $80-100+
Fucking Cramer turning this into a dick measuring contest. Sure we have some power,  but we don‚Äôt have trillions of dollars worth of power; which all the other hedge funds and investment moguls do. 

And now these tycoons have a point to prove because their egos and pride have been damaged.

Oof. I hope not I‚Äôm holding calls.
Possibly. Also possible the only other woman here is Cathie Wood lurking
You don't think it will go under 21 in the next week do you? I got a shit load of them spreads I mentioned
I've got 1/29 $138 hoping for some movement so I can get out
Already up 100% on my ICLN leaps after like 2 weeks (only one contract but still), going to be grabbing some more even further out every time it dips over the next year or so
Ah yes, at this rate she will be a savant degenerate like us! One of us! One of us!
1,7k I will gamble long term, because they have x in their name, Elon loves companies with x
I'm actually all in GME. I dont even care anymore
This is glorious
It most likely is if it hasn‚Äôt gone away. Had one, just a bit of shit would come out when I squeezed it, then it would go flat for a bit and then puff up again. I went through that for weeks before I finally had it cut out, two stitches and it never came back

Just waiting on someone here to see the massive rise and post a massive DD post and have it sky rocket before the weekend only to crash on Monday, I would say wait until tomorrow to sell and then buy up the dumpster fire on Monday would be a good strategy. 

There are supposed to be more extraction results in Q2 so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we see this above a dollar this year, some people would say three dollars by years end but I can‚Äôt see that happening unless A major battery producer announces they are using manganese instead of cobalt for their batteries permanently going forward. 


Considering this is the largest deposit in North America, I‚Äôd see these guys are definitely a good long game play for sure.

Not knocking GME because I'm balls deep and think it's still undervalued given the structural changes to the business model, but revenue is pretty meaningless if they aren't making money, and they aren't in spite of revenue.

That said every quarter has improved so they're losing less and less money, have a ton of cash, so the balance sheet should improve further.

Lots of reasons aside from the squeeze to be bullish on them, particularly if RC can deliver on whatever he's cooking up.
Post or ban
Yeah which is why some people can make profits on super OTM options when the stock never even gets close to the strike price but is heading in that direction

Hmm thanks mate. Maybe I should do that next time on my breaks. Sounds more stable and I can just not check on them since they aren't too volatile. I'm all in on TSLA shares during this break so i'm checking it daily to make sure it aint crashing lol.
"buttfuck that bush, I want 300 birds stat!"
Sure it's a generalization but that's the reality for people who were goaded into out of state or private universities by their parents and the government urging everyone to get a college degree.  Fortunately I went to a private, out of state school on a partial scholarship, and my family paid for the rest.

Wealth inequality is the biggest issue we face domestically (student loans making it harder for people to invest and/or save) and I empathize with people who sought out valuable degrees financed via debt.  

But you shouldn't be given a free pass for taking on debt and then asking for complete loan forgiveness.  There's no honor in that.
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre mentally stable, and you really shouldn‚Äôt be here. Mods please do everyone a favour here.

SENS wants 2 bucks tomorrow
Nah, if you're going to do short term calls you need to have üíé‚úã

The play was always going to be a multi-day squeeze. You should have only got in with an amount you were willing to see go to $0, and held through tomorrow for the potential payoff.
ARKK, ARKG, VTI.

whenever you need a break, shovel money into one (or all three) of those and delete your phone.
This isn't GME?
pretty sure its the other way. he bought long calls. he believed the option would be worth money. so he had the option to by 100 shares per contract at $20 per share. he had 1000 options contracts so he would have bought 100,000 shares for 2 million if he had exercised the option. or he could sell the options to other people to buy the shares.

I think you're thinking if he sold naked calls but didn't own the stock

Well they‚Äôre long dated so it just hurts to watch. I‚Äôm 100% not a bear, I actually played a few of the other bursts but got caught with Feb 27 strike short calls yesterday. I bought the puts to recoup the loss when it comes back down next month. (Been scalping calls throughout the day)

Even though I‚Äôm down net 6k at least this is some legendary shit so I ain‚Äôt even mad at it
Paper handz
Nice
That‚Äôs my point. Short term, it‚Äôs a quick spike for people who just went from $9-10 to 15. But every business that employs minimum wage workers, they‚Äôre not going to eat that labor cost and make less profit. So the price of the product goes up. Maybe not by 50%, since labor is only part of your overhead cost. But a significant amount nonetheless. 

Then you have to pay your skilled workers more to make it worth putting in the effort to get an above-minimum-wage skillset. 

All it does is raise the cost of living. It always catches up, and in a few years you‚Äôre right back where you started and $15/hr isn‚Äôt a living wage any more.

Wow, a wild value stock appears in this sub!  Thanks, this one wasn't on my radar.  Amazing that it's only trading a few bucks above last March lows.
Yessir I think the GME squeeze this week was triggered by a Cramer tweet that same morning, and now he‚Äôs pumping it on his show
V interesting stuff I guess this is what you learn outside of special math class
Ya i planned to jump in tmrw from a week ago because i wont have liquidity until then and ofc it moons the day before. With my luck its gonna moon to $25 and then dip to $24 so might as well buy now like the fucking retards we are

Either you will be paid a fixed price for your  shares or your shares will be converted to google stock.
They'd have to link enough reddit user names to real people, who actually invested. Doable, but challenging.
It was probably a small fraction, but then it 33xed in a year. Lmao
With all due respect, those people are fucking idiots.

The GME squeeze hasn't even HAPPENED yet, and they're going to dogshit a company that has doubled in 2 days and shows no signs of slowing down for a company that could announce a 5 billion dollar contract with the Coast Guard and still not move.   That's peak retard.
Ngl but I started with 3000 and already made 6k profit, in 1 minute. Make the correct decisions, do your DD and trust your gut.
Time to buy more GME
Dude I over-drafted my bank account to use as cheap margin for GME.

I hope I regret it
It was an all cash deal, so it should be given back to you in cash. I don't know what the exact amount per share is. The acquisition is still pending further antitrust investigations.

OI on 24p 1/15. I can‚Äôt see anymore because RH is gay, but the position requires about 5 million shares to cover.

Got mine in white üëç
I don‚Äôt see a serious dip happening until a week or more.  And by that time, you‚Äôll have missed out on more gains.  

It literally doubled.  If people were going to mass sell, we would have seen that.  But half my point is that even with mass selling, the price can‚Äôt go down, because shorts basically need to buy every single share to cover.  They are losing (in interest alone) about 3% of their initial investment every week.  That‚Äôs a terrible investment.  They need to cover

your stock seems to be mooning. congrats!  it's funny that the ticker is SNES backwards.

Aside from all the money I'll make, I'll be genuinely really impressed and happy that that retarded dinosaur of a company was able to turn itself around.

Wrong move. Now those may pay off, but it's pretty solidly risky with IV in Mars orbit right now. The play here is to sell puts to benefit from super high IV or buy shares.

No, in his contract with CNBC he cannot personally own stocks he talks about on his show.  He does, however, run a charitable fund that donates profits.  You have to join his private club to see the portfolio, and being a former member I can tell you that many of the names you hear about on the show are in there.  But it is a well-balanced portfolio of cyclical and growth stocks, so even if he wasn‚Äôt on TV it would make a good mix.
I am a GME üêª but since I have zero positions, and I see so many people prospering, I am bullish for you all. Best wishes to the tendies‚úã‚úã‚úã
I have no clue to be honest, but given the situation and the amount of volume traded, $50 - 55 does not seem out of the question.
50 or squeeze tomorrow.
Not an insider, so I am not sure. Nothing immediately obvious to an outsider I mean. But they just announced another successful project with Tate&Lyle, who make sweet&low and other artificial sweeteners using enzymes.
Only some brokers allow it and only after you make a special request.  

But don't worry,  you can buy shares now and strap on for the ride.

And I got 3 fucking upvotes!

I love this sub so much.
Here‚Äôs the thing: tech is here to stay. This idea of ‚Äòcycling‚Äô out of tech stocks is unlikely to happen for longer than a day. The world has changed and covid progressed it about 5 years when it was lagging.

Wall Street is catching up, albeit slowly. 

The difference going forward will be in how the tech ‚Äúpresents‚Äù itself in different ways. For example, I think you should have 100% tech and you‚Äôd have a great long term portfolio, but drilling down, you have a number of very computer-oriented ones. 

Think outside the box a bit - TEAM is great but maybe choose between it and MSFT, or between MSFT and AAPL for that matter.

eg. Consider something like PTON for a way of using tech to create communities and change the world of exercise. Consider cybersecurity like CRWD or NET.

Some health stocks which rely heavily on tech like TDOC; PINS for social media tech...the possibilities are endless.
So what I bought in at 40 what does it matter if it moons another +20%
Was down bc of PLUG sold and yolo‚Äôd everything into SPCE 32 calls expiring tomorrow right at the dip. Sold 30min later could have made more but holly fuck I‚Äôll take my 70% and run.
So I was supposed to hold my 1/15 25/26c?

45% interestmeana you pay 45% of borrowed stock value per year. If you want to short the 100k stocks available at iborrowdesk (assuming a price of 40$) you pay 40*100k/365=10960 dollars per day while shorting. 

If you short now you need it to fall fast to make money.
Just make enough and it won‚Äôt matter

This was the DD I was looking for.
I almost bought a Valve Index VR headset with some of today's realized gains, got as far as putting it in the shopping cart on Steam, and then thought "I could buy a ton of options with this $1000" and cancelled the transaction. 

GME 4/16 8C, GME long shares, BB 1/29 10C, PLTR 5/21 30C
You could start a paid discord and post your movies in real time
When do they expire ?
My 7 $30C 1/15 expire tomorrow for GME. After I exercise those I‚Äôm buying $4,000 in $55 1/22 ASAP
that‚Äôs gonna be tough. they just lost another plane out of Jakarta a few days ago...
I flipped a call option in $GME overnight for $546! I could have held and been greedy to probably make more money but decided to pull it out and pocket the profit today.
Give me an actual honest tl;dr on why it will continue to go up tomorrow and I‚Äôll drop 4.3k in shares right now
Where is it in setting? I don‚Äôt see it anywhere?
Holy fuck my first proper comment ever in this sub and all I'm doing is posting confirmation bias for myself to not feel alone in this gamble, and all you idiots follow suit... This truly is an autists paradise
Plz pump TNXP. I wanna be rid of it by close tomorrow
Buying is a big move.

IRS charges you 10% for taking money out of your 401k.  You could have just moved that over to an IRA on webull without taking the hit I believe.... that said, I'm not sure how "borrowing" works as you said it.  Do you still have to pay the IRS 10% if you return it by end of year?
i personally leave the retirement accounts on boomer mode and ignore it because i know i will fuck them up.

Missing out on GME made me say fuck it and throw some money down on BB.  Im such a moron.  Hopefully a rich moron tomorrow.
Probably going to incur a lot of wash sales and end up owing taxes for 2021 while generating no profit lol
I actually have a really solid location I‚Äôve been eyeing up. If we combine capital and talk to a couple lawyers I think we can do something sick.
Where is the setting?
What time he talkin 1 hr?
ahhh, that's not even high, we were seeing like 600+.
just dont lose in your retirement account as it won't be tax deductible. however, any gains you won't have to pay taxes on until you actually retire.

If a low dividend yield stock like NVDA makes you so emotional, you can just not buy it. You know that right?

Don‚Äôt think a squeeze is doable here.. Short ratio of 2, Bbby is more likely for a squeeze @ 7. BB is just gonna have a nice run up and maybe drop next week to around where it‚Äôs at now IMO
Is the evidence showing these are new investors? There must have been *some* sort of short squeeze. I don‚Äôt see how a stock could nearly double in 2 days based off rather small news. 

Also, if you‚Äôre correct it hasn‚Äôt, is there a reason to think the short squeeze ever *will* develop? I mean I don‚Äôt see why $40 a share would be much different than $100 a share. Either way, you‚Äôre a fuckin moron if you‚Äôre actually still shorting it at that point. So what‚Äôs to think their irrationality will stop at 100 versus 40?
Off the top of my head I don‚Äôt think iPhone 12 sales were down at all. I feel like i have read much to the contrary

I think the idea is that they pay *only* when a song comes on.  So instead of buying like a 'package' of songs, they only pay for the songs that actually play.  That's what it sounds like to me.

Generally holding one sector adds to your tick as you lack diversification.  It is tricky now as global trackers will hold amazing, Facebook etc as their largest holdings.

This subreddit is /r/options not /r/wallstreetbets. Just a joke about how one is traditionally well thought out plans, vs the absolute meme potential the mass of WSB wields. I usually try to keep it tame here just in the spirit of respecting people who aren‚Äôt degenerates like me.

But for those who missed it, a WSJ article on WSB and GME:

It was kind of wild getting mentioned at first since I‚Äôve been a long time lurker, and only in the last year became an active member. WSB has seriously been a crash course for me thats started to pay off. But we‚Äôre getting too much attention. Cramer needs a new hobby.

Absolutely. 

If I sold you a call and you paid 300 dollars premium on it I definitely could buy one for 100 dollars and close it out. Profit 200$

Me as the writer/seller could also just hope it expires worthless and I'll get the whole 300$.
Don't be that retarded
If you truly are a student of Buffett, you'll learn that selling is usually the worst thing unless you are sure that the new investment will do so much better than the original plus any tax bill you'll be paying. Read a lot. As you put new money into the account and invest using your newly learned skills, the old investments will become less of a % of the portfolio.

The point is to not rush to any extremes, in anything. Don't "the fool in the shower" (to use a Milton Freedman quote) who rushes to extremes, going back and forth between philosophies based on the latest book you've read.
it's a bit fiddly and not very useful.
I have the same god damn calls. I averaged up when i was down $150 and now im down $200 lmao.

I asked you for a number that's hard to get.

The fact that you are unable to find it doesn't make the question trolling.

The fact that you are unable to find it proves my point.

Thank you so much for facilitating.

Sounds like you did good then considering the shitty weather.
No idea but I was in just before close and sold out for 50% profit AH. I have a feeling it will climb through tomorrow but 50% in an hour felt too good to pass up.
Nope just in time for next week calls
That‚Äôs why government doesn‚Äôt tax the rich do hard. We need the rich, they keep the system flowing. But we also need the middle man to be happy as they are the majority and we don‚Äôt want the masses to revolt. Lol this is getting too political. 

That‚Äôs why I expect a boom in the coming years, There really is no alternative st this point. 

As average people we can only do one thing, ride the waves as good as we can, and try to be on the uppercase if the gap. Looking purely from a money perspective.

Don‚Äôt worry, employees won‚Äôt see any of it
With something like that, you pray and prepare yourself to lose 100% of your investment. Generally speaking, it is best to not buy far-OTM weeklies the day before expiry unless you are good with losing everything you put in. In the future, I‚Äôd suggest sticking to contracts that expire at least a month out
Buzz your girlfriend. WOOF.
Should I go heavy in stocks or go 1/22 calls
Define low.

Personal opinions on wage and FIRE success as a single individual, no dependents, started saving early in career -

Federal minimum wage: yeah no keep dreaming

40k pre-tax: it‚Äôs a stretch but if you‚Äôre in a low COL area it‚Äôs possible. Early retirement might mean 60

60k pretax: you‚Äôre probably able to max your 401k; it‚Äôs a long con but totally possible by 50-55 in MCOL or less if you keep up a solid savings rate.

75k and above: you‚Äôll probably make it in 90% of the United States by 50. Bay Area, LA, San Diego, Seattle, and NYC excluded. You won‚Äôt have a lambo but you‚Äôll be reasonably comfortable.
you spelled PLTR wrong
Maybe you should think about some other investment options.
Why is everyone here so easily convinced... I'm sorry don't hate me I know nothing
In all seriousness, ask at r/investing. It's a valid question.
Learnt this lesson too past couple days
I‚Äôm part of both, Godspeed my fellow tards.
Why is PLTR there though?
I was about to say though...

No one here claims to have out*smarted* institutions. 

Frankly, I'd say we out-retarded them so goddam hard that we came full circle and are winning
Same
There are different type of market crashes. During a catastrophe or financial credit crisis..all stocks go down. The best place to be are in low debt companies but nonetheless there isn't much you can do. See 2008 or 2020

If the crash is due to a contraction in valuations however.. everything will *still* go down.. but some will go down less than others..and then only those that were fairly valued to begin with will recover. See  1999, 1929.
Same I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower. But you make more money as a leader.
Retards and autists yes
Come on IWM keep going up
So BABA did not behave like an EV stock today after all...
WSB has flown to close to the sun

Very interesting I was looking a couple days ago and it looked like it wanted to break
calls on cauliflour rice
Going to see what GME does. Because it‚Äôs up another $2 ah and insiders are selling.
Why the hmmm?
Fuck
I'm balls deep in this tommorow
Lol I actually stopped believing in GME after their earnings killed the stock for a while. The fundamentals seemed so crap I didn't think there would be news that would cause it to pop. Shows what I know I guess. But I did want to get in on that ZM dip sigh. I Guess these are the opportunities you miss when you are chilling.

Buy GME shares
Lets go!
Collateralize the loans on both and do both. Don't liquidate your means of making money.
It may drop some, which is when you should buy. I don‚Äôt see it going below $35-33 again though. $100 price point is early 2022. Ryan Cohen is turning this ship around.
As long as you occasionally post the list on here then gteat
You aren't as smart you think you are.
Cancelled before fill at $1200, fixing to expire around $33k tomorrow
Their future posts should be flared appropriately

Can someone give me the 30 second ELI5 on why BB is still relevant and worth the chance?

I'm not a doubter, I'm a know-nothing-er who missed the memo that they were even still in business. Too poor for years to even think about stock (other than chicken), so I missed a lot of tech news. Why is this one set to blast off, exactly? :)
My dear friend. Pain is temporary, but pride is forever!
I have a 1k account and trade spreads all the time. Always close your position before expiration. Then you most likely won't get assigned.

When you do spreads, the whole point of it is to cover yourself from getting assigned. When you buy a call you have the option to buy stocks at a strike price, and when you sell a call you may get assigned to sell stocks at the strike. So if you do get assigned on the sell call rh should automatically exercise your buy call to cover it. 

Last thing if you have single leg options, rh should sell your position before you get assigned on expiration.

Bought back in at 9700 GME shares
That was the last  set that came out before I lost interest for a while. Great memories. Those are probably a good price since everyone is so focused on the very early stuff.
I theta Ganged my way to 7k from 3.5k now we yolo and see what happens
Tsla goes through cycles on this sub. It will kill off a good number of people portfolios, stay down for a little while, then pump again. R.I.P. sept 2020. I was there

I'll get $GME tatted on my body if it hits $100 by EOM
My play would be a version of that with theoretically no risk, since shorting 838 Tilray and buying 1000 Apha makes you net neutral post merge. But, it would net you 3-4k minus any shorting fees unless I‚Äôm missing something

I'm not exactly sure what happens to stocks in hyper inflation so maybe someone else can enlighten me. But I would think your safest bet would be to invest in some foreign stocks

However, if usd crashes there's no reason that the whole world exonomy wouldnt crash. So in that case I suppose the best thing to hold would be gold

HOWEVER, if theoretically usd did crash to basically nothing which I doubt it will. Bitcoin would literally be unbelievably valuable, and could literally hit any number. Even like trillions or higher. Not saying this would or even could happen but it would be wild lol
It reminds me of the beginning of the game "The Oregon Trail"

Taxes. If nothing else, Hold onto your shares until you have had them for at least a year to avoid having to pay out taxes on your gains at a higher rate. I'm in a similar position as you. Learning about capital gains tax has made this decision easier.

Lol unfortunately pltr barely has any shorts
I had 1100 in the bank at 16 you autist
TenCent along with baba are being looked at for a blacklist it was all over the place last week
Arnt they to expensive?
Buying OPK. They own Bioreference labs and the Biden healthcare stimulus plans is allocating $50B for testing and $130B for reopening schools. Bioreference is already doing the biggest school districts in the country now. Market cap is $3B. Also a few drugs that will be approved this year. OPK is severely undervalued
If a stock has a $39-$40 bid-ask in AH, an I likely to get filled at 39.5 for a sell order?
Shares my dude.  IV will fuck you.
Good call. WSB is leaking. These pumpers try and recreate the hype and then their stock flounders. Meanwhile at GME, backed by legitimate multi-year DD by some posters (YD? Yearly diligence?) that shit took off and didn't stop.
I just bought TSLA today, now what?
I bought yesterday before the drop today like a fucking idiot

Volumes are too low. All spread out over 20 countries and markets. They should merge all the euro stock markets together to 1 and close all the others. Then it might get some rocket moving volumes on some stocks. Also, buying euro stocks as a european with a european broker is often like 5 to 10 times more expensive in brokerage fees than buying usd markets.
But you could buy a clean 7.3 power stroke ford that will appreciate faster than a house and still be a truck

Do I buy shares now or wait for a dip at open?
Dayummmmmm
What positions are you looking at ?
No, of course not. People whine about taxes but paying a lot in taxes just means you made even more. You'll potentially get to enjoy the fruits of your investment, so why not? IMHO spreading things out in a balanced manner is best, so don't ignore retirement accounts of course. 

Of course I'm no DeepFuckingValue so I basically know nothing.
$WOOF.
Gamma squeeze due to hedging of positions today I think. No way that was the bulk of the short squeeze.

Question: are ppl buying shorts/options or just stocks?
if you don't give a shit about the facebook thing the Quest 2 is pretty awesome for $300. If you have a Desktop or Laptop that plays steam VR games, you can play PCVR games wirelessly by sideloading an app and spending $20 on the Quest version of Virtual Desktop. You can also do this with a VM on a shit laptop but I haven't really looked into it too much.
Yo, did this just get banned? what's with the auto moderator?

Hold up there Jimmeh - WSB created some of finest DDs one could need to invest in proper ticker. Memes and stuff is one thing, but among those there is shit ton of very valuable info. Once you get past initial retardation you don't need to get info from anywhere else to successfully trade shares. Sometimes even options.
The FB drop lately honestly doesn't make sense. 
Their earnings are gonna be monsterrr. There was insane levels of adspend in q4 on their platforms

I've bought and sold CRM 3x in as many months -- each time at, like, a $10 loss, each time to invest in a meme (or pre-meme) stock. Degeneracy has set in. 

Long term I'm bullish, definitely plan to buy in again at some point.
Starting to smell like we're going to be the fall guys
What ever happened to the earnings threads?  I miss the loud wails of agony and incoming/inevitable loss porn follow ups.
If you watch how the difference in price moves between strike prices as the share price goes up, you‚Äôll see there is greater change at the higher OTM strike price than the lower ITM strike price

+ imagine buying the $40 strike for $20.23

+ as share price goes up, that cost will go up to $25.75 where the $20 atrike price us now (using the numbers you wrote above as example)

+ that $50 strike price for $15.63 will be worth more as the share price increases - to maybe $20.23 where the $40 strike price is now

+ the difference is less between the $20 and $30 strike prices

Buy cheaper OTM to open contract

+ sell when the contract gains in higher change in premium when it is closer to ITM

I would caution against going too headlong into this. Let‚Äôs remember that during Obama‚Äôs *eight* years in power, sure some EPA rules got changed and goals were set, but arguably most of the boost in renewables was a result of the sectors own innovation and long term outlook. He was able to get ultimately ~80 billion spent, so this talk of hundreds of billions isn‚Äôt grounded in political reality. Much of that money was in the form of tax credits, so although both allow more money into the game, it‚Äôs not quite the same as JPow printing money. 

But wait? That 80 billion wasn‚Äôt even passed by itself! It was part of the 2009 bailout and stimulus attempts. **One**bill in 8 years, the Recovery Act. Most of the stimulus train already left the station this time around. Plain old stimmy money can‚Äôt affect stock prices the way actual forward investments and innovation can. And too much money just gets wasted (Solyndra). Not only that, these programs aren‚Äôt always effective anyways. One tiny example: You know all that money poured into energy efficient fridges? [One study found](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9gysfmwwsmfkmz5/Houde%20and%20Aldy%20AEJ-Policy%202017.pdf?dl=0) that 90% of people would have purchased one of them anyway.

I‚Äôm super confused because I‚Äôm not well-versed in the music industry sector.

So, when you go into a restaurant and they have music on in the background, the restaurant would have to pay to use that background music?
The drugs and gambling kind.

Shit, this is kid can barely talk and still probably has more tendies than me
My bro is playing this and mentioned it to me. If I wasn't almost all in GME I would hop in.
Have a non-paywall transcript?
restaurants that have venues for musicians to play and charge to heart them should be paying a royalty to the original artists. After all, it was originally that artist's hard work in the case of cover bands. Only about 15% of venues pay royalty licensing fees because its prohibitively expensive for smaller places. Soundstr provides a pay-as-you-go model which means that everyone pays their fair share AND the royalties are going to end up in the right pockets because the data is just better. It's a win-win for everyone. The talent in the music industry seems to love this concept and I believe it will take off.
Thanks for asking for more info. Well when it healed it created a fistula. Check it out online. Basically a tunnel from where the cyst was opened. Had to have a bunch of hot nurses come in everyday and looks at my assholes. Definitely the best part IMHO.

I'm creaming myself right now that I got orders filled for stock and 1/22 9.50 calls like two minutes before close.
June?? Not sure we have to wait that long üòé
Why is BB up?
Stop I need to get in tomorrow
Tomorrow
When does this hell end. I sold my $6.5c 1/29 BB  option for ICLN. What a clutz
Sorry man I didn't see how long ago you made your comment, I'm just browsing through haha. Good job though, seriously you made a great mode on dumping your position, you rode the shit out of that rollercoaster.

I think I'm going to get into BB tomorrow also, but just like you I'm going to buy shares, I don't think options is the right move for me with regards to BB you know?
Or a time traveler....
I don't pay taxes in Switzerland.
Should‚Äôve held my 1/15 40c huh :/ at least I‚Äôve got 1/29 55c and some shares still
Buy at open or you‚Äôre retarded
I would give this comment Gold, but I spent all my money on GME
When will calls be available? When they print I want be like

Please don't thank me lmao you have no idea if this was a good or a terrible investment...
Get in now.  The cavalry are dealing with GME right now.  We are just getting the launch pad ready and doing pre flight checks.  As soon as they arrive this shit will explode. Compared to other cyber security firms BB is tiny.  Could easily reach $50 by end of Jan.
First purchase will be GME, cause it‚Äôs headed to Pluto üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄü™ê

remember how long Tesla shorts held on, those shorting GME have deep pockets, let‚Äôs take them for all they‚Äôre worth! not selling till over 100!
I just got my tax statement from Ameritrade - they listed every trade I did last year.  Irs is well aware of what we are doing
Buy GME

Thanks, you too! Let‚Äôs keep it going üöÄ
What is a realistic price target for tomorrow? 10.5 and then sell off after open? Or a meteoric rise to 15$
GME for triple digit . You never missed it out . Those chicken tenders are hot from the oven
You're in for a treat
Buy BB or GME shares right now?
My only concern is Sherman not letting the squeeze run before he pulls out the shelf offering.

We better see at least $100 first they let the shorts off the hook.
We can‚Äôt dilute the the squeeze all the troops to gme üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
It‚Äôs shit sell. I‚Äôm selling my calls at open
whenever my futures order gets filled it IMMEDIATELY goes the opposite direction.  I'm putting my bids in below the market from now on, fuck this
Amazon cucking me harder than a guy‚Äôs girlfriend having an only fans...
Wasn‚Äôt that yesterday?????
Nah we just have to pump it with upvotes harder than we pumped GME so it gets to front page.
First of all. The share float is significantly lower than 3 to 4 years ago. Therefore each share is worth more. 

Secondly, the trading environment is drastically different. Retail is totally FOMO'ing and the shorts are absolutely panicking. 

They aren't even close to out of the woods. Tomorrow will be fireworks.
Yeah I'm considering more if it continues it's recent trend.

Noone say APPS? seriously?
Yeah agreed. Those are just my biggest worries for the country. My goal is to have enough money saved to leave the country when/if things get bad enough. I do think we‚Äôre years and years away from that happening though.
In this case your not betting on a direction of the industry overall, your betting the company you bought the call on will gain market share from the company bought the put on. Like earlier in the year if thought AMD was going to saor and you bought calls but the reason you thought that was because intel would be handing them customers due to delays and being bad or whatever, then perhaps you‚Äôd want to do what your describing. I‚Äôm not a pro or anything, this is just how I see it.
Yup that's the one!
People should not worry about the SEC or funds or whatever coming after a message board that is so retarded it wouldn't know what to do with insider information. We should do what financial institutions do and get a self-regulating body to pretend like we are all in compliance. Can call it BALLSDEEP.
Absolutely.
pissed I missed out on BB. Good DD by the guy, spot on. Ugh. Bummer.
Short squeeze hasn‚Äôt even started. Not too late üöÄüöÄüöÄ
QCLN
They are just betting that they can outspend us. In the end, this is what it is, the first one to flinch losses, and they are dead sure we're going to start selling when people start having nice gains, sending this down. If we can't get a perpetual flow of new buyers, they are going to win. They can just post more and more collateral to maintain their positions until the selling starts. It's going to be interesting.

It‚Äôs encouraging to see another middle aged person who went back to school.

I‚Äôm not really looking to gain more knowledge (although that would be nice, too) but the degree would give me the opportunities I would like to have access to in my field which I don‚Äôt have access to without this degree.

My husband and I could afford the payments. 

Another question, though - can I even withdraw nearly the entire amount? It‚Äôs at just above 30,000 and I need just under 30,000.
There's still so much time left on GME.

Okay, maybe I should've explained better, but this is what has happened so far: I was selling puts on a stock, and I got eventually assigned since it closed below the strike. I've been selling covered calls since then on this 100 lot. So, now I'm just wondering if there's any difference between using the option rollover tool, as opposed to just let the covered call expire worthless, and then just buying the next contract.

I think personally it might die down a little and people might panic sell or something, but unless there is an actual market crash I think it's obvious to hold renewable shit until this next bill in Feb.

Capital gains taxes, 1031 exchanges, carried interest, increase in corporate tax, LLC visibility, etc.  Green regulations (I'm in favor for) also add to the cost of new construction.  

However, on the other end existing product has seen massive cap rate compression, thereby increasing the value of existing properties.  Cap rates are similar to P/E.  NOI (NCF)/Cap Rate = Price.  The denominator decreases, the price increases.

If you want a fairly descriptive way, first take a look at textbooks for a Geology depts ‚ÄúEconomic Geology‚Äù course for the last part of the 20^th century‚Äô.   Look at a class/text that teaching majors can teach and find a text with plenty of diagrams.  

Helps to know the basics of each machine as engineers can modify (usually with software) even old machinery.   May also help to pick up a basic geology text, know the ‚Äúrock cycle‚Äù, etc   My course included oil and our ‚Äúlab‚Äù (field trip) for that week was a refinery visit that week.  So if you can find a descriptive treatment of oil fractionalization, that‚Äôll help.

I remember him saying that he would probably be better off if he never sold anything, and him telling another story of how they sold intel in the late 80s. At the same time, I just fundamentally know these companies aren‚Äôt for me (super overvalued companies compared to cash flows like draftkings for example). Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to allocate that capital to a few positions I really like instead? Or no because I‚Äôm so new?
We sure he still has the puts and they haven't been sold?
It depends on what the deal was. Sometimes it is for a set price, in which case you will get the agreed upon price per share. Other times it will be converted to a certain amount of the other companies stock. 

I think I remember reading that Fitbit agreed to a cash deal. So you will get whatever the agreed upon amount was and your shares will disappear.

Fuck this got me hyped.
But...we actually are causing the short squeeze LMAO
I agree, but let's be sure to give him the benefit of being able to change. Today and yesterday had a completely different tone than the day before that. I hope it continues, we can learn a lot from him, but nobody learns anything if they are insulted by the teacher.
If it does and I sold my weeklies today at a huge loss for no reason I will literally off myself
I'm going deep on FB for earnings. monster levels of ad spend on their platform in q4.
As a surgery chief resident, I salute you and wish I had gotten into this at your age.  Also, will be graduating my MBA debt-free for the same reason as you.

My advice, put some TSLA and PLTR aside and do not touch until you're an attending (at least).  More importantly, don't be a gomer.
>why would anyone play GME is beyond me

Who‚Äôs the retard now, retard?
Definitely. Or the tie.
More than that.

It's confusing.

Just as it's confusing to know what my social security benefits will be.

I picked up a letter that arrived to my dad's last year and then forgot it, haha. It seems to predict that I'll get like $500/month or so, but in 2042 (approx.) dollars...and I don't know how it works, like if I get more if the fund does well or get less if it doesn't. 

I remember way back when that it seemed to me that I only would receive benefits for 5 years...but maybe that was saying, "if you pull $X, it will run out in 5 years"?

I don't know.

I'll find out in 20 years!

Like a Christmas present.

Same with social security. When I hit 60 I'll look into it more deeply.

Our plan is to hopefully not need either and have this be gravy.

As stated before, my life is weird.

I also have strange delusions of grandeur - like one day I'll write the Great American Novel and none of this will matter - which is dumb, because I've already written a novel and did not wind up getting it published. My NEXT book will be 10x better though, for a number of reasons, which are too long to type out or talk about without wine, whiskey or beer.
Tell that to the banks that were bailed out on the taxpayer's dime while college education costs ballooned. Many people with legitimate degrees were forced to put their careers, based on legitimate degrees, on hold for half a decade or more while loan interest continued to rack up. Favoring the wealthy with economic policies for the last 20 years is what has exasperated wealth inequality and there's no end in sight as long as people are working off debt.
I was never great at mixing
It depends on how your plan is set up. Probably not that much. Just call the custodian and ask.
Mark also seems keen on turning a mind eye to China's human right violations so he can keep doing business with them.
thinking of selling to more more company based stocks.

GTTLX i;ve only made 3720 profit in a span of 5 years 

JAGLX i;ve made 3261 profit in a span on 5 years

HCAIX i've made a profit of 14,564 in a span of 5 years

Is that considered good in a span of 5 years?
Yes we will honey
Can't buy options, but most platforms you can buy shares. On TOS, you just have to choose EXT as the time so it'll execute during extended hours.

Uh, I‚Äôm often accused of being an Apple fan boy, so... of course! 


Their yoy holiday App Store sales were over 30% higher.  


Now that increase was not because people spent more on apps.  It‚Äôs more likely due to MORE people spending money on apps.  The most big spending happens when people get new devices (they often get gift cards with said devices when the device is a Christmas gift).  


In addition to that, the inventory and channel checks seem to indicate a 40% increase in phone sales.  


In addition to the increased sales, their margins appear to be higher too.  


In addition to increased Q1 sales, we all got a stimulus & every time there‚Äôs a stimulus, people buy Apple products (look at apples increased sales during the last stimulus package - they beat forecasts). 


And with talk about an Apple Car, people are giddy about the stock altogether.   


So when they confirm increased sales & increased outlook for the year (that‚Äôs the big deal), Apple will shoot to $150 pretty quick.  


In short, GME üöÄ üöÄ lol
Do yourself a favor and make a budget (if you haven't already) before you close any doors behind you. You have the cost of groceries, property tax, water, electric, home maintenance, gas, insurance. Price out health care before you step out, too.

Ooooo boy we're likely gonna summon the SEC by accident
Lmao your portfolio went higher than her cholesterol
Not even close. They only have 0.02 delta and 53k OI so 100k shares hedged. GME is so hard to borrow the MMs are hedging a good bit with further otm puts

We already saw the price action from those hedges being unwound when the delta tanked from 0.8
If everyone but the current sell order book diamond handed GME could hit $80 tomorrow easy
Haha whatever you think pal I‚Äôm sitting here with gains, are you
Yeah bill is too expensive to include infra

GME
You really think GME is going to change the world?  At least a case could be made for Tesla but GME not so much.
Crazy to think about. Bitcoin would be the most valuable currency on Earth if the US experiences hyperinflation in the future. May need to start stocking up haha
Yup. Up till 40. And if retired around 40 (or sooner of course) because of WSB help it's "Forever young" by Alphaville.

Come to think of it I will play this tune, right after Ecstacy of gold once I will get to around $1.3M and retire.
BB is the first time I've ever watched a stock after hours.  


This makes me happy. My calls are gonna print hard af in the morning.
Okay thanks. Insulation the guy didn‚Äôt even care. Rough in inspection was a bitch though
I think it‚Äôs ok if you check, but don‚Äôt beat yourself up if you miss going to the moon because you were taking time off you know?
So you buy ITM calls. How far ITM?.. Just what you can afford?
No one should beat themselves up about missing GME.  People post better DD with good justifications all the time and they flop.  Going all in on something like GME was objectively fucking retarded but it did work out extremely well.  Just saying think before blindly dumping money into shit because of fomo.

please sue bae!!! :pray:
Because thats what we are, we are retarded. Don't you think gambling all your life savings on a company, just because some autist on reddit told you so, isn't retarded?

Ya, it would def be more useful to use forward looking metrics. I just don't have a lot of confidence in forward looking estimates for many of these companies going into 2021. So to be a bit more conservative I like to stick with trailing twelve months.

For me, I try to find companies with a score of under 0.50. I think those companies are very well priced relative to revenue. (assuming they have high gross margins)
Institutions selling those contracts will purchase/sell shares in response to people buying them. Which will then in turn increase share price

Payoff your debt. Put 3-6 months worth of expenses into a savings account for and Emergency Fund. Don't touch it unless you have a real Emergency. Open a ROTH and put in the max for 2021, $6000. Put the rest in some good growth mutual funds. Create a monthly budget that includes you contributing 15% of your income to a retirement plan. Treat yourself to a steak dinner to celebrate being on the path to becoming a millionaire.

I already have 2 LEAPs on ICLN that I'm up quite a bit on, and I'm bullish in general.

Even if this doesn't move after Biden's speech today, I'm expecting some movement once he's formally inaugurated and gives more details on his environment and infrastructure plan.
How'd you get that?

the short interest is spiking because the capital groups are counting on this sub losing interest in GME at some point and moving on to something else, at which point the stock will crater and they'll make all the money they're presently losing back - and then some.

&#x200B;

The solution, of course, is to keep our boots on their throats until they give up and eat their shit sandwich.  That's why it pisses me off when people say they "missed" GME like it's over or are talking about cashing out and rolling to something else.  The fucking thing is moving up double digits every day and you want to leave in the middle of the run?

No problem, so currently yes they have "dealerships" so there are these larger spaces which compose of places for NIO owners to have their children play, coffee shops, they host events for owners like wine tastings etc (This is called a NIO house) , then they have something called a NIO space where you can see them in a mall for example where they will have all their models present, but none of those extra amenities.

They are more expensive but do provide many more luxurious features in comparison to Tesla from what I've heard from owners on the NIO app and YouTube, the attention to detail and the build quality is much better (no shoddy fixes and panel gaps).

They are not vertically integrated however, they have a joint venture with their manufacturing partner and they work together to lower costs, their vehicle margin is currently at 12.5% it was at -12.5% the year prior.

There is significant demand, we should hear about pre orders for the ET7 in the next Q4 call in March and currently they have a 4 month backlog of orders which is roughly 25 000 vehicles. 

NIO operates in a more luxury market compares to tesla, as they provide a lot of custom services, like insurance, roadside charging whenever you need it, battery swaps, superchargers all free of charge and a whole host of other benefits.

time for WSB to open their own short position like melvin
Imo unlikely bc losing millions down to zero in a position is gonna look real bad for Melvin etc. Cutting losses by covering will always be better.

Hypothetically, if they do let them expire though, there's still the matter of market makers. As mentioned, when they sell puts they balance this bull position by shorting the stock in order to become delta neutral. Significantly less open puts, more open calls = market makers buy more of the stock.
Fuckin sweet lets go bois! We will all be forever young!
Already owned PLTR, yes please.
Legit all of this board got hard when this announcement dropped.
Here‚Äôs the thing about infrastructure, you need to tax people to pay for it. How you tax them comes by lots of names but the money doesn‚Äôt just appear.

But half the (voting) country is dead set against taxes to pay for things they are demanding. Until we get political leaders at all levels of government (city -> federal) who are willing to raise taxes to pay for infrastructure it will continue to fall apart.

My state DOT is forecasting a 50% shortfall for _maintenance_ expenses in the next 5 years because of partisan anti-tax gridlock. Yet at the same time those anti-tax legislators are demanding increased spending on transit systems.

Fat fucking tendies to be had bro. It's up north of 10.50 from a close of 9.11.
GME BB SPCE APHA
That's the worst part. It's likely to come back again if you don't get it right the first time. It has like a 50% chance of coming back.
He sounds absolutely shit faced drunk
The reason is because the law suit form the DOJ. They wanna break up FB for being too big & it might happen.
Last night I got so high off edibles that I started consciously thinking about how weird it is to be a living, breathing human being, then I thought the world was a global warmed wasteland destroyed by oil/gasoline. All of this was way too real last night

Stop being poor, hold GME and just buy BB
You killed me with the PLTR part.  I'm half GME half PLTR.  I want to take gme gains and just roll into PLTR leaps.
I got in on the [Micron](https://i.imgur.com/Kz4RnYg.jpg) hype in 2017. Still holding from then. I'd say it's going well.
These 1000c i have r dead to me
XLE i really could choose one oil stock but several of the ones mentioned as good potential bets for this year a listed in this ETF.
Have you taken a look at A M C? Looks like the next GME.
I‚Äôm actually so excited for tomorrow. Should be like last week.
tplee for some reason
Someone explain to me why everyone thinks PLTR will have the same journey as GME? Im bullish, but shorts only have like 7% of the float there vs GMEs 100+


Is this just wishful bs, or is there a technical similarity I'm missing?
I really want to see the open position of someone who shorted earlier this year.

Haha thanks I will see what I can do
how about the Plaid IPO theyve been discussing?????
I guess that makes a little more sense, but I doubt they paid the new guy the same as what the old guy was making and they're still saving money overall. I understand that it's a large corporation, but I don't think that's much of an excuse either. They need to start paying up and giving proper raises or people will just leave. Especially if you're in software the number of available jobs (including remote so you could remain in your LCOL area) are significant.

Working with one company for over 13 years seems pretty crazy to me, but if you enjoy the work and make decent enough money to retire soon there's no reason not to stay. I agree it's all about balance I just hate the excuse that because it's a large corporation they can't pay. On the contrary because they're a large corporation and large corporations are raking in the money they should be paying you higher salaries compared to other potential positions.
What happened?
1.	Know that trading options is gambling and be prepared to lose
2.	as much as I hate RobinHood, it‚Äôs user friendly and explains how buying or selling calls and puts works.
3.	YouTube if you don‚Äôt want to try out RobinHood 
4.	buy GME shares
Warren Buffet owns a lot of shares in it so yes.
Also when would I sell it? At the expiration date? Or when it hits $10. I‚Äôm so sorry I‚Äôm just tryna learn I‚Äôm such a noob
Why buy at open? I honestly don‚Äôt know
exactly. Think more like music venues, bars, clubs, etc. Most commercial businesses and restaurants that stream music in ceiling speakers and such do so from a streaming service so they are in effect paying their share (assuming it's a service for businesses).
The clean exit
Hi there!

From what I can tell you've got a great start going on your retirement savings and college savings for the girls. The emergency fund seems solid too. Based on what you've written, I'm assuming you don't have any outstanding credit card debt (if you did, I'd say use the extra cash to pay that down!).

A few thoughts for you:

1. I wouldn't look at your company stock as your emergency fund. Your emergency fund should really be in cash. Stocks are volatile (and options are even more volatile) so you shouldn't look at them as emergency cash.
2. You mention that you have stock options and that they will vest soon. Theoretically, it's best to hold on to the option as long as you can and wait to close to the expiration date before exercising. You can look at these options as your ticket to potential aspirational wealth since you've already done a good job in terms of saving for retirement and college.
3. If you still have cash left over (it was hard for me to follow whether you've got $30k or $80k to invest), I would say -- if you're not sure about what you'd like to spend it on then put it in a 50/50 mix of stock and bond ETFs. If you end up deciding to buy the hot tub -- sell the bond ETFs to fund it. If you end up buying nothing then you'll get the benefit of the return on the stocks+bonds.
4. Putting money into the house -- I think that right now (with all of us in the house more..) putting money into your house for improvements is a great investment. Make the house more liveable/enjoyable and I don't think you'll regret the spend!

Good luck!

You ever just crush the market and sit back and think.... ‚ÄúDamn I can‚Äôt believe I made this off the internet.‚Äù
Last one was the absolute worst. Created a fistula and they needed to basically rip my asshole a new one. Literally. Couldn't sit for weeks.
You do have a few choices, but you didn‚Äôt say how long ago you sold the covered calls, what the premium was, if you would like to hold on the stock(s), or are you happy with the return you‚Äôve already made. But if you wanted to keep one or even all 3 of the stocks above you probably can, by rolling your covered calls up and out. An example would be, for ARKK, the Jan 15th 133 call closed at around $12.50 
You could perhaps buy those back tomorrow morning, and sell the Feb 19th 140 call for probably a small credit, or a March 19th 145 call for maybe a slightly larger credit.  Not advice, just a thought. Always nice to be in a profitable position (at this time). And by keeping the stocks, there is always the risk they could go back down in the future.

If you bought shares just hold them. If you're new to this then you probably didn't buy an option, because you have to opt in to get the ability to buy them. You might see it dip in the short term but if it's a long term investment, just hold your shares tbh it'll be worth it in a few years
ENPH up decently AH
I hope there‚Äôs momentum building up to it
It depends on how you set it. My broker sets a trailing stop limit as a percentage, and then you set a specific selling limit.
Like, "if it falls 10%, sell no less than $X.xx"

it's a good long play if you're willing to wait but tbh I don't expect it to moon in one big jump

PLTR stands for People Love The RMoney meaning that the only place it's going is up
Holy mother fuck
100 pennies make a pound. 100 cents barely make a sound - unless you have a hundred thoussssaaand you could play it cool and buy one hundred ‚Äî but you‚Äôll look a right fool if it becomes the full pound‚Äî and your left jabbing zeros into your calculator, scratching your head at why you didn‚Äôt just suck it the fuck up and buy 100,000....
Is there some online resource that could teach a complete idiot to understand whatever you just said?
What‚Äôs going on with BB?
Ahh gotcha. Stripe is bigger in terms of revenue, in 2019 they had $450M vs ~$100M of Plaid if I recall correctly, so more likely well known (these numbers likely doubled under the pandemic and online purchases sore). 

Personally, I think Plaid is more of a long-term risky disruption play ‚Äì they have the opportunity to completely disrupt the current payments network system. For example, instead of having to go through card networks, Plaid's technology allows you to withdraw directly from bank accounts. 

Right now, that tech is used to fund Venmo accounts, but could hypothetically be used to buy anything. That's seemingly the main reason Visa wanted to acquire them and why the DOJ blocked the acquisition. There's a ton of opportunity for a disruption that would hurt Visa, and they likely hoped to prevent it by buying them out.  

Stripe is interesting as well but has a lot of similar competitors ‚Äì Adyen, Square, Paypal, etc. Likely less disruptive than Plaid, but it's hard to predict the future.
Fuck bitches, make money

GME Shares
If that‚Äôs what everyone does then I need to join in but I need to know how far back I would need to set the time to on that website between 6 hours and 7 days
but that requires them to have the shares, right? like they would be naked shorting if they don't have the shares, right? i thought that if you short a stock like this and it's rising like crazy you basically have unlimited loss potential.
It's not about the politics---my favorite part of WSB is its un-shaking commitment to making tendies no matter who's in charge.  Go look at the discord for yourselves, they're like our cancerous cousins, we don't need them.

It's all relative. ABNB is far less volatile than some other things I have been trading and mentioned. For some people, stable is a GIC. For others, it's a mutual fund or an index fund. For others its blue chips.
I don't understand your post. Psec and ARR are the exact opposite of Hormel. Hormel is a company that grows, while psec is a company that is shrinking.

Psec had a $0.40 dividend each quarter in 2008. Now it has $0.06 per month or $0.18 per quarter.

Is there anything big and not obvious one should do if they expect to never marry for building up their savings and investments? Not against the idea or looking to start any arguments that might get this deleted or get me banned. Who knows, maybe it'll happen, but I haven't had great luck and currently it seems unlikely. And the vast majority of information from tax rates to descriptions of strategies, always looks at married rates (and often 2 kids, the "average" family). My whole reasoning behind pursuing FI is out of security (mainly being able to maintain a reasonable quality of life without undue sacrifice such as being forced to work extremely long hours or relocate to somewhere undesirable in order to not run out of money if my career falls apart for whatever reason) , so planning for the worse outcomes and what they could mean to my strategy is important. Hitting a specific retirement date is not important to me at the moment, but not ending up like the scores of people my parents age who were fighting 16 year old me for minimum wage jobs in 2008 is vital. As is not being forced to leave the mountain west while I'm still physically fit enough to enjoy the various outdoor recreation activities I love. It seems some things are significantly diminished if single, particularly tax advantages. Things like tax rates, standard deduction and how they relate to things like the Roth conversion for example. While expenses do not double for two people, since housing and utilities will be very similar,  and the more frugal may go with a single car and other shared resources as well. Is there anything else less obvious i might not know about that should be looked at? So far I've been investing entirely in tax advantaged accounts via HSA,  traditional 401k, Roth IRA, and megabackdoor Roth. I do not make enough money to max out the megabackdoor but everything else I do max. And I own a small townhouse with about 100k in equity thanks to rapidly increasing prices here. And no taxable investment accounts of any kind.
XL- primed for reversal and then major breakthrough. Expecting $24+ tomorrow and close to $30 next week or two before earnings.

So you think the median active investing participant on this subreddit is running between $4.6k and $5.8k of notional? Bc of all the option buying I see here it's probably safe to say many are levered, so maybe 1/10 of that is the ulnevered number -- ~$500... yeah that actually seems reasonable but I'm not sure how many of you are using options vs holding outright -- I suspect the less active participants are not familiar enough to be trading options?

As a former Ski/board instructor, I can provide insight

* Contrary to popular belief, most Ski/board instructors are not highly skilled skiers or boarders.  At least 3 of the new hires had to Ski pizza down a green run. 
* 96% of lessons are first time lessons.  The expectation is you will go up the lift once. 
* The pay is bad.  You see numbers like $18/hr to $26/hr and it looks nice.  In reality, you wake up before the sun, drive up to the mountain, are only paid when you teach and the max you work is 4-5 hours. You are back home past 5pm. Oh and the best part is you may not get a lesson and may not make any money for the day. 
* When you are not teaching there is limited time to Ski on your own. Most instructors simply never get out. 
* There is a significant $ to get to the ski resort.  You need a 4WD vehicle on a regular basis and you go up significantly in elevation.  This eats at your net income.

I can go on, but I think you get the point.  If you are an instructor for several years, then you will get favoritism and things are significantly nicer but never great.
So FCEL is a pile of garbage again?
So what's the long term play here? Is GME worth holding for a year or more?
What is it normally?

VTSAX and VITAX with VTCLX in a taxable account (although if I had to do it over again I‚Äôd just keep it simple and forget VTCLX).  When I want to pivot slightly to bonds, I plan on VBTLX.

Now, all of this said, my primary net worth growth source is my business, not my investments, which are really just my backup plan and a way to diversify myself beyond putting every dollar in my business.  Matching market historical returns or even undershooting a bit that in a long term funk will still work for me.

i tried theta gang and sold a put for a measly $175 and that shit was boring as fuck.  how do you guys do it?
People will be looking deeper into r/wallstreetbets too. You guys are beasts.
these boomers will never understand how broke we are.  The yolo is the only way to get out of hell for us.  God bless this young warrior.  you'll be 18 in no time buddy, stay strong, there's always a GME on the horizon.
Holy shit I remember i bought MJ at $36 something in 2018 and that POS etf still no where near where i sold it at üòÇüòÇ biggest POS on the market besides FB

Also...I am impressed that you misspelled biscuit, ergo, spelled Biskit correctly...given that you're not a regular consumer of this particular salty processed treat.
Well one of mine do, the other is gme
Where do you see this fake news? 

An extra 10k shares lol. Exercising 1000 calls would be 1000 \* 100 = 100,000 shares. 

Also, please familiarize yourself with what a comma is, you might get a few in your bank account if you wise up, like Game Cock.

Fuck dude it might print who fucking know what tomorrow holds
Sorry, I was a bit sarcastic... sometimes I do it if their research appear legit but you have to be careful.
dude you have to be absolutely joking me. everyone has known about this transition for a long ass time now.  and if you were an actual investor that took the time to follow these companies then you listened to their last earnings call where they admitted they are literally lighting money on fire while every single competitor is printing tendies. i hope you guys can pump it - i really do.  but the stock is absolute F-tier dumpster fire garbage.
My 10 c hope so
Totally new to trading, since the market is down should I put in a market order for market open tomorrow or is that too risky?

The only question is why not sooner.  I followed at night when it closed at $32 ended up buying in at 37 in the morning and now it‚Äôs 42 I think the day of reckoning will be tomorrow

I agree. This is far more than \*just\* a President Biden play. This is also a momentum play based on the entire sector gaining ground. People and municipalities are going green because that's the thing to do these days. They're buying fuel cell based buses, getting solar panels installed everywhere they can, switching to green energy alternatives, installing electric bike sharing, etc. You also have companies like BLNK getting global investment like with South Korea investing 1.5 billion dollars into them just a week or two ago.

&#x200B;

That's also part of why I think ICLN is a good choice. Because its holdings are not actually majority US companies, it has companies all over the world. Clean energy is becoming a worldwide movement due to concerns over the environment, and I believe that will be reflected in the stocks.

SENS and GME. Both went crazy today. SENS is up 35 percent and then another 40 in AH rn.
You shut your traps about GE. I'm balls deep in it. If this turn around story is real, I will suck the new CEO clit.
ENPH pump yesterday, just as when Joe buyden announced he will address energy plans tomorrow. All the other renewables closed at red. **Somebody definitely knows something**
I like how they trying to bait you into buying "research reports"  with a free one from GME. This a set up

Keep pushing TLRY
Me too... So I can buy the dip! üòé
This one is going to hurt for a while. I loaded up on $25c all the way down until last Friday, but then I couldn't stand it any longer and sold them for a couple hundred dollars. They would have now been worth almost $2k a piece. In hindsight, they were worth so little I should have just held and let them ride anyway. I feel so bad.
I have shares. I think I will.
Nah fuck it. I‚Äôm yolo all in for the first time starting a couple days ago. Massive gains. There‚Äôs still time to hop on the tendie train, it‚Äôs gonna take a while for this to burn out
I was just in the kitchen eating soup thinking "That wasn't very hard, it's not like I am skilled."
Yeah I just checked, Tesla's market cap was even larger than PLTR's current market cap at the start of 2020, and that didn't do a damn thing to stop it from mooning the whole year...
Thats a lie lol. 500 to 10k yesterday maybe but definitely not today.
CRTX is worth doing DD on. I think it's going to boom soon.
Freakin pot stonks, going up AH after I sold my calls ...
Nice, those are gonna print so much.
WSB correctly predicted what appears to be a short squeeze. I think majority of people believe it will continue up at least for the next few days, as people shorting GME are forced to cover their positions. It's speculation, but seems more sure than most WSB meme stocks. Good luck to you.

Why is there still shorts in GME. What‚Äôs the infatuation. They‚Äôve been horsefucked since May
It means "super diamond hands"
Where do you guys watch after hours ??
What in the actual fuck
Damn TSLA recall
They took one quote directly from WSB that makes us look so much worse imo than if they had quoted any of us saying our girlfriends get fucked by dudes while we watch and check robinhood. They quoted us saying "we run the markets now."
that's certainly disappointing. 

following rubio's letter, one would have hoped biden would respond with a sincere effort to deliver stimulus to the american people. instead, biden just showed he's more interested in soundbites than actually getting something done.

he's putting non-stimulus related partisan poison pills in there like a $15 minimum wage. this bill will be as dead as the heroes act.
Is there a dictionary for all the lingo used here?
Are you taking about wsb elite? I was invited there and it‚Äôs really dead over there
How do you open that option
It's gone up 1000% in like four months. What more do you want?
How do I delete someone else‚Äôs comment
I‚Äôm curious how much influence,if any, WSB had on BB today. Coincidence that people were shilling BB yesterday and it popped over 20%?
Serious question plz. Does volume play a role in the short squeeze because people have been saying iti will last a week based on 6 million volume. Yesterday was 100 million. Serious question and I'm not melvin I'm retarded.
Hey everyone check out the new guy üòÇ
If my puts aren‚Äôt murdered by tomorrow morning, I will never be a bear again
üöÄ
This is the answer you‚Äôre looking for if you‚Äôre serious.
BRO, are you trolling or do you really not realize whats possible here? I see this to often, we are going to 100 absolute fucking minimum, we could see 500 on this. I'll tell you how you can tell if the short squeeze is over, if you see a day that involves multiple circuit breakers on the way up thats when it has started
WSJ is trash.
It's not, but companies measure losses on potential gains all the time. If you apply that same logic, then the bottom 90% of American has lost 50 trillion to the top 1% over the past 50 years.

Nicely done. For a minute there I thought I was actually watching the real show. Talent is pouring out of ya. Here's hoping my call makes it to ITM.
Burry was right about GME all along. Does that mean we short TSLA
Tesla really just shit the bed this week. Sorry elon, I‚Äôm out
So why is GME going to moon tomorrow because of the puts expiring? People exercising?
i'll sell one share just for the screenshot, then buy it back immediately
For what I looked up. They are not the first publicly traded PBC. Just first to transition to PBC while being publicly traded. Correct me if I am wrong.

My thoughts are they will be an initial drawback on the stock as we can has already started. But I don‚Äôt believe it will vastly change VEEV‚Äôs growth prospects much. The stock will prob stabilize again after a while. 

This will help draw ESG investors I think. It may lose some investors. Not totally sure.

Since this is a long term hold for me, I will prob look to add more as it drops a little.
Because of iv... Mornings tend to have high iv especially as the stock is pointing straight up lol

Someone called in and asked about Ballard. Cramer said he is PLUG guy, and he knows that it went down today because someone said something negative but Cramer thinks that person is mistaken

Hello. I have heard from a television host that I can get good investment advice in this reddit site. Now I thought I had been investing for 40 years until I retired, as I was depositing my savings into my brokerage account. I thought it was a managed account, but it turns out I should have been selecting the stocks to buy the whole time. Now I have this cash which is not invested in anything, I think about $4 million. I would like to invest and I was thinking perhaps coca cola or sears. What would you advise me to invest in? Thank you.

I don't want to be THAT guy, but please pay back that loan ASAP. I'm not saying you're about to lose everything but shit happens and you don't want an outstanding loan under your name that you can't pay back. Especially if you're about to get a bigger loan (the mortgage).
Maybe limited risk was unclear. I want some, just less than weeklys/monthly‚Äôs haha

because you might think that it is going to break out and run up if it hits a price. if something is in a range say 100 - 110, you might set a stop at 115, so that if it breaks out of the 100 - 110 channel you can catch that run

Hey I appreciate that man, odd to see that kind of kindness around here. I can't complain too much I suppose because really I'm only down $600. Initially I put in 900, made 6k, and got way too cocky Friday on tsla and now I have 300 lmao. Just blows to think I made enough to pay off a fair bit of debt and then lost it within this week because I was too hopeful and didn't want to take a 2k loss so I let it ride until it was almost worthless

Oh fuck yeah that‚Äôs the next wave I guarantee it

Nah you still leave yourself some play money.  Like a mil.  With that you don‚Äôt need to make stupid moves to make good money.  10% trade gives you 100k.  Buy shares of anything now and you have 10% within months, maybe days.

WSB should go private for a day and fuck up the boomers hoarding here lol.
From what I understand as long as you can cover you don‚Äôt need to close your positions and can theoretically wait it out. You just get wrecked by premiums etc. the higher the price goes however, obviously the more pressure. You need to have DEEP pockets to hold out. I think when the first big short gets margin called, there might be a feedback loop jolting things higher and higher
Based on your username alone. I'm out.
Yeah everyone in here should have calls on c o i n  stocks. Got some on the dip
It's not what I think.  It's what an entire team of actuaries and number nerds think, plus a couple of supercomputers that crunched months of data from the sub.

ive never bought stocks before ever in my life and i have $110,000 saved up to play with. I'm seeing people say GME but even if it goes from $42 to $80, that doesn't seem like a bigger gain than buying BB which is at $10.62.   


Should I go all in on BB?  
Also, what are taxes like for this? Taxes are only on the profit?

It's just not helpful. Yes, could've done better with indexes, yes, indexing is the new zeitgeist. It's just not useful to be the 10 millionth person saying 'indexes good'. The gates example is obviously just pointing out that doing better in an index is not in itself an end if you have other motivations. A great deal of people failing at trading is not understanding what they're doing and not taking the time to learn. The guy was just sharing that he'd done so. But yes, indexes yadda yadda.

So is this a scheme to just take advantage of the short squeeze or is it also a bet on the company reinventing themselves and being worth the new price?

Like, is it going to drop like a rock after the squeeze or will it still settle at a higher valuation post-squeeze?
Nah he's woke

Did you ever hear the tragedy of u/analfarmer2 the unwise? I thought not.  It's not a story boomers would tell you. It's a WSB legend.  u/analfarmer2 was a WSB God, so powerful and so wise he could create 700k in a week. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was not seeing a mil in his account, which eventually, of course he lost. Unfortunately, he YOLO'd his remaining balance on $WEED stocks, his calls expiring worthless.  Ironic, he could bring laughter to others, but not himself.

Hey you want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money FRIENDS.
The period is the little dot at the end of the sentence. I call it a full stop. You don't need three.

I agree, you cannot use absence of data to claim something. That has been the core point all the way through. I'm glad you got there and hope you won't do it again.

I don't know why you're now talking about extrapolating from small data(sets) but, OK. I agree with that too.

It's very narrow form of globalisation of economy, where labour capital has seen virtually 0 globalisation, while corporate capital has seen huge globalisation. This results in corporations being able to exploit labour that is captured by states. Modern globalisation is in effect the destruction of the free labour market.

Again, high IQ. Are you suggesting buying individual shares? Can you even do that on Robinhood? I can call my Schwab broker, working out of his boomer retirement home, but I don‚Äôt know how reliable his dial-up is.
While this sounds great, I have a feeling unemployment will increase and more small businesses will close. $15 an hour more than doubles current labor costs. 

Additionally, the cost of living will increase at least the same percentage. 

Both of those things have happened every time the fed raised minimum wage.

Great data

I did a similar experiment but less extensive and detailed. I used the trending stock website to invest in 2-3stocks a day. Made really nice profit on CLWD (160%), and IONI (120%). The difference is that I sold it all. Both of these were extremely well-timed (almost lucky exits, as both dipped hard)

On the other hand I am even on $TLSS (plan to hold after today's dip), after being 100% (I did a mistake not to sell after the hip), and doing pretty bad with $OZSC. Overall about 30% profit in a few day. No complaints.

However, I am new to day-trading and penny stocks, so still learning.  

Will use this thread to thank all the people contributing here.

I have been setting it for 48 hours. Since I have purchased nearly all of the top 15, I catch some that have already spiked, ZOM, CTRM, but at the very bottom, I picked up MGTI, EMBI, and IONI which have made decent gains.
Yes
I agree with your sentiment here. That said throwing it all into tech certainly isn‚Äôt the answer either. I have Apple, Intel, and several others so I definitely have tech exposure (you have to right?!?). I just think that there‚Äôs a decent chance with the new administration that weed stocks are going to run.  Think about it as ‚Äúhigh‚Äù-versification.
Could you elaborate, please?

I plan to sell at open, after hoping for another AH/pre-market pump. They were about 100% up at the end of the day. I‚Äôm not risking holding throughout the last day. I couldn‚Äôt find IV data, but I assume it‚Äôs >200% and I didn‚Äôt think they would get crushed over night.

I really wish they would quit pushing "Biden's 2K stimulus checks" when in reality it's for a $1400, because the $600 was a Trump plan. I have a feeling people that don't pay close attention are going to be pissed when the amount isn't the 2K they were expecting.

While I am looking forward to my check, I do find his handling of small business relief to be racist and despicable. In the CNN piece I read, he is prioritizing minority owned businesses. If the money runs out, tough shit Whitey, you should have been born with a different skin tone.

This is pretty impressive. I initially thought your methodology meant you'd be buying stocks that have already been pumped, but it looks like you're doing well on this. Looks like a Reddit pennystocks index fund might be a good idea.
It‚Äôs worth 2 billion right now. If weed is legalized, that‚Äôs a multi trillion industry. Anheiser Busch is worth 130 billion as we speak and margins on weed are wayyy better than beer. I get that we are 5 years away from actual weed shops being owned by a franchise, but this market runs on hope and future outlook. 

Therefor, my conservative estimate for year end for tilray is 100-130$. That‚Äôs if we keep getting legalization news and no one details that.

Dang, that's great!

My fav is always the accounts that you (for one reason or another) stop contributing to, and you can just see them grow.  When I moved to the USA I had to stop contributing to my Canadian retirement account, but I still have it so I get to just see it grow.  I only ever contributed $78k but it's now worth $160k.  That whole thing about investments doubling roughly every 7 years.  It's real.

On my net worth spreadsheet I keep track of the total cash I've contributed to each of my investment accounts so I can always compare the total investment to the total value.  It's a totally optional step, but I like it.  It's crazy how much you start to gain eventually just from market gains in a good year.  (Let's not talk about the bad years though!)

id say more in disbelief how its unfolding
Just a little perspective.. Ryan Cohen built Chewy from scratch.  It has a market cap of 47B today.  

And now...
He gets to start with a product that is more popular then fucking pet food.  He gets to start in an industry that is bigger then fucking pet food.  He gets to start with a company that already had $6B in sales last year.  He gets to start with branding that everyone knows. 
 He gets to start with a company that has a market cap of 1B but should be 10B.  He gets to start with 55 million Power Up members.  He gets to start with a company that already has an ecommerce presence.  

How much are shares worth if the company has a 10B market cap? ~$140 per share.

How much are shares worth if the company has a 47B market cap?  ~$670 per share.

TLDR: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Definitely. The primary motivations for me for FIRE is

1. Being able to spend more time with my kids
2. Having more time to travel
3. Being able to move to a LoC living area without being worried about the wages there
4. Being able to pursue areas that interest me, where I don't currently have the energy to do.

Some of the areas in #4 may involve getting some salary, but I don't want to depend on it. For instance, I really enjoy woodworking, but I don't currently have enough space to do so. Even if I did, I'm not sure I would have the spare energy do exercise this hobby much. Maybe in the future I will sell some of the furniture I build, but I don't expect this to get much income.

I also enjoy coding & game development. I ended up working outside of game dev because it is a huge grind compared to other software jobs, but I'd love to develop some indie game myself (or with a few partners).

Other then that, I'd love to volunteer teaching Math & Programming to kids. Maybe this would be a paid position, but the beauty of FI is that it doesn't have to.

Working in RE is a very interesting proposition, because even a low salary makes a huge difference when it comes to the amount of extra money you have. Even a low salary like $10 an hour, 20 hours per week adds up to about $10k a year. When all your regular expenses are taken care of by your nest egg, an extra 10k buys a lot of extra gadgets. You just have to be careful not to let your lifestyle inflate to the point where you \*need\* that extra 10k
is there no point buying tomorrow then?

It‚Äôs not at the station at all. There are still so many positions to be covered.

They had too many stores. They are closing unprofitable stores which means they stop losing money. The stores that are profitable do pretty well. They are also shifting to better e-commerce sales. Overall the company is growing now.

In the same boat as you, king. Going to be watching it like a hawk tomorrow, and try and take profits while not being too greedy.
I mean passing out because of an infection seems pretty severe. They assumed what I had was mild until they did an X-ray.
Thanks bro. I'll prob go this route next time. Some people suggested Ark funds so that's prob the go.

Right now my quality of lifes gone up a lot. It's a lot better to not be checking the markets all the time and finding a play. I think i'll also be glad to be back though.
Yeah and that would basically ban them from trading in the US right? But would that effect Tencent in their company shares in US companies?
For example Tencent owns Riot Games, would the blacklist effect that in anyway?
>	problem is, the US is behind on vaccines and has messed up numbers due to doctors taking time off over christmas. 

You have a source for this statement? This is the silliest thing I‚Äôve read on the internet today. I work in healthcare, and doctors and other workers work more now than the years before.

$FDX: $8B EBITDA, $74B revs, will have record hauls this next quarter due to stay at home black friday and Xmas, and oh yeah FDX is critical for covid vax distribution. 


Yet $DASH market cap = $FDX market cap. Makes total sense.  


Damn, FDX would be $1000+ a share of got a stupid multiple like $DASH.

Dude I swear I think TSLA is just fuckin up all metrics. The amount of volume in both shares and call options in TSLA alone is eclipsing ETFs across the board. 

I wish I could subtract TSLA from SPY/VOLD
Not sure how to answer that one
good thing about r/wsb is that most boomers will see the sub for the first time, looking for trading information as described by Cramer but only see memes, movie-edit gifs, and lots of talks about diamond dicks, hands, autism, a lot of love triangles with boyfriends fucking wives and leave the site, thinking they had a typo. That's how they end up in r/stocks eventually
Lmao those would of been worth 1800% today.
Great picks. Stick with them. Although I also like crowdstrike as the other guy mentioned. I wouldn‚Äôt touch pton at this level though

AMD re-entered the server market 3.5+ years ago. For 1.5 years AMD has absolutely annihilated Intel in the server space in performance, efficiency and cost, and it's mostly a drop in replacement for Intel. Market share is still just a touch over 10%, and expected to take at least another year to hit 20%.

Sure AMD can go from mostly irrelevant to a small but significant amount in a couple years, but to suggest that they're realistically going to challenge Nvidia in that space in the next 4 years in terms of market share is super premature.

I bought $500 worth of GME shares for luls and to help out. Even if the stock went up to 80 I would make like $80. Considering how much I have it would be like Warren Buffet dropping 50 million for luls and to help out internet strangers. Crazy.

I guess that's fair. Technically, they were sued by the DOJ, but Visa said they were going to challenge it. After discussions internally and with Plaid, they decided to just drop the acquisition given the complex court process. 

I've read that after seeing these huge tech IPOs and SPACs, Plaid's investors and management may have seen the $5B as not as much as it could be and additionally pressured Visa to drop the challenge.
That is real beautiful

Good long-term bet too. Buy at open. It'll probably squeeze for a bit and then stabilize. So you can decide to go for short-term of you fancy it too. Cohen is at the helm so with any luck there'll be consistent growth over the next while.

This idiot has $44 2/19... the way shit goes parabolic nowadays why not.  But yeah.  It‚Äôs not working out so far.
Why BRK and not an index? I like the idea of BRK, but even Buffett seems like he'd recommend just going with the S&P 500.
Facebook‚Äôs market cap is at 700 billion and twitter only at 37 billion. It should say, facebook lost about 49 billion and twitter 2billion. Which are both less than 10% of their total marker value. This is misleading, they just had couple bad trading days. Stfu
Maybe leap puts and day trade the squeeze if so.

why did GME FADE SO MUCH AH
Mid Feb to be safe, going for 1.80 right now
I‚Äôm a little retarded but I think it‚Äôs basically everyone buying their call strike prices? So basically it‚Äôs a feedback loop with everyone buying their calls @ 55 and shorts trying to cover. Would make the stock go absolutely parabolic for a short about of time
Pretty much. Dems will control house/senate so unless one dem senator objects with some bullshit to get more $$$ or a rider from his constituents it should be quick and easy.
I bought two calls so far starting at 250 and 260! Will go all the way up to 300 if it starts printing
this sub has lowered my IQ by the same proportion its boosted my returns. 

fuck me, i caved and bought AH.
They already jumped from 80 to 120 in the last few months. But yea, definitely a great company, i have some shares in my boring boomer account.
Here‚Äôs the way I look at it using OP‚Äôs numbers.

If you are holding quality stocks (not some penny stock, meme, pump and dump shit) you could lose 25% of that portfolio and still be up over 50% since last March!! Incredible gains even after losing 25% from today‚Äôs prices.

BB BABY
its being shilled SO hard.  what could go wrong?
What option should I buy?
!Remind me 73 days
Hello sir, I'm sorry to hear that! 

Basically, IANASB, but you want to concentrate on buying 5 year puts on green energy, space travel and robotics. These fad industries are bound to crumble - going the way of the cursed adding machine, and the short-lived Tamagotchi! You'll be able to retire to a castle, or even buy as many rooves as you want!
BB will be your stronger bet if you're holding longer than 2 weeks (10 years, I see it at least x10), but we don't do that here.
Yeah he missed the point. He sees us pump ICLN and Tesla and thinks it‚Äôs cuz we care about the environment
Fuck it time to ride this üöÄ to the mf moooooooon
Should I just buy CRISPR shares and quite stressing over options?
Have you heard of "video games"? It's just like television except you can control the people on the screen. It's gonna be big. Right now the major seller of these "video games" is a chain of stores called GameStop, you know, a place where you can "stop" in and see all the new games in one place. I have been following the news related to this company and I am very confident that it will be a good long-term investment. The best part is, you only have to buy this one stock and not worry about checking on multiple different companies. I believe, if you act quickly, that your initial $4 million dollar investment could be with 8, 12, or even 20 million within a few years. Don't wait, this opportunity won't be around forever. If you need assistance opening a Robinhood account, just ask anyone in this group. They'll be happy to help you. Good luck friend!

Potential to secure partnerships with other companies which will be huge for them. Personally I really like their concept and think there's enough innovation for them to grow quite a bit. I'm gonna hold for a year probably
BB is your chance at redemption child.  Consume the berry.
$20
that‚Äôs a lot of B‚Äôs my B
IS BBBY still a buy on Friday?
WSB has become my new DD so why the fuck not!
Shouldve waited until earnings in Feb retard
Here
I bought 50 of the 12$c 1/22  just in case they wanna do EV
At this point does it matter?  We literally can't be more leveraged.  Who's gonna stop them long as the dollar still means something.
Lmao right there with you brother. Not down on my calls or shares yet but it would be nice to see some movement
They‚Äôre driving me fuckin‚Äô nuts over here chief. I gotta get rid of these fruitcakes.
DBVT (DBV Technologies) just got great FDA news. About to explode in next 6 months. Already up 75% after hours. Going to $25
I got in right when i posted that.   Close to $29 after hours.   This is looking good.
da fuck u talkin about retard
I‚Äôm the only retard pumping PENN. Feels bad man.
Not gonna lie I‚Äôm feeling super depressed I‚Äôve only had 200 shares of gme this entire time. 

Could have turned my entire 100k savings into what? 2 mil?
Ya I don't think this is going to end well
F
yea that motherfucker wears a helmet to bed
Nah, scalped in the morning off a small swing. Thought it would fade but then it didn't.. map here we are xD jumped back in.
If it goes up to 80 that‚Äôs almost double what it is now, you would make $500
Why not green energy?
Well enough to make you hold when you really should sell
booyah!
NIO can you fucking fly again, im regretting so hard to put my money in NIO and not GME
I would start turning a profit tbh
I made a good amount today, now my brother wants to give me 1k to play. What do I even do?
gonna try to jump on BB in the morning. Shares? or like a $15 call. both probably ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ok look at Best Buy for an equivalent evaluation then.  B&M does not, a company, destroy.  You can have physical locations and strong e-commerce and kill the game, speaking of which GAMING is such a huge market with so much upside in its own right
Love AMD and want all the best for em but TSMC not being able to meet demand for them is bad news for that needed growth(and a price much beyond 100)...intel having fabs makes meeting demand and much higher profit per (inferior) chip is a major headwind.  And if the new Intel CEO corrects the ships and starts producing superior chips the endless Intel/AMD cycle will continue....

Maybe or just go into GME for a yes
GME is still viable, lots of short interest thats gonna get decimated and calls that are gonna expire, everyone investing in BB now was just too scared of GME.
Maybe take some profits and hold the rest if you still like the co
If it's anything like the last few weeks, very boring
Stimmy hangover next week . Get dem poots
So I missed the buy for BB, am I going to miss out if I put an order in for the morning?
Inverse this for tendies
You made nothing until the moment you sell

I bought PLTR today, just shares though, hopefully get some money for calls soon. Thanks for helping my confirmation bias!

They are also short tons of shares. With their puts expiring OTM, they can‚Äôt exercise them to profit off their short positions, or to help cover them.  But they still have to cover the shares they borrowed.  Again, with the puts worthless they are underwater and will be forced to cover at higher and higher prices.

its an ETF. Biden isn't even in office yet. We still haven't rejoined the Paris Agreement (we will day 1 according to him) and were still expecting a massive stimulus.  Your shares will rise steadily and beautifully over a bit of time. it's not a pump and dump. ETFs never are

It's in part because the problem continually gets qorse, and thereforr it continues to make news.

> Do you have any idea how Glacier works?  I mean like physically? 

No, and they are intentionally vague about it.

> [This](https://www.itproportal.com/2013/11/09/one-of-techs-most-elusive-mysteries-the-secret-of-amazon-glacier/) guesses that it‚Äôs cabinets full of hard drives which‚Äîlook I‚Äôm not here to judge anyone clearly these people know what they‚Äôre doing‚Äîsounds like a 12 year old from 1993 designed.

I suppose so long as it works in the manner they say it does, it's as secure as they claim it is and they don't lose your data... it doesn't really matter at the end of the day.

For what it's worth I would imagine that the article is pretty close to the money, purely on the basis that there's not all that many ways that Glacier CAN work - the data has to go somewhere at the end of the day, and why would it need to be any more complicated than banks of cheap, suitably replicated commodity HDDs?

If physical storage is a problem then subject to regulatory provision, I don't see why they can't just periodically migrate older data out to offshore data centers where both land to build them and manpower to operate them is cheaper than in the US.

Amazon have their own fiber, so it's not like they have to pay anyone for transit and they probably have plenty capacity for archival operations in the small hours of the morning once people stop streaming content:

I've never traded RSI divergence, used to do a bit of OBV and CMF divergence trades in crypto a few years back though so I understand the concept.

I've never traded DXY either, but I wouldn't think an RSI divergence is enough to drive significant change in price with an asset that I imagine is driven by fundamentals so much.

If your mid term fundamental outlook on USD is bullish, then the technicals could definitely be a valid reason to get you into the trade, but if you expect that USD is going to continue to be devalued by US economic policy, then I wouldn't touch it.

My 2 cents for what little it's worth.

My estimation for a longer term fair value for GME is $40+. The squeeze might take it higher than that. There's going to be a ridiculous amount of volatility for a long time. I typically make most of my money on Theta, so I'm most comfortable with recommending buying shares and selling covered calls against them. However, I'm not doing that with this play...I'm just in this for the entertainment of the SQUEEZE.
I agree with that but he did indeed hate bonds, and you‚Äôre right on the well-researched but there comes a line where well-researched speculation becomes investing for sure. I suppose unless you know everything about a company and you suspect that they will take over the market in their specific field I guess, I agree with you.

ok so in this example you don't want to buy in the 100-110 range because it might drop below? so you wait for it to make a move first?
This sub does more arguing over what the best investment strategy is than talking about tickers haha. Which I mean, I guess may be the point of the sub but its kinda funny cause its the same types of posts.

Yeah it seems that way. I cant find anything about whether the fee ever changes except that the lender can always reclaim the stock. They usualy don't as long as the shorter is solvent.
I'm assuming this is causing the spike in volume AH?

Lol no it hasn‚Äôt.

But yeah, dare you to short during a short squeeze lol
Saw Monday was dipping 3% so I was about to buy some more shares... and I never got the opportunity. Ended up pulling trigger pre-market when it was up 10% and I‚Äôm glad I did.

Interesting idea, looking forward to see others‚Äô comments. The buy and hold strategy is always going to win in the long term, especially if you are DCAing along the way. Nothing bad about taking profits though, atleast on your initial investments.

This has been so steady, I‚Äôm up 100 percent over the past week and my calls expire next November I‚Äôm pretty hyped
This is amazing
I sold game at 17 (after buying at 16 something at it going down to 12) and BB at 5 (wasn‚Äôt moving like the others). I have mine a loads of places and I‚Äôve very little chargers and it‚Äôs mostly free unless I trade loads. So I get a lot of mooners - NIO SPCE and PLUG recently done me very well. I tried to do some pre covid that will climb back to March levels eventually, and then loads of different sectors because if one takes a hit the others pick up on that day. I only ever lose money after a good day which is fine and expected.
Split it 50/50 next time so at least you won‚Äôt lose out at least.

Also a lot of it is: I want to be able to eventually provide for my future family and have a nice house as my own place where I can weather the craziness that is out there. Retirement is fucked, society is changing and crime is going up, Chinese threatening democracy, free speech under attack, ...

I want to be able to purchase some peace, security and solitude for myself so I dont need to care/worry that much anymore.

Lol! He YOLO‚Äôd 100k a year ago.
just the Ah action lol.. was seeing gme drop a bit as bb rise
Well, yes. Any business should. They have services you pay just like spotify, that allows you to play music in your retail shop/restaurant/commercial establishment. They are using it a artists work in the course of earning their business. We're not talking huge sums of money here per business, those types of services aren't too expensive for businesses. 

Soundstr is not for these small little restaurants that just play some music in the ceiling speakers, or a clothing store, office, etc. Soundstr could be used by the service which provides the music to those small businesses to stream. Soundstr will inside of radio stations too, which it already is BTW and working with more that 99% accuracy according to the beta test results. Soundstr is for restaurants & bars with live stages, clubs, etc. 

The ultimate idea here is making sure royalties get into the right hands by making it affordable for businesses to be compliant and pay royalties. For bigger artists this isn't a huge problem.. but for the smaller acts, this will be world changing!
So a couple $285c 1/28???

It's up to them. If they capitulate, they could go long on the squeeze to make money back. Or they continue to short at higher prices expecting a reversal at some point. Think of it like a dollar cost averaging for a shorted position. And there will be a reversal. Squeezes always collapse at some point. If you could short on the way back down, you would make a lot of money.

Your multileg contract should appear as one contract in the app. Select it and select the leg you want to close.

If you are changing the play, just always be sure to do it as part of a plan and not on the basis of emotion.

Yeah I mean if you can time the top riding this back down is going to be very profitable. I'm debating if I have the balls to do it myself, but if gme continues down this path I may just cash out everything except for what I started my account with and walk away once the squeeze is through.
They have a short position; essentially the borrowed shares from the broker to sell way back when that they need to pay back but were betting it would go down. So they may have short sold shares for $4/ea but now will need to pay $40/ea to obtain them cause they owe the broker
I hear ya, I had the same question yesterday.  Basically a lot of people smarter than me, looked at a bunch of indicators and determined most of the buying wasn‚Äôt by shorts.  


I checked out a solid 2% of what they said & it seems to hold up.  Lol 


General logic (for short sellers) is to not cover on the ‚Äúpeak‚Äù day of news (Cohen‚Äôs addition to the board).  So it makes sense most wouldn‚Äôt cover yesterday.  Plus, not everyone follows the news every minute or day.  


I‚Äôm off this week, but normally when I‚Äôm working I catch up on news after the markets close.  I know I‚Äôm not alone on that.  So I expect most people who would cover would not have had a chance to do so until today.  


On top of that, most people would not have gotten a margin call until today, so I doubt many were forced to cover yesterday.  


Just judging from people in this sub & not in this sub, there was a lot of FOMO, and a lot of selling and re-buying (that‚Äôs me, I did that).  So a lot of the volume seems to be Not shorts again.  They may be hoping to ride ‚Äúspike‚Äù out, but I think it was a triggering event and the pride can‚Äôt drop much due to all the people who need to buy.

It all depends on your situation.

Are you going to be adding money to it regularly as time goes on? If yes, there's a good chance these old investments will slowly become irrelevant as you add more money to the portfolio.

Are you going to generate huge taxable gains? Will a new/better investment do well enough to justify the tax bill?

I sold $49p a week ago and am honestly kind of hoping I get assigned tomorrow so I can ride it back up.
It's very important to remember that they changed the recipe in the late 90s.

They're still good but nothing like the old fried recipe.

My gut feeling is that you'll be like, "Hrmm...slightly oily saltine with tons of sodium and hint of chicken bullion. B- at best."

It could be a taste you only really love when it's mixed with nostalgia. Like Mt. Dew.

Now i have to scale back all my buys to like 50/100 shares at a time and try to be more mindful before I start going big again.

You buy the OPTION to purchase 100 shares at $15, and the cost to purchase that option is let's say $0.50 so you spent $50 total. 

The stock skyrockets to $20/share, and now the price of that option has increased as well. You sell it for $2 and make $200.

Had you just bought stocks, you'd buy 5 shares for $50 and sell them at $20 to make $100, doubling your investment. With the call option you risked less initial capital and quadrupled your investment.

So the reason it went from so high to low is share dilution and it will at some point be corrected with a reverse split
God I hope we pump tm :( Elon won't abandoned his children

Been trading options for 12 years, I know about MMs and delta hedging. I don‚Äôt understand how calls expiring or being exercised propels a stock higher. Any insight would be appreciated. üçª

He banged mine yesterday and I don't even have a wife
How do we know when the short squeeze starts/is over
That‚Äôs just buying and selling the option and yeah that‚Äôs right and you sell to close the option on Robinhood to do so. But options have a huge premium on them right now because of the volatility so the closer it gets to the expiration date on the option, the value either gets closer and closer to the strike price x100 if it‚Äôs in the money or to 0 if it‚Äôs out of the money. So if the shortest hold off the squeeze for a week you could lose everything on a 1/22 January call
Dude, im up another 7k today from GME. Why you got to ruin my vibe like that?

Im hoping so. I've got a decent bit saved already, so the next few months I'm rolling 30-40% of savings on cannabis, clean energy, and fuel/travel.

In reality, it could be(probably is) a big gamble.. but I'm young and if it pays off then it might pay a nice chunk of my future house. If not, oh well.

My RH year recap?
you look at short percentage
Predictions for tmrw:

Green energy mentioned briefly in Biden speech. ILCN stagnates, FCEL dumps with heavy volume of selling the news

AMZN rockets early morning then tanks to ~$3170 eod

GME finishes the day at $44

GIGA ends the day at $19

I end the day -9%
You serious? Lol
That‚Äôs the thing though. They can reclaim as soon as they aren‚Äôt. Meaning they need to be able to pay the current share price in the amount of shares the shorted. If a small player gets screwed and can‚Äôt anymore, then it could trigger. I remember seeing a while back someone writing that the average short price was $4 (this likely changed since then). But made sense seeing as how GME traded for years at that level. Imagine shorting x amount of shares at $4 and now it‚Äôs 10x higher in 2 days. Scary stuff.

Could you share your calculations ? Are you generating it with code ?
I'm doubtful. But we will see
Maybe Warren needs to get out of the house more. 

But seriously how can it be so rare to beat the S&P 500, when it just reflects the averaged returns of a large basket of companies? Roughly half of the companies in there would be expected to outperform the s&p, over any given period. 

99.9% can't beat the average return? Although this claim is often repeated, the math just doesn't check out to me. Any explanation is appreciated.

i've been collecting downvotes all day.  i said this morning once it hit over +20pct im loading up on puts.  even if i get burned i honestly don't care because i'm doing my part.  bb is absolutely the worst fucking stock of all time. their ceo is so fucking dogshit.  he sits around the office lighting money on fire all day while literally every other competitor that came 5 years later prints.  im praying for WSB on this one.
What do you mean?
Up right? Not into the ground?
Last week it did absolutely fantastic. If you're out after 1 week of red on an ETF then you just bought at the top. It's meant to be months of holding. Not one week.

Being able to get them isn't necessarily a good idea. If they are UK non-reporter/non-distributor status (many US ETFs are) then you are liable to pay income tax on gains at your marginal rate instead of capital gains tax. That's a real downer.

There are three oil-themed ETFs that I think are available to UK & EU investors which may interest you: SPOG is one ... also EXH1 and XSER.

There are also some investments trusts, if I remember right, BRCI? Not sure if it's still around. 

but TBH? just chucking it into RDSB/TOT/BP/XOM/CVX in 20% chunks is as good as an ETF anyway assuming you have a W8-BEN set up.

Remember to check reporting status. 

Finally as a UK investor you have the potential of a big tax advantage by splitting 50/50 BP & RDSB instead of an oil ETF. You will pay no dividend withholding tax (vs 15% USA, 26.5% France with Total, 15% on Irish ETFs holding US stocks (hidden from you)).

Wrong bro. They‚Äôll need some on board. Facts.
ü§û
So let's say you will work for 20 years then at 50 you can retire  if you start now by putting ‚Ç¨1000 pcm into the etfs and stocks I would guess your going to get 10% roi  that will give you a lump sum of ‚Ç¨730,000 From this money you can take 5% a year income so ‚Ç¨3000 a month ever month for life and your ‚Ç¨730,000 should stay intact  on top of the ‚Ç¨3,000 You will have any work pension I would guess that the total would go up at government pension age (67)  to ‚Ç¨4000 per month this should give you a nice life in a cheap county like southern Italy  

 if you are happy to work and save for 10 more years till you are 60 you will have  about ‚Ç¨2,100,000 this will give you ‚Ç¨8750 a month + other work and government pensions  == ‚Ç¨10,000 a month that's sweet  and can be done from etfs reits and some solid dividend stocks  or  you could just buy a vanguard s&p 500 and sell the rest of your holdings as the roi will be very similar.

A 2nd  plan is to dump the etfs and buy 100% growth stocks  for the next 10 years to build a lot of cash up 

If you bought a stock like tattooed chef or Callaway golf  you could get a 20% a year roi   so if you invest ‚Ç¨5000 today then  ‚Ç¨1,000 every month and can find a 20% roi for the next 10 years you will have ‚Ç¨375,000 at 40years old at this stage you could start buying dividend stocks with dividends of about 4% + 7% growth  you reinvest the dividends + pay in the ‚Ç¨1,000 ever month  and at 50 years old you will have ‚Ç¨1,277,000 or ‚Ç¨5,300 per month work till 60 and you will have ‚Ç¨3,800,000 or ‚Ç¨16,000 + work pension + government  pension ‚Ç¨20,000 per month 

So your looking at a monthly income when you retire of somewhere between ‚Ç¨3000 And ‚Ç¨20,000 a month 

As you can see its a nice to go for growth stocks to build up a big amount and get ‚Ç¨20,000 a month or even retire at a younger age on ‚Ç¨10,000 

You told me not to roast you so please take this as nicely as you can 

you don't need a ETFs that your age get some growth going so you can build a decent portfolio fast you got to take a little bit of risk imo 

I haven't even looked at your ETFs but they're going to return about 10% imo that sucks dew to your young age 

All them stocks suck as well have you seen how much debt they've got compared to income Enbridge is a great stock, with a nice dividend the sweating struggling to men saying it but they are maintaining it is a perfect stock for a 70 year old to hold not a 29 year old,  there going to have  a hard life.  And so are you if you hold that  the same goes for Imperial tobacco  everybody else in the market is buying clean energy  and your buying this lot that sucks imo 

If you give me your portfolio I would sell everything tomorrow at market open  except j&j I would hold that for the next 6 months as they will do well this year 

I would then  hold cash ‚Ç¨3000  and invest the other ‚Ç¨9,000 into 4 good quality growth stocks with market caps between 1 and 10 million  that can bring me 20% roi a year  I would buy tattooed chef  Walgreens and plug  and Callaway golf then add ‚Ç¨1000 a month and go for a ‚Ç¨2,000,000 pension and retire early at 50 on ‚Ç¨8,000 a month 

All the above is an example it dose not take into account tax but I stand by this as very posibull to achieve  

Also for anyone that says 5% Is not possible and 3% or 4% is more realistic I don't expect that as the  4% rule has recently been updated to 5% by its creator he stated that he was too harsh in the face place with a 4% Rule and 5% is more appropriate

Given that so mu h of my income goes towards housing, transportation and just general basic living expenses, in a lot of ways I also suspect on top of the 4 decades of Stagnant wages, we're also overall paying a higher effective tax rate. Where the idle rich can rake in $, sit on their butts AND pay lower taxes and hire an army of tax attorneys/lawyers/politicians/lobbyists so comparitively they're getting a free ride.

Love these write-ups! Keep it up and thanks!
 BIDEN IS PRINTING MONEY HE SAID U GET MONEY FOR HAVING LOTS OF KIDS. BULLISH
Yes! Got to put some into that one. This is the way.
Regardless, if I read correctly, a market cap of $4B would be like $60/share. They have over $1B in revenue last quarter. It's undervalued even at $60 now that Cohen has 3 board seats.
What's your youtube?
Wow. Gme put contracts about $100 more than calls at equal price.
Pretty much.  It will vary based on the brokerage - some brokerages have slightly different rates, some require interest payments daily, some let it accrue and then compound the interest.  


Either way,  it‚Äôs gonna hurt & it‚Äôs gonna hurt worse fast.  They are literally looking at the potential for profit going to zero (if it‚Äôs not there already). 


Lastly, they can‚Äôt just short more shares, cause that will drive the interest rate up & there aren‚Äôt more shares to borrow.  Screwed either way.

VW is nothing like GME. VW was an infinity squeeze driven by the fact that short sellers were shorting shares while porsche was accumulating them effectively reducing the public float.
No problem! And that's totally understandable, always put your money where your comfortable. I did so much research before investing in NIO.
We need enough ownership to get a seat on the board.

Dumped ICLN bought more GME, money is better than no money imo
Why
No, but trying to give good advice is. You'd have to be absolutely braindead to not sell any of it. I'm commenting for 0.1% chance that you're not a troll and actually mean this.

You've made a stupid amount of money, but it's not *yours* until it's actually in your bank account, and no matter how confident you are you can never be completely sure that the stock will keep rising. For all you know you could lose it all tomorrow because Elon accidentally detonates a bomb in the factory and kills himself with it.

That's unlikely to happen, but the point is that you never know. Lesson 1 of gambling is to quit when you're ahead. Sell half or even a quarter of it and you protect yourself from any risk while still keeping a large amount invested.
Either that or community college. I went to a state school and commuted and it was still 16k per year

Lol. DPZ is a health stock because they reduce the amount of cheese available for consumption.
I was of similar thought prior to recently. The narrative has changed though. This isn't about CenturyLink. It's about their fiber assets and Level 3 business. The traditional ISP business is paying the debt, dividend and providing cash flow for them to grow the more enticing side of the business.

Cheap debt and a market looking for the next play provides the setup to send this stock much higher.

Take a look at my last post.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm never touching PLTR again.‚Äù - an autist
I think this is the next boomer stock to print
Anyone know why Biden thinks now is a good time for raising the minimum wage when we have record unemployment?
That's two different things, people just buying shit because they see it in the news, and stonks going up because of money printing
gonna explode from fluff
anyone got a link to the buyden stimmy speech
Agreed. MarketMakers hedging will create an endless feedback loop up, until it doesn‚Äôt...
Yeah no this makes no sense. All ps5 are sold out as is and any new stock is immediately sold. And if you're refering to scalpers $1200 consoles, that's third party also makes no sense.
Why BB?
No masks... a much better time

Yo can I borrow twenty bucks
Why is the stock going up now? I saw the DD a month or so ago, and bought a share to see what happens. Q4 earnings come and go, the stock is going down, and I sold at a loss. Is there a specific piece of news causing this, or just people waking up to the facts we‚Äôve known for awhile?
I'm still debating to put $50 on GME...
I got 13 51c 1/22. This is my yolo

You son of a bitch you've earned all the praise.
The plan was to launch them Q4 2020, which has obviously come and gone at this point. With such a dramatic end of the year can you blame anyone for not getting things done? 

That said, its expected to launch any day. Many people seem to believe that funding round being completed will be announced just after a share buyback is quietly completed so they can have the biggest impact with the buyback move, buying up more shares and ultimately making the run go up higher!! Then they will probably right away announce the launch of the 450 units. Making for a dash to dollar land!

\*\*please note, all my opinion based on known facts out there\*\*
I just assume 90% of the people there have a net worth under 500k.

To be fair most of the people here who make posts like ‚Äúhow to invest 1MM‚Äù are also probably worth $80 at best.
2/5 15c that‚Äôs gonna be the play in the morning
after their last earnings, I'm not touching that with a 10 foot pole
Do it
Dude no, this shit isn‚Äôt even the full squeeze yet. And tomorrow not all shorts get covered. Just Melvin. We hold until all the shorts are covered then this thing really rockets. 200 easy.
Dude this market is once in a lifetime, but $TAN and just stop worrying about it. TAN will see at least 100% gains this year. I buy individual green energy stocks (ENPH and IEA mostly), but you can just buy the etf and not even think about it.
AMD, like Apple, hold an ARM Architecture License, which is the big boy-"do what you want"-license similar to their x86 license, not the peasant "pay money to ARM/Nvidia for every Chip sold"-license. And they are apparently working on some ARM stuff, rumor has it together with Microsoft, but thats only a rumor.
I didn't catch this other one, I just joined like 2 days ago
I‚Äôll go ahead and ride this with GME - to the moon/front page and beyond.
Buy the dip
$20k deep in options. 5/19 48C 
Someone posted they were over $1 million deep in PLTR recently and another posted $200k deep.
Yup Chinese shit is too dangerous to play for long
PLEASE SELL EVERYTHING AND RETIRE
ü§Ø genius
It will go up so high and fast that a 20% correction won‚Äôt even make you feel concerned. Go back up 10% then start dropping again.
But what about Burry‚Äôs Tesla shorts?
Yes, but often they attach a lot of pro big business bailouts to these bills. Do we have all the info yet?
Based on [this article](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/13/amd-ceo-says-apples-m1-chip-is-opportunity-to-innovate-underscores-ongoing-graphics-partnership) it seems like Apple will continue to use AMD for discrete graphics. The GPU on the new M1 chips seems to be [roughly equivalent to that of a low tier mobile Nvidia/AMD GPU](https://www.techradar.com/news/apples-m1-chip-can-apparently-outperform-some-amd-and-nvidia-graphics-cards).
It was, however the price hasn‚Äôt really been affected that much. It‚Äôs just trading in a range right now.
Chad PLTR crew checking in
imagine talking shit and giving up on ICLN a green energy ETF before Biden has even entered office and before he's reentered the USA back into the Paris Agreement (which he promised he'd do Day 1) and before he introduces his 3 TRILLION with a T dollar infrastructure plan.

I reject the whole Tesla is the underdog story. I‚Äôve spent my entire life supporting underdogs in countless areas; Tesla is a messed up company ran by a messed up individual since day one. The way they‚Äôve attached their underdog image along with their narrative, while the stock corruptly shoots up to unfathomable levels and they overtake the entire car industry turns my stomach. They are not qualified to be industry leaders and also do not deserve it. 

Again to my original point, yes the other car manufacturers aren‚Äôt perfect, but they all have a long history of safety recalls no matter how much it sucks to do a recall, they all have a long track record of doing them. To act like Tesla is the good guy in this arena and all other car companies are subpar is laughable.

Even beyond the recalls, if you want to talk about life threatening scenarios, Tesla absolutely takes the cake by misleading consumers with their ‚Äòfull self driving‚Äô technology. They prematurely were telling people ‚Äúin the future you will be able to take a nap or read a book while driving, and the future is now‚Äù which was completely misleading and a ploy to sell cars. Even now, their full self driving technology is nowhere close to where it needs to be. There are countless stories of auto-pilot crashes that could have been avoided if the company was just honest about their tech from day one,
Same story w PLUG. üôÉ

not an options expert, though I hold 4/16 35Cs... 
Really up to you, but as it is with questions like 'is it too late', I always answer: it's only too late if the squeeze has been squoze.. and last time i checked, it hasn't yet... not specific advice though, just thinking out loud
If you think that's fucked I had NIO 10c leaps expiring in 2022 that I sold back when NIO was like 8 bucks.
Come out, Jonathan. Mama wants to pump
I have $30C and 60C that expire in 2022. I also have a bunch of $19cs that I got at $11 that expire tomorrow, and a bunch of low 20s for February. 100% of my account is in TLRY. I‚Äôve been closing strikes over the past week and moving them deeper because it hasn‚Äôt slowed in momentum and the merger will happen in a couple months so I plan to ride it for a while. I don‚Äôt have specific target but I‚Äôm very bullish

Paper trade
Supreme Court ruled on this. Yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theater not protected speech. Presumably, "I won the election, go stop them from counting the electors" isn't either.

Regardless. Twitter and Facebook are products. If we're still capitalists here, businesses should be allowed to determine what their products are used for. If Twitter doesn't want to be used as a communication tool to overthrow the government I'm on board.
I think cnbc had an article about the merger not happening, but gave no sources why.

It's a self-selection bias. As the stock rises all of those on GME keep shouting louder. When it drops, people dissapear and the meme dies (for the moment). The same thing just happened with PLTR, and earlier than that with TSLA. TSLA's disappointment was brutal after battery day. It took until now for people to come back to meme TSLA.

Look. Just my opinion but you‚Äôve already won. Don‚Äôt let perfect be the enemy of good. Maybe trim half your position to get back your investment plus some and let the others roll? Then if it runs from there, trim another 10% and so on until you‚Äôre out. 

But you won, try not to run past the finish line.

I live in a state where recreational marijuana is illegal and know many people who drive 2-3 hours to the neighboring state that has legal dispensaries and stock up and drive back home.
I sell a call. I don't cover. The stock price reaches the strike price. I cover. There is no risk of me losing money except if the price of the stock goes down. At which point i can sell. 

I sell a call, I don't cover. The call is really far. REALLY FAR. The stock price moves halfway to the strike, i get spooked. I buy.

A call goes into the money, it gets exercised, the person does not sell the stock back, they keep it. The price has gone up. 

A call goes into the money, it had ALREADY been covered, it gets exercises, the person sells it, the price goes down.

Multiple people cover before their strike is reached, they all cause the price to go up, this causes more people to have to cover. It's an infinite loop (tsla)

I sell a put, i want to buy but cant because I want to have the money if the put goes into the money, the put is now out of the money by a considerable margin, i now feel safe in buying the stock itself which i believe in (because i sold the put)

Earnings might be rough, but they‚Äôll bounce back. They‚Äôre going to go back up to pre-Covid highs within this next year most likely.

You could try to sell before earnings, but if you did that I‚Äôd suggest to buy back in after earnings. I would say minimum 30% gain this next year. Realistically I could see closer to 50% gain.

Maybe just buy some long term calls following earnings and forget about them.

Agreed! Thank you for the IONI DD. It followed the same pattern as CLWD ‚Äî peaking the following day. It pumped and then a lot of people dumped it the same day, but I‚Äôm happy I held on. It‚Äôs remained consistent at and holding in the .70s/.80s.  I think there may be another surge tomorrow but if not, might be good to hold. It was a good DD with projections at $2-4 if you don‚Äôt mind holding it.

Wow Biden is a worse speaker than Trump this is embarrassing.
Exactly. Also as small business owner he gets fucked on taxes, interest on loans, and the rising of conglomerates in all industries. Even in sewer and septic work we are facing it. So he sees this as him giving the middle finger to large institutions.
That was actually euthanasia
It's almost like he is a prophet (I realize these were the only Jan date available when he bought last year). I wonder if there was some serious coordination with knowing these calls were out in the wild? I don't know how to figure out how many open contracts exist for a specific strike/date.

 Why did WSB think slow-moving ETFs were gonna be the key to weekly tendies? It's a good bet but not for 30% daily returns.
I will once the squeeze fully starts. I want my gain porn to be sexy af. I‚Äôve made like 40k so far. But she hasn‚Äôt hit 100+ yet. And she will. That‚Äôs when my gain porn gets let loose.

1. Massive short interest(60% at one point)
2. They acquire betting software
3. They beat projected revenue
4. They get multiple prices target upgrades

Seriously why is this stock invisible here? There‚Äôs been heavy short action after the initial run up from the betting acquisition and yet it won‚Äôt stay down. These tendies are being cooked as we speak! üöÄüöÄüöÄüåï

Set a target price and exit half at that level. Let the rest run until the next Fibonacci level is reached and exit half after that. And so forth. 

So far $50 is the reasonable level to exit based on consensus view and $100 if you're greedy.

Is anyone based in the UK? If so what platform are you using for trading options? The only one I found that has options to trade is Plus500 but their range is very limited both in how far out they go and what they are offered on. Most other platforms I tried using are using CFDs (Trading 212, E-toro etc.) Any advice would be appreciated.

For many reasons, the main one being to keep greater ownership of the company. Or to give the impression of high worth and attractiveness. 

I don‚Äôt know the ins and outs of this specific case but when you see big swings like that then yes, the company has usually taken major action.

It dilutes your shares and investors hate that shit so this is usually coupled with a selloff. It‚Äôs like you had a pie sliced into 4 pieces and you own 1 slice of the pie. But now they add some more cuts to make the pie sliced into 8 pieces but you still own 1 slice of the pie.

Most people dont have $500 a week to gamble with. Jesus, how disconnected is this place from the rest of the planet?

Me personally I buy $1k to $2k of options every few months (maybe 3,sometimes 4 times a year), that's what I can afford to put into something this risky. But the idea that you can get rich fairly quickly from this is absurd. Sure, I've had some nice gains. But I've also had some big losses.

I would agree. The paper I linked is fairly limited in what it analyses as a wealth transfer.
You're being far too lenient, those people will be criticised for not pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, even those who don't get unfair advantages handed out to them.
I‚Äôm glad you see it too. When XOM dropped to like 35 on earnings, I posted that calls on them would be literal free money. I‚Äôm up around 100k on that trade in a little over a month.

Yeah the TARP bailout of ~$800bn was ridiculed by the public yet now we have $6.2 trillion of stimulus, plus another $1.9 trillion on the way.  Where's the outrage there?  Keeping rates low, CoV-2, and the Fed/Gov't stimulus has quintupled the inequality, which we've already seen in the markets, public and private.  This is only the beginning.

College education (and private K-12 education) costs have skyrocketed with PE companies buying out Pearson for example with the intent of extorting students via textbook costs.  The colleges/universities turned more towards a business model because they know government backed student loan lenders (Sallie Mae) will bail them out if a graduate defaults on their loan.  Plus universities need the newest technology, buildings, etc. to attract students.

Hes actually gonna get fcked hard. Heres the thing, if this was 2008 he would of won no doubt.

Investing has changed loads since then, dont listen to people when they say this is the same  bubble as the 90's or whenever. Think about it logically, and why people are buying and holding

Why is GME actually already at 40? It should be around $5 no? That fact that it even got to $20 is proof that meme stonks are powered hard by loyal followers. Its basically like an instagram account lmao. The more followers, the more support, and the more buys. If it goes down, people will buy more.

&#x200B;

Thats my understanding of Tsla at the moment, for sure though do your own research. This is just my conclusion I reached

Ok, ok. Borrowed shares at a shitty low price because they thought the price later would be *even* shittier. Then bought 1/15 16p thinking they could basically pay back the shares they borrowed at 4x profit or so.

We don't know how many shares they borrowed because they don't need to disclose that information. But we ***do*** know that they took out 54,000 16P. So assuming the short interest is ~half+ them, we can assume.... üåàüêª  r fuk?

I know everyone wants to be deepfuckingvalue but if your calls aren‚Äôt either deep itm or longer dated than one week take your fucking profits. No one here knows how long the squeeze will last or how high gme will go. Don‚Äôt be one of the retards in the coming weeks bitching in here how you didn‚Äôt take profits when you had the chance.

Yup. I audibly sigh every time someone mentions profits or p/e with a growth stock. Guess what? If you quit aggressively reinvesting in the business, profits suddenly explode! Who would‚Äôve thought! Idiots.

I mean yeah but those are also more expensive so you gotta balance it. Ideally you buy it before it starts doing good (having high volatility) so you can buy more for cheaper but it‚Äôs past that now which is why people are advising shares right now. Yolo if you wish tho, if there was ever a time to do it it‚Äôs now. I‚Äôm already in with good gains but I might double down tomorrow as well
Stonks only go up
Thank you! Yo people talking shit on here about ICLN are driving me insane. The guy isn't even in office yet and people expect it to skyrocket. Give the thing a god damn chance.
Nope.  Buy GME.  Scream it from the rooftops.  14 year olds should be downloading RH and buying GME shares.
Don‚Äôt panic sell!!! Can you set notifications on the brokerage app you use? You‚Äôll have a heart attack if you‚Äôre checking every few minutes or every few hours! 

And as others have said, you can‚Äôt lose money if you don‚Äôt sell, lol.
Someone please tell me what to do. I really don't want to miss this trip to the moon.
We actually fkn do though
Whoosh
I made this mistake.
Many thanks from Germoney my friends!
No doubt WSB is Cramer‚Äôs homepage
what you got?
Fuck going to college mate, become a day trader
Warm
yeah. i really need to avoid looking at my portfolio and what it used to be/could‚Äôve been cuz it‚Äôs all in the past now. makes me wanna make as much as possible on every trade and i end up losing money for it. missed a lot of gains this week from selling early and they‚Äôve been making me feel like i gotta make it all back. thought i could start upping the contracts when i made a lot of money and got clapped back to where i started after 3-4 decent losses. thanks for the advice. really need to start thinking before fomoing in and using my emotions
Did you get out of your PLTR yolo for this? 

I was following that lol
The math says it can go much higher. Like absurdly high. The stock is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in recent history. The major institutional short sellers have been so idiotically greedy that they‚Äôve shorted too many shares for all of them to actually cover. This creates a scenario in which a mega short squeeze can occur, meaning a self-reinforcing cycle of the stock price shooting up, the shorts losing massive amounts on their positions and being forced to buy shares on the market to cover their short positions, which further ramps up the price. It‚Äôs a snowball effect. And it hasn‚Äôt even really started yet with GME. The institutions‚Äô response today was to try to *short it even more*. And even with that, the stock went up substantially. There are very few shares available now for shorting so they will have fewer ways to artificially force the price down. Plus tomorrow is the monthly option expiration and there are a ton of puts outstanding that will now expire worthless; the vast majority of these are held by the same institutional short sellers. They‚Äôve been shorting GME for years, profiting hugely trying to force the company into bankruptcy.
Plz tell me my plug FD‚Äôs are safe
Just don‚Äôt hold it with the hope it goes back up. If you believe in the company and did your research, hold it. If you‚Äôre only hoping for it to go back up because you‚Äôre red, take your losses and continue. 

It‚Äôs better to lose 10% now then 30% in the long run.

Lesson learned. Believe me all have had lessons like this. My first rule in stocks (especially day trading) control your losses. Also don‚Äôt keep watching it after you sold your loss because you‚Äôll feel bad and will trade with your emotion instead of your knowledge.
I need a hug, I have some shit that expires worthless.
You deleted it
The question really is. Where is jack ma?
You know what they say the blacker the berry the sweeter the fruit. $bb 25 eow confirmed.
Yay i made 100k on gme.

What do you think of this guy bearish dd for tomorrow [link ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis_of_massive_potential_gme_forced_selling/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
Sir this is a glory hole
Man this is lowkey fire if the calls don't work out, you put this shit on Spotify and get some of yo money back.
You can resell the option contract and keep all the profit from the stock value increase. (without buying stock)
New to reading charts so I hope this isn't a dumb question, it looks like it has the potential to be ~1.60 short term which would make a good selling point?
So what‚Äôs the move for BB? Thx pals

I‚Äôd be fine with it if it had raised steadily over the past week. Instead it‚Äôs been up to 34, down to 31, and struggled to stay above 32.50. I don‚Äôt need to to be at $50, just a firm $33.
I‚Äôve been hard way longer than 4 hours LFG KING
700 @ 8 but could have been so much lower :(
You buy a stock at $100 and sell at $200 you make $100. 

You short a stock at $200 and it goes down to $100, you make $100.

You buy a stock at $100 and it goes to $0 the most you can  lose is $100.

You short a stock at $100 and it gets pumped to $500 you lose  $400, and sometimes much more.

\^ That is a short squeeze.
You're exactly right
Man I have a 4 day weekend starting tonight
What is all this talk about a potential short squeeze with BB? Haven‚Äôt seen any DD on that. Then again I can‚Äôt read.
Please Gme hit 50 tomorrow I wanna make my first 1000
So I‚Äôm going to start to get into options üéâüéâüéâ  This is my practice run to get my feet wet. I‚Äôve done a decent amount of research but I still am confused with some of the more technical stuff. 

So I am using Robinhood and have bought: 

SENS $2 call 2/19 (my order is queued)

So to my novice understanding, I have the right to buy x100 SENS at my strike before 2/19

My two questions:

What is a limit price? There was one in there already, I believe .15 and I didn‚Äôt mess with it.

This is the reason I‚Äôm making the post, once I submitted the order Robinhood told me ‚Äúyour order will expire if unexecuted by 4 pm tommorow‚Äù. What would make this happen and I assume I get my $15 back if it expires?
narrator: of course he bought calls the next day, realizing that calls are not ‚Äútouching‚Äù the stock in the way that shares are. and he lived autistically ever after
Potential wise: ARKG or ARKX
I wouldn‚Äôt read anything negative into this. It makes sense as he is a director on the board from one of their large investors. They sold off some of the gain to rebalance their portfolio to their risk parameters as the quick Tendies moved their overall portfolio out of balance. They are still holding a ton of shares and this agree GME to the moon

Not a squeeze gain, but definitely gain porn worthy.  GameStop Director Kurt James Wolf [cashed out](https://newsfilter.io/articles/4-form---statement-of-changes-in-beneficial-ownership-of-securities---gamestop-corp-0001326380-issue-8e27294cee4d739196be9d85647f2ebf) 810,000 shares today for $17.2M.
Kurt Wolf is one of the directors currently planned to stay on the new 9 man board. According to his filing he had to sell because his GME position was too big for his firm's guidelines or some shit.
Had the same problem with tesla. Currently still down 75% but coming back slowly thanks to some Theta fuckery and Aphria

How are you not making money in the biggest bull rally of all time. Last 4 years have been fucking straight up, especially with buying opportunities we have last March and April

Ackshually we have it all figure out
Makes sense. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they went through a SPAC. It‚Äôs all the hype nowadays
You‚Äôre not lying
Yes you are.
Most modern cars these days use silver so the demand is already there. I don‚Äôt doubt the demand will increase. The supply for silver should be enough in the short term so I don‚Äôt see a 3 month call being enough.

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/idtechex-explains-how-electric-vehicles-are-eliminating-rare-earths-301158962.html

In the report above, there are other rare-earth materials that are much more in demand and needed for the newer EV models. A lot of the supply is in China. I think these mines are probably going to be more of a need in demand and a stronger play than silver, but I‚Äôm prob wrong and f‚Äô it üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ$AG $HL $EXK $SSRM

My personal belief is that unmanipulated price of gamestop is 90 dollars. That's not hope that's based on the money they made last year. That's without a squeeze. In short, it's not too late.
Blood red
Still holding???
Yes, speak up my guy. Did you get on the tendie train or you mad you missed it?
On the other hand he does believe in future gains cause he kept the April calls. It is just tomorrow that could be tricky. I would say if you get any profit close the position immediately and convert profits to shares.
40 shares, 26/28/30c 3/19 üíéüôå

Squeeze hasn't even began retard. This is all fundamental growth and excitement for Cohen. You'll know when the squeeze begins because your sell limit of 694.20 will dissapear and you'll be loaded to the tits. Take the loss, buy the call back on a dip tomorrow.
TLDR
Biden is going to drive up on the stage in a Cybertruck.  TSLA moons.

> I was under the impression that the seller will not be assigned until the breakeven price is hit. 

Nobody knows or cares what your breakeven is.  The strike price is all that matters.  You will be assigned if your short position is in the money at expiration, and at risk of early assignment before expiration.  Once you open a position, you are tossed into a pool of contracts that are randomly matched upon exercise/assignment.

&#x200B;

> What happens if for example I'm selling a put at strike $18 with b/e $20 due to $2.00 premium and the stock is at $19 at expiry 

You need to take another look at your math.  If you sell an $18 put for $2 premium, your breakeven is $16, not $20.
We're holding til it hits over $100 bc that's exactly what will happen
Well 98% of this sub is retarded so that checks out

How many BB calls do you need for 100k tomororw
Leaps
If gme hits $1000 I'll eat my socks, I will also be very rich.
At some point you gotta rip the bandaid off basically.
If in the money: you either exercise and buy 100 shares at that strike price or you sell the call and make some cash

If not: your call expires worthless and your money is gone

stupid question, why was he never in risk being assigned those calls that are that deep itm. isn't there like rule that 20 percent of calls get assigned? also being that deep ITM who would even buy them once he did sell to close. when he bought $40K worth of calls doesn't he have to have margin to be able to cover 100K shares?
You have a price target?

Let‚Äôs get something clear. BB is not in the autonomous software industry. That isn‚Äôt their business. They are the backbone of the autonomous software industry. The leaders of the autonomous driving industry use blackberrys software to build their autonomous systems.
Is this actually him?
Source:  Privately commissioned study that took all this into account and also scraped various other social media platforms to understand the full engagement and reach of WSB in particular.  If you want a copy of it, you'd have to help pay for it.

At the end of the day, this data is just an interesting science experiment to a normie retail investor.  It's something they can look at and puff out their chest on a little.  It's useful for people like me because it is another tool in the box to do trend analysis (and the result of that study got me 100% out of the short game of any stock that had even a 40% short interest).

I listened to the whole thing and let me tell you... that was legendary!
Doesn‚Äôt always make them wrong though. Tesla might not be making killer gains but it‚Äôs still up insane returns the father back you got in. PLTR is stagnant but it‚Äôs up for a lot of early holders, I got in at 15 and have held through out because I think it‚Äôs got potential to go up again. GME gang has been loud for a loooooong time. And they‚Äôre being proven right so of course they‚Äôre celebrating. But GME gang knows it‚Äôs only just begun so.
You just wanted short term gains and didn‚Äôt do DD on an ETF
I think you meant 100$.
I sold 100s of nio shares for $6 ü§°
Until $80 sound about right?
The puts expiring is just salt in the wound, and talked about because it's the only thing people can track. We can quantify how bad they're getting fucked here.

Shorted shares can not be traced back, but they reported that position themselves years back so we know they have one, just don't know how much. They will get margin called on this but nobody knows for sure how this will unfold.

Anyway take this and almost everything that's said in this sub with a grain of salt. But the fact that GME has doubled in 2 days and held while the only catalyst has been RC being appointed director strongly suggests whales are piling on for the same reason us retards are.

Tomorrow will be volatile.
If he sold 1 Million, imagine what he‚Äôs HOLDING üíé
Net worth ?
amazing.!!!!!....this is the next big winner... PLTR being held back & manipulated like crazy. XL also ready for reversal.

Also bought this rumor! It's a gamble, but one definitely worth taking in my opinion.
So excited knowing I‚Äôm gonna sell tesla tomorrow and get into BB
So the higher the percentage the better it is?
I'm thinking of some July calls, maybe $40. Idk

Sideways for more than a week loses interest around these parts. PLTR is going on 1.5 months of it. People get pissed when their pick holds em back from other plays rocketing. That is all. 


Next catalyst one way or another is either demo day or the lockup expiration in feb.

I'm not American. Your one-man 'happy China' party is adorable but not related to the thread at all. Actually it betrays your bias and explains the weird tangents before. Thanks.
You know shit's true when r/investing and r/wsb BOTH put a sell rating on the KIDS.

KIDS are 99.9% of the time poor investments that never pan out with any meaningful returns. A 18year+$500,000 investment on the SPY would net you a 10-20% annual gain. Even the worst boomer stocks like (T) would have netted you 50% equity + 18yrs of compounded 5-10% dividends.

Kids will cost you more that your initial investment since they'll require resources for upkeep, their high volatility will keep you up at night, and your first dividend payout after 5 year will probably a macaroni card. They are horrible investments. Trust me on this. I was one and I'd wouldn't recommend me.

Im looking to place my first options trade...I got $5k to drop. GME $30c for April?
885k shares were sold on Monday 1/12 at $19.99 and 90k shares sold yesterday at $31.08.   Those are already gobbled up.
anyone have link to bidens speech?
Limit sales set-

1,317 x 100 = $131,700
55 x 250 = $13,750
55 x 150 = $8,250
55 x 300 = $16,500
55 x 200 = $11,000

Total = $181,200

If it keeps going I‚Äôll back $100 price level up. $100 would be just fine tho IMO. Some say it will swing higher others say $50-60.... I found a good middle ground and watch it religiously and make adjustments as needed.

How much did you start with?
Damn. Yeah, there's a lot of ways to invest it. Fuck, just bung shares any of the last few years you could have over doubled that.

I started small with some shares of shit I liked, then starting toying with options. I just had to do it to learn it. Reading about it and watching videos didn't make any fucking sense to me.

I use about 15% of my portfolio on options and hold shares with the rest. Any time I double my option money, I either cash it out or buy shares with it. I learned that doubling down and getting cocky will fuck me over
Yea that‚Äôs just wrong. It‚Äôs good to keep a critical mind while learning/reading. Good catch.
Yes this is the DEFINITION of high risk high reward. With a price floor of $10 the potential for payout is too great to pass up.
the higher the percentage the bigger the squeeze
This is the most impressive thing I've seen on WSB.  TSLA plays got nothing on this. The fact that you build the position in 2019 and held to now.  I hope I can get to your level of conviction.

It was me being super emotional, I know OCGN and BNGO are solid investments to hold for the next month but when I saw the -500 from BNGO and -330 from OCGN, I got super scared and went into the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù mode and figured it would better to cut my losses then but as it turns out, if I had waited a few more days I wouldve easily been in the green and over 5k

Exactly. Bunch of impatient fuckers in this thread. This is a long-term play, clean energy is clearly part of Biden's policy ([https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)), and that the market understands the needs to pivot to renewables for future sustainability.

A lot of idiots here have been accustomed to instant gratification rather than long-term gain.

TD Ameritrade I think
Makes sense and to a large part I agree. The only quibble I would have is Weedmaps. It's actually a tech stock that makes its money from SaaS. It's not an actual cannabis play like Aphria. In full disclosure I own SSPK which is what will merge into Weedmaps when it goes public.
Dude, that sound proper retarded. Cohen and buddies have seats now, the party has only begun. Current valuation at .5 P/S. A shitty P/S like that assumes falling sales. If the new gang turns the rocketship around then expect an increase in sales and a P/S multiple expansion.
so... rockets or no?
Hopefully it was to buy GME at 20 cause that woulda been hella slick...
I am fellow mommy autist in training! Take my upvote you.
For every 100 shares of APHA you own you get \~84 shares of Tilray when the merger goes through in APHA's 2nd Q.  
84/100 = 84% Tilray current AH price 19.38 x .84 = 16.28 APHA should be trading at if you believe this keeps up and the deal goes through. APHA is. trading at 12.62 AH.
Well the thing about making his money is sure he can do that, but usually how it will work is for a stock to really increase there has to simply be more buyers. It's the same way these analysts by big banks work, while they will have an underperform rating for a few months, they are buying up the shares while people are selling. Once they raise the stock by their "forecast" a few months later there is an influx of buyers to buy up their shares while they sell. It's been like this since the beginning of the stock market. This is the extremely basic way of putting it but once you become experienced you listen more to your guts rather than people's opinions. For the past year there has been a sharp increase in novice investors thinking they can game the system. A few have been successful but those are isolated incidents where they 100% put their cash + margin into one stock and it went up. But for most people, that's not the case. These experienced traders have been playing this game for years and notice the sentiment of the market and right now the opposite happens instead of what it "should" be doing because they know the market works, they spend millions to study it, write algorithms (fun fact, close to 85% the market is algo trading). When this happens these novice investors get "paper hands" and realize a small loss when in reality the stock probably was down only for the first four hours of the day then goes back up. I know one in particular I saw going down but the sentiment in the market was that particular stock was going up the next day, well I saw a pattern, got out and saved myself from a disastrous loss. You only get this "sixth sense" or whatever you want to call it when you do something for a long time. So do small trades and learn from the victories and losses. You'll gain more doing this and save yourself so much money than listening to some guy telling you to spend money on him so you can make money. I'll leave you with this one thought, if it's too good to be true, it's too good to be true.
Here we go!

More likely it'll be:

Price goes down, you will say "ahh I'm so dumb why did I only sell 50%"
I‚Äôm going to keep it 100% real with you. Nothing that‚Äôs gonna be posted on this sub is a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù bet. Call options are incredibly risky because they‚Äôre leveraged by 100x.  I bought 50 call options for that strike price I gave you and it cost me about $3,000. I am well aware that I may lose that money and the option could expire worthless, but on the other hand if this stock shoots up like I think it will then I‚Äôll be up thousands of dollars. Buy shares if you‚Äôre not confident in the play you‚Äôll still make money on it, obviously not as much, but it‚Äôs less risky

I bought at 5 and sold at 10....
Go to my recent posts and you‚Äôll see it
I'm a fellow autist trying to learn but I'll give the explanation a try. Someone who has helped please my wife in bed will probably correct me but that's because they know what they're doing, unlike me. Also I'm going to use different numbers just for math purposes. 

Let's say your bullish short-term on a stock called SIMP. You have $1,000 you're looking to invest and SIMP is trading at $10. But, SIMP has calls only 3 months out with a strike price of $15 for $2. You can either buy 100 stock or 5 call options. (5 contracts * 100 shares * $2). 

Before calls expire the stock is trading at $20. Your calls are now trading at $12. Let's compare the profits. 

100 stock bought at $10 cost $1,000. You sold the 100 stock at $20 for $2,000. $2,000-1,000 = $1,000 profit. 

You purchased your call options for $2. They're now worth $12. $12 * 100 * 5 contracts = $6,000. You only spent $1,000 though so you've made $5,000. Your return now is 500%
Does that include my 2012 Honda Accord?

While true, they have bigger fish to fry. Just because creamer doesn't like us, doesn't mean we have substantial effect on the market. We've got a few billion going around \*at most\* and even then, it's much more likely to be a small fraction of that.

Just started investing. Gonna just put money in this and see where it goes!
im retired i guess, ive dedicate my time to ecommerce (runs itself with my setup) brings in $15k month, managing stocks and crypto which often brings in  $150k a DAY and so i spend most my time teaching and building my own youtube channel with my free time as my 'fun' job, philips money studio if ur interested :-)
They are doing ev they‚Äôve come out and said they will transition
Yup but then they had to switch studios and fuck it upüò≠

Thoughts on IPOE
I‚Äôve got 20 calls @.45 expire 7/16
Once the squeeze commences and GME lands on the moon it‚Äôs gonna be hard to go back to boring +5-10% days
We've all been there I did that with RDGL @.15 dip, and its now .25. The best thing for me, that I have learned, is to pause and think about why I chose the stock in the first place, before selling.
i truly advise you to put most of your money in an etf (ark etfs, icln, hell even spy when it dips). only leave behind a very small amount to start swing trading options (small enough so you won‚Äôt panic when losing all of it). the market is extremely volatile rn you can‚Äôt really predict anything. give yourself a nice 3-month learning before you decide to put more money into option, or even shares. 

The reason im saying this instead of ‚ÄúGME 69c 1/15 üöÄüöÄüöÄ‚Äù is because you‚Äôre a dad:) DON‚ÄôT LOSE YOUR FUCKIN‚Äô MONEY
Because calls are more fun
Yeah seems reasonable.  I think there‚Äôs a few flaws in the theory.  But even if that dude is right & 1/3 of float will be sold... well 140% of the float needs to be bought.  So who do you think is going to move the price more?  


Also, I‚Äôm buying more.  Lots of other people on this sub are buying more tomorrow, so consider a good portion of those shares already sold lol

Wait that's not a 10 bagger. I thought a 10 bagger was 10,000%
Not exactly. He doesn‚Äôt need bi-partisan support anymore, liberal policy makers control both houses of congress. Even though Senate is split 50-50, Harris is the tie breaker. That‚Äôs also why higher taxes in the future are certainty. 

Renewable energy spending will be put under ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù to help ‚Äúcreate new jobs,‚Äù similar to the New Deal. 

The bill also has to be big because monetary policy (brrrrrrr) is pushing inflation higher. The dollar is just not worth what it used to be, at home and abroad.

ICLN is at the launchpad, it's destination is to the moon but the journey will take a while because they'll be taking the scenic route. Just sit the fuck back, grab a drink and some snacks, maybe play $BB for a while or anything else that comes along the way. We'll be at the moon eventually. 

**You fucking degenerate pricks!!!!!**
You can buy both. I have both. My 10$ calls for 1/22 which I bought at .39 have doubled. I'm expecting the stock to go to 15$ EOM. The stock I've bought I will hold longer because the company has great fundamentals and is popping off in the software market.

This may scare some people and cause a little dip but it would just be a good buying opp. I still see bears talking about the store closings as if that is a bad thing when they will keep around 5000 open and only close under performers. They are just shedding liabilities. My company is doing the same thing and we will come out with more profits.

Where's Hunter??

Anyways ARKG calls been printing bigly.
Why is everyone talking about BB
Yes they do have unlimited potential losses in theory, but the max loss is basically limited to the market cap of the company. 

Say they shorted 100% of the shares when GME was worth 500M they might now have to rebuy those shares at a 500% loss since GameStop is worth 2.5B. 

Even if Melvin owned every single short share GME would need to go up another 8x to bankrupt them.
Launch delayed by weather, had to reschedule.
Had the expected numbers accounted for the end of seasonal jobs?  I would think that the beginning of the year always had a rise.
wtf was that zoom lmao
Is ICLN done? PLUG being it‚Äôs biggest holding got downgraded.

Hello, I talked to the Robinhood rep guy. He said there is no overnight margin requirement. Like if i were to hold Apple over multiple days, I only need 25% in cash even overnight. I just have to make sure I don't get below the margin maintenance level. Right now I have 75k in cash and using 60k in margin with margin maintenance of 45k. That means I can lose -30k/135k right, so I have 22% of buffer?

Taken from the ARKX SEC:

Federal spending delays the date the Fed has to halt QE due to running out of treasuries to buy. As long as QE continues, until the treasuries become exhausted and the Fed doesn‚Äôt announce it will start buying securities, we won‚Äôt have a recession this year.

Their yoy holiday App Store sales were over 30% higher.

Now that increase was not because people spent more on apps.  It‚Äôs more likely due to MORE people spending money on apps.  The most big spending happens when people get new devices (they often get gift cards with said devices when the device is a Christmas gift).


Also their servers were bogged down for a few days after Christmas ‚Äúdue to volume of activations‚Äù.  That‚Äôs a bullish sign if you ask me.  

In addition to that, the inventory and channel checks seem to indicate a 40% increase in phone sales.

In addition to the increased sales, their margins appear to be higher too.

In addition to increased Q1 sales, we all got a stimulus (and should be getting another one) & every time there‚Äôs a stimulus, people buy Apple products (look at apples increased sales during the last stimulus package - they beat forecasts).

And with talk about an Apple Car, people are giddy about the stock altogether.

So when they confirm increased sales & increased outlook for the year (that‚Äôs the big deal), Apple will shoot to $150 pretty quick.

In short, GME üöÄ üöÄ lol

APHA is now 12.11
Tilray is now 18.56

If I convert 1 APHA ($12.11) to 0.8381 Tilray at its current value = $15.55

That's more than 3 dollars gain per one APHA share

On a more serious note, looking through your comment history I see you've been doing finance longer than I've been alive, so you win lol. I have to ask, why are you bullish on PLTR?

Ok, you got me. Most of the runup was yesterday. Just topped off today.
Do you any of you guys know of a site that tracks stocks that JUST broke resistance? I use Chartmill but it only screens stocks that are near resistance, not broken it.
Would you recommend any calls if I go in tomorrow? If so what
Where can I watch the speech?
Hello my fellow retards. I just wanted to let you know I finally said screw it and took out a loan and bought itm gme call that expire 1/15 today.

Hey you want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing".

I‚Äôm not a CPA or a tax attorney, but an LLC shouldn‚Äôt really affect your taxes. Both an LLC and S-Corp run taxes through your individual taxes, so it would be the same as if you had no entity. The reasons to form one of those business entities mostly revolve more around protecting your personal assets from any potential legal liability, which is just as important as tax planning. So I‚Äôd suggest researching the advantages of each and deciding which one makes sense for your personal situation. I‚Äôd anticipate an LLC would make sense for most traders.

Gonna miss Trump's unscripted speeches
Honestly Biden livestreams gonna be so boring and on-topic compared to ü•≠ üçë 

Markets aren‚Äôt gonna rock like they use to
To be honest, I'm considering buying 100 shares of GME and selling 2/19 40c. When I looked earlier today, they were going for $9 each. *Nine fucking dollars.*
I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt suck. But The argument about tax is so dumb. 

Simple solution. If you don‚Äôt want to pay the tax dont earn the money. Yes I agree overly high taxes are theft. I encourage you minimize your tax exposure to the best of your ability and to vote for politicians that reflect your tax desires. Unfortunately this day and age it‚Äôs more of a pipe dream. 

In the meantime, It is what it is. I am not going to not work to earn 200k because I will have to pay 80,000$ in taxes. That still leaves me with 120k. Or I could not make the 200k and not pay 80k in taxes. 

Take it into account and it won‚Äôt be a 80k shock at the end of the year.

I relocated for work in 2019, and finally got all my prior home equity cashed out in Jan. It felt weird sitting on so much cash so of course I put it all in the market mid February. I think my pension rolled over into my 401k at the same time too now I think about. 

In March and April I was a little anxious and kept thinking about those risk tolerance questionnaires and reminding myself that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fully in the aggressive end of the continuum... let it ride!‚Äù It all worked out well in the end...so far.
I swear if stocks move this slow when Biden is gonna be president this will be long add 4 years...

A longer term reference for you: my portfolio around 1999 was: Boeing, AMD, Enron, and Cisco. Holding that hot mess until today would be, um, suboptimal I would say. Maybe 1.5 out of 4 worked out. At least there was no worldcom or pets.com...
BIDEN TALK ABOUT BB POTENTIAL!
Please say free iPads for the kids Joe. My apple calls need em

Biden just said the US government is going to work with GME to make America Great Again
How about $17 vxx calls?
That's the move I would make if I were to enter within a few weeks for a short to medium term theta play.

Front loading the investment would give the most time for compounding, but the market is hot. If you are uneasy about current valuations, you could put in less up front, and then increase your reoccurring investments. No one can be sure what will happen.

I'm no financial advisor, but with that amount, I would add some cash covered puts to the mix. If you were already going to dump it all in at once, you could at least get some juicy premiums selling barely OTM puts.
He‚Äôs got a roach burn lmaoooooo
my first investment was the day before the big gm deal then i got rocked by the report i was able to consolidate back down to around 17.30 currently per stock from about $40 previous
Spent all the stim money at the rippers
Haha you dont want my advice i am clueless, just got lucky after reading some of they guys on here.
The beginning of that saddens me, I had 200 PLUG at $4 and I sold at $8 thinking I did something amazing then it just kept going up to the now nearly $70 :(

USO was not designed to be a long term investment. 

Google the terms contango and negative roll yields to learn why. 

A really brief explanation is that the fund has to sell the expiring oil contracts before delivery and then purchase further dated contracts at a higher price. They are constantly selling low and buying high.

Melvin doesn't have puts expiring (maybe they do, but that's less important)- they have short positions they need to close. There's a massive difference here because while puts can expire worthless if the price goes too high, shorts (which means MC sold borrowed shares) still need to be closed. A higher stock price means the cost of the borrowed shares is higher and higher and higher, and this forces them to close their position.

While puts are likely going to expire worthless, that is secondary to the short squeeze.
I'm aware. Doesn't explain why OI is zero currently

GME n BB gang here üöÄ
Of that 0.1%...they‚Äôre on this sub helping grow their parents‚Äô retirement accounts or paying of their mortgages and roofs. Hope OP‚Äôs kid is part of that .1%
Cathy used to be an outsider but now she's almost a mainstream.  Her warning might be influenced by WallStreet since she gave that speech after her interview with Bloomberg.  

If you look at her buying/sell list in micro detail, she's been buying growth stocks rather than selling.  Always look out to what Feds say about rates and trade policy changes, those are probably the important key metrics for us retail investors to predict what will happen in short term.
Haha, OK. Will I make you happy if I buy some $45 calls. Which one do you have? I‚Äôll bid you up if it makes you happy. :)
God just get to the fucking point
no u
Any retards here hold or trade bonds? Bonds gang? That a thing lol?

Hey bro I‚Äôve been eyeing BBBY for a while now, I mig it buy some may calls. Do you think I should go with the 35c? Also, do you think I should wait for a dip or is it not worth waiting?
ngl Biden is such a boring speaker but I'm just here for the small chance he mentions green energy/infrastructure
Earnings coming soon. Should crush

But it's not [earned income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnedincome.asp) which is required for IRA contributions
Buying more GME shares for sure, definitely seeing another day coming up.
wtf? did Buyden just say that every American citizen is required to have a GameStop powerup pro membership?
my dumb-ass brokerage firm only allows me 50% over current market price. It's so idiotic.
Uhoh

Nice. I have been buying alpha the whole time expecting a good pump from merger. I have seen people saying buy alpha and then sell after the merger for quick gains.
The important thing is that none of this happens unless we control more SHARES.

My tard understanding is they‚Äôve been selling off a lot of patents and stacking cash. Plenty of speculation as to what that is - increasing their presence in IoT, auto industry and integration of autonomous vehicles, etc while focusing on data and cyber security. 

Plus stonks go up.
Oh fuck he fucking called out Wall Street.

 WALLSTREET! HE MENTIONED US!!
He cleared his throat
uh oh
The safest bet is just to hold the stonks.  I mean it's hardly exciting but it's still printing like https://brrrrrrr.com

Shit....idk this speech doesnt sound good so far
cooo coo. cause i bought $15k worth a few days ago accidentally. by accidentally i mean i thought i was buying apha, but im too dyslectic to know the difference. now im hoping i make better returns here.
He knows!!!
wow

What he say
Canadian Canabis firm Aphria just jumped 30% today on its earnings call so apparently, Canada and Canabis work well together. Admittedly, they reported a net loss but sharp increase in revenue. Once it merges with Tillray it will be the biggest provider of canabis products in Canada.
Dude let it continue to melt up and watch your gains multiply
Once you buy GME you get a email linked
Sure do. Don't drink tho
I think it moons before the summer, but I like to minimize risk and maximize gain
Could you shed more light on this? How is it beneficial to hold for longer?
You have reached WSB God status. 

Although you should sell those calls soon, and let the shares ride. That way you can get a bigger and fancier yacht.
Oh we are getting fucked here boys

WALL STREET NEEDS TENDIES.
Can someone tell me why the hell gamestop keeps going up? It makes no sense to me
Biden mentioned us
Short interest in 72 million shares. Float is 68 million. Tradeable shares. The puts where an extra way to make money assuming things went to plan. Essentially, all I have to note is keep buying shares on dips, bulls üöÄ bears BIGLY fukt.
Did Biden just call us out ‚òπÔ∏è
This is not the way. They are incredibly safe long term growth holds
Give yourself some credit.  Your question was probably AMAZING!!!

üöÄüöÄüöÄ
WHY BIDEN TRY TO CALL US OUT, WERE ALL JUST TRYNA MAKE IT
is JB's lip okay
It‚Äôs over boys
sounds like you don't have an answer but yes why can't i ask such question?
Lol much safer to say that here than out there

Yes, there is a difference. "Letting the covered call expire" is basically doing the Wheel wrong. Close it or roll it, before expiration.

*Squeezes can, however involve large stocks and billions of dollars, as happened in October 2008 when a short squeeze temporarily drove the shares of* *Volkswagen* *on the* *Xetra DAX* *from* *‚Ç¨**210.85 to over ‚Ç¨1000 in less than two days, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world. Short squeezes may also be more likely to occur when a large percentage of a stock's float is short, and when large portions of the stock are held by people not tempted to sell.*

futures apparently like this...maybe?
This isn‚Äôt Mango with Remdesevir
I wouldn‚Äôt but if you think there will be sell off

I pretty sure they will voluntarily recall.
Oh fuck.... He just called out Wall Street. We're fucked if he doesnt turn this around
Y‚Äôall remember when a cough meant SPY puts? Lmao
Did Biden really said let's get millions with BB?
Damn Bro ty all in.
USO was not designed to be a long term investment. 

Google the terms contango and negative roll yields to learn why. 

A really brief explanation is that the fund has to sell the expiring oil contracts before delivery and then purchase further dated contracts usually at a higher price. They are constantly selling low and buying high.
Buyden looks like a  ü•î

Aaaaand the number is already down to $1,400, less than 24 hours after I told you that you weren‚Äôt getting 2k, and less than a month after Joe promised you‚Äôd get $2,000 as soon as you gave him a win in Georgia. 

You‚Äôre welcome.

WHAT CRISIS WE ROLLING JOE LEAVE US ALONE
Still, the last few months have shown that even if tech is here to stay, sometimes there are much better short term investment opportunities. Foreign, small cap and value stocks have been soaring while most of OP's companies have traded sideways. A bit of diversification never hurts.
sold today with 350%
You should just quit med school and trade stonks

The profit you make from selling options, is it taxed as short term capital gains? Thus meaning you're taxed whatever the rate of your income tax bracket is?
Everytime he mispronounces take a drink

Atomic? Freudian
I‚Äôve only lost money on this shit stock
Yeah I own 120 shares of ARKG, but just bought CRSP when they had that big dip a few weeks ago. Also bought PACB, and am looking to get into more, but I‚Äôm waiting for those big dips that happen with biotech somewhat frequently.
Ay Biden can you just flip this speech around real quick my calls ain‚Äôt liking this
See how it goes tommorow, don‚Äôt get left holding, but maximum id say hold till next Tuesday after the long weekend
im speechless
same. I love mint for spending tracking and goals for my cash. 
Though they have a lot to be desired when it comes to tracking investments though I'll say I've liked the updates to investment but they don't help me too much yet.
I'd honestly pay for Mint if they let me make my own reports, alerts and etc.
Lmao this is good satire
Insiders couldn't have even really made this kind of move happen
Do you own any GME? If so, how in the world did you lose money
Who's holding APHA with me? To the moon

Screw off with your crappy pump and dump stock.

Glad that I've lived through so many of these once in a generation crises

Allow factional shares option chains Joe! Do the right thing!
You clearly haven't shopped at express in the past 7 years
That's why I was confused why people are reccomending more Tilray than Apha.

What am I missing? Will they "adjust" the converstion rate when the merger happens? is the .8381 conversion still valid? or are there more stipulations that I'm not aware of?
Oh come on we are not Wall Street. We now own Wall Street. Cramer said so.
Very nice. You must have bought right after he was on cnbc. So did I. 125 shares.
already miss donny pump
He could've bought Tesla 8 months ago and made 5 times the amount back today.

Just so you know for DoorDash. Some people will tell you that‚Äôs a very risky stock with bad fundamentals and it‚Äôs massively overvalued. A stock like that could lose you a lot of money.
I‚Äôm a user and I love it. If they would develop it more to be the complete package from order to cash it would be unreal. Unfortunately always have to rely on other systems for some parts of it.
GME is impervious to anything Biden says
Looks like stimmy was already priced in. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ima join ya.. but I do occasionally buy FDs..

Also, I wonder how many people here call them FDs without knowing what it means.. I wanna hear Cramer say it
üöÄ?
Biden is sounding pretty bearish...
16.8% in 2019.

Thank you for making me to look deeper. Learned quite a bit.
My $32 call 1/2022 is at 7.90 cost and valued at 8.85... so it's not great but still profitable
I started off making $50k in 2015 doing quasi-finance work with a degree in finance. Worked my way up and moved over to marketing and now overall comp is somewhere between $110-125k depending on company performance. Marketing budgets are quite healthy; there‚Äôs money to be made in it. Focus on digital marketing and SEO and you should be able to get a decent paying job out of school
You know I might actually like Biden if he wasn‚Äôt a dinosaur
Did he mention GME?
i mean as long as it goes at open tomorrow just sell it and secure whatever $$
There were more shares shorted than shares existed.

&#x200B;

What we've basically done is bought all the shares so the short sellers can't even buy the shares they need to get out of their positions.  In so doing, we've basically put rocket fuel on the fire.  Options expire tomorrow at close.  No shares for the shorts to buy, the brokers will FORCE the shorts to cover at any price the broker needs to pay in order to acquire the shares.  More rocket fuel.

&#x200B;

TL:DR:  Stonk go up.  Way up.  Stonk continue to go up.

He's talking about ROI, that's bullish?
Why are his hands like that??

No I don‚Äôt think I will
Biden ain‚Äôt said one good thing yet what the fuck pls
Hey you want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money FRIENDS.

Just so you know for DoorDash. Some people will tell you that‚Äôs a very risky stock with bad fundamentals and it‚Äôs massively overvalued. A stock like that could lose you a lot of money.
Holy fuck...okay, seriously. This guy deserves recognition just for the balls of steel. I can't believe anyone would do this, unless they had several hundred million lying around.
Follow the money baby.. this mofo called gme when it was $3
Biden basically saying "we're firing up the printers" brrrrrr

Only in the world of GME calls does +121% look like the "wrong" investment.
Why the fuck would Joe biden even mention GameStop
Calm down you autists, "Helping main street"=Stimmy Money

It will be financed with deficits not taxes, that means stocks go up.
Baba mooning in hk , our leaps coming back from the ground !
Just say you‚Äôll give stimulus so more can dump into the market. My god, GET TO THE FUCKING POINT
Thanks!
Instruction unclear, bought 50
I think fundamentals for GME are good. In all honesty I think this weeks run up is a correction, but an upwards one. Fueled by Ryan Cohen and management change, plus sales reports. And now Cramer is talking about us and even more join in on the eventual and ultimately insane squeeze. A lot will profit take when it squeezes, including myself. But I‚Äôll merely be hedging my position down on the way down. I don‚Äôt believe I could time a peak nor do I intend to try. Instead Ill sell a small portion once the squeeze is over but I‚Äôll still hold GME long term because I think Ryan Cohen could do something with it.
WOOF!
I wish I could buy stocks but I do not live in the USA .....
What'd he say
STIMMY BUYDEN STIMMMMYYY

Over 40% of the American workforce makes less than $15 an hour. If you think there‚Äôll be some magical productivity increase and not the shift of business owners looking to eliminate as many expenses as possible then that‚Äôs your opinion I guess.
No
Too many people asking about the next GME, guess what it is still gonna moon even more. Plus, this DD and thesis has been legend on WSB for the past 6 months. Even if you were handed the golden DD from DFV himself you probably would not have the balls or the understanding to bet big and win.

I mean to be clear, this was truly retarded.

But congratulations on the win.

CATHIE BOUGHT PLTR
Ok here we go. Step forward is to dump money in EV and clean energy.
Dumb question that I think I know the answer to. 

If I set up a taxable brokerage account and automatically contribute 1000/mo into a mutual fund, say three years from now I want to withdraw all of it. If I have been investing the whole time, will I pay short-term capital gains tax on the contributions that were made within the last 12 months? I assume the answer is yes but am seeking confirmation.
Thus why spent new car money on taxes in 2020 to convert a Roth.  GTFO taxing my tendies.
Why would you be upset? You‚Äôll be doubling your pay at Wendy‚Äôs.
bro looks like we were cautious and kinda wrong lol

squeeze is here. i wrote $40 calls for tomorrow. might miss the big upside if this continues

where do you see this going now?
Joe giving mixed messages to the algos
All he has to do is say brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Yada yada yada. Just talk about GME is the future of renewable energy
This article explains it very well. Basically, you pay a lower capital gains tax rate for assets held longer than one year.

Yeah that's right, you're not sure which way it will go. Some brokers will let you set a stop limit, so after the stop buy order executes it will swap to a limit sell for whatever you set the limit it. You might set the limit sell in that example at 120.

Clean energy wooooooo
MOOOOOON
What happened to PLTR?
HE SAID IT, ICLN TO THE MOON BOYS!
I started buying around $14 but sold at the first spike and rebought as it went below $19 so my avg is showing at $18.56 now.  Though I did profit on the first sale I only netted about 20% and missed the majority of the run-up due to my paper hands. That lesson was valuable though, when I saw it at $28 yesterday I said nope. Without that lesson I would have done it again. You should be saying that with pride! Most people‚Äôs skepticism prevented them from buying in at all. Also, think about the people who lost money on GME yesterday. 

I sat on the sidelines with skepticism as I watched other people make $ on meme stocks pretty consistently so this time I put $5k on GME and it has paid off handsomely so far - 0 due diligence, as is standard around here.

But then again the hype stock is getting could set it off and the shorts get extra fucked and we go to the moon
"We need to prioritize aid to those business affected the most, black owned businesses, hispanic owned businesses, Gamestop, and Plug.
Most importantly, they don‚Äôt have cable tv assets. I dumped T and threw that money into LUMN. I think any telecom that has cable tv or satellite tv legacy businesses will underperform as people drop their tv packages and instead just go internet. I wouldn‚Äôt doubt if the giant telecoms/media giants start to spin-off pieces of themselves in the next five years. And honestly, even with the iffy customer service, CTL has the best gigabyte service in my area.
Clean energy. FCEL to the moon üöÄüöÄ

On the chart I see a long 7+ year base, a great springboard for a big leg up. I‚Äôve had some other stocks that I bought 7 or so years ago that finally started to move again after a long down to flatline period ie DDD and GOGO. It‚Äôs BB‚Äôs turn.
It will go up with oil. As Brent keeps rising, this will rise too regardless of technicals.

Biden used stimulus pump. It‚Äôs not very effective

When you exercise the option you lose all the additional time value you have (which is a lot for something in april/june), so best bet is to sell the contract when you're comfortable with the price and buy back in with shares if you wanted to re-enter

HE SAID HEAVEN = OUTER SPACE
Oh noooo, my comment became a 'stock picker's' paradise. I am an index fund investor, so I will never tell you to buy individual stocks. For me, risk-off has been the usual: increase positions in cash, commodities, long term T-Bonds (increasingly adding to these). All new addition to the stock portfolio since the last couple of months has been in ETFs with low tech exposure. Increased my international slice substantially too, mostly focusing on EM. Asset allocation is dynamic and I will change depending on current market conditions. I personally don't believe there will be a crash, a series of corrections perhaps. Great time to save and buy whenever that takes place.
Lady Cathie bought PLTR!!! Load up tomorrow gang!!
Nope. Still on the launch pad. Short interest barely changed they haven‚Äôt begun covering
Give it time homie looking at the charts there's a good chance it'll start moving towards $30 in the coming weeks.

GME is innovating the short squeeze
Depends on your risk tolerance. There will be a higher federal tax on short term holdings, but if the stock goes back down more than maybe 10% it‚Äôs current level, then the tax savings are negated. Usually if something has a sudden boom, it‚Äôs not typical and will often result in big sell offs. What‚Äôs usually safer is steadier growth. If it ‚Äúbroke out‚Äù like you said, then I‚Äôd not be surprised if the wolves start to want to bank their gains.

Remember you‚Äôre competing against everyone else, focus on your interests first. Ask yourself what your risk tolerance is, and if you‚Äôre comfortable playing more Russian roulette.

Otherwise, if you sell it and take the profit, and it still goes up later, don‚Äôt worry - that will always be part of the game. However if you reinvest in another stock and that also gains value, then you actually didn‚Äôt really lose much in the end.

There‚Äôs really no right answer, you can make good money a lot of ways, as long as there‚Äôs validity to it.

Congratulations by the way! ü•≥
He said ‚Äústonks go up‚Äù

Fact.  Had some money parked with them for a year.  It's a sit and collect dividend stock
Thanks - I didn't realize you were going to keep the sheet updated.

I would say for someone like me I'm mostly interested in the changes - so increases by percent and also new positions.  It's kind of hard to do that with the sheet since it's locked and I can't sort without breaking the link to your sheet.  And yes I know we're talking about a few minutes of scrolling, but it would be worth it for people that actually use it.
Looking forward to part 3
Biden sound bullish af
I would look at r/stocks they are more for beginners/stocks to invest in and they would probably help you a lot. I don‚Äôt use Robinhood I use Stockpile but so many people use robinhood so you‚Äôre probably good with that! Personally I don‚Äôt have a ton of money seeing as I‚Äôm only 17 lol but I like to invest little chunks of money into big companies (Amazon, apple, etc) just for easy money. But I also like to throw money into companies that are newer and are going to do well. My favs right now are AMD and NIO, they‚Äôve given me a lot of return and I don‚Äôt even own many shares. Just invest in what you like and what you believe in, you‚Äôve got it!

Thanks for listenin
God damn, bunch of beta cucks on Wall Street.  What‚Äôs different from this stimulus than when Trump pumped it out?  Why the fuck we bleeding out?!!
What is the Yahoo ‚Äúestimate‚Äù if not a guess?
After 17x gains in my TSLA shares, this is my first option trade - I don‚Äôt know what any of this means, but I love it
WSB, let's get this dipshit Tyler at Citi fired.
I disagree, leave the door open for more retards to wonder in :)
Biden's speech is about future speeches.

Like, I get it, but after today I wanted to hear something to move the needle.
Congrats! Now fuck off.
Should I buy GME shares at open tomorrow or put a limit order in for $40 hoping to get filled during a dip?
FCELL HE SAID IT NOW WILL YOU FUCKING GO UP
Hell yes, BB to the moon

Look at ballie Gifford. Closest thing I can find to ARK
One thing I love doing is switching over to Stonktwits and reading the comments of all the bears posting how they can't wait to short GME cause its ran up 100% in two days.  And I thought WSBers were the autistic ones! These folks are about to get run over.
I would Rick roll the shit out of Cathie
ARKW bought 500k shares of PLTR, hope you boys bought them calls!!
Most beautiful thing I‚Äôve ever witnessed on WSB. For everyone reading this take one lesson: CONVICTION WINS.

Yes actually.
he said clean energy and nothing happened.

Oh Its pumping. üöÄ
This guy was buying Jan 15, 2021 calls 18 months ago. Either time machine or insider trading. Either way, props to him for making it work, but there is no way he timed it down to the day from 18 months ago. Cannot convince me otherwise.
Is that why it‚Äôs running AH?

Is there any possible way to set a sell order on a certain day. Instead of a sell limit at a given price just doing an input of a certain day, or is this not a thing?

Hey you want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money FRIENDS.
BB even though GME is booming..
 Because GME options have really high IV at this point.. few days of no movement will cause really high IV crush and you will lose a lot.
Fun fact he‚Äôs publicly admitted to liking PLTR

Maybe I have to work on how I layout my posts,  it there really are only a couple motives behind posting about a stock. 

-asking for a second opinion on something one is looking at. 
-sharing personal or third party DD because your Invested in The stock and want it to hit its potential. 
-you‚Äôre bashing a stock to buy cheap or are shorting it. 
-lying and trying to create false hype for a pump n dump

I just think with earnings growth, and that at least in of the tests they are working on will bear fruit. And if so, this  5M share company has the potential to provide good returns from here.

Merger vote is still the 20th and if yes merger 22nd right, I looked a lot and didn‚Äôt see otherwise.
In all fairness, I just deleted my fb and IG accounts, and it *ain‚Äôt* because I‚Äôm bitter about trump being banned, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm grossed out by how far they let this mess go before doing something.

I don't know if the conversion is set in stone. I think it will be close to an even swap imo. It's minimal either way unless you are looking for a short win. Imo I think this merger should set up for a longer play for me. I bought and will try not to pay to close attention for a few years.
HE SAID CLEAN ENERGY
NO WHAT THE FUCK. ICLN WAS SUPPOSE TO MOON
This guy held onto the call since January or something? I didn't check his post history, but that is absolutely nuts. I can't imagine anyone not having a heart attack, unless they'd forgotten about it.

#To anyone who is new here:

Buy shares and enjoy the ride 


A lot of firms and people have shorted GME to the point that there aren‚Äôt enough shares available to go around for them to close. 

As share prices barely go up, the dollars short and damage they incur reacts exponentially.

These firms could be getting burned longer and harder than Australia (not making a joke)

Cathie is trying to baghold PLTR like the rest of us

No. China's recovery was largely facilitated by strong public health controls. 'oppressive' or 'stringent and effective' depending on the propaganda team, obviously. "China has a lot of slaves" is an ugly truth that isn't necessarily relevant everywhere. But surely you are smart enough not to answer their supposition with something laden with fresh fallacies of your own...

üòÇüòÇ
Basically, yes.

If it's a cash account, you need settled cash. If it's a margin account, you need buying power and settled cash is one way to have enough. There are exceptions for certain special situations, like a vertical spread that expires ITM.

But a better answer is **never exercise**. With only a few exceptions, you shouldn't ever need to exercise.

I don't have a ton of experience, but once you don't "need" a job, it suddenly is a lot less stressful, when you don't "have" to care. 

I was a lifeguard in high school and in my 4th year of guarding at a water park, the owners sold to new owners who treated me and other employees like trash. A lot of people quit and they started needing lifeguards more than ever - so I knew I had leverage and couldn't be disciplined. Combined with an acceptance letter to my dream college, I was willing to quit at any time because I didn't need the job and I was only sticking around because it was fun: saving people, first aid, hot women to hang out with all day, fun parties after work on the weekends. 

At one point I mocked a boss and her ridiculous way of criticizing me (she didn't like the way I was using the leaf blower when opening the park before the guests arrived) and she threatened to fire me. I snapped back something like "I'd love to see you try! I know you're short on lifeguards this year - there's no way you can fire me - and guess what, I don't care! I literally am doing this job for fun and will never need this place as a reference." As a teenager, it felt so empowering to stick up for myself. She put her tail between her legs, ran away, and apologized later. She knew I didn't need the job and she knew I was only doing it for fun. Making it not fun for me would only hurt their business. 

Once it was clear who had the upper hand in the relationship, the stress of working for the terrible new owners went away because they knew I wouldn't put up with their crap.
Wait when are you selling them?
Lets gooooooüöÄüöÄ
Nice try, cats only drive scooters.

But to answer your option question, yes. For me, it‚Äôs usually a debit spread going south where I buy back the shorts and then sell the longs at an even worse price than if I‚Äôd have just stuck with the initial plan.

Astute observation. It's true you can pretty much throw a dart blindly these days and make solid gains. That's what happened to me when I literally just bought meme stocks and blue chips with 0 trading knowledge. Then things started moving sideways in October. That was a wake-up call to actually learn a thing or two about stock picks. 

If someone were to actually invest the time now into the technical and fundamental aspects of trading and investing, they will certainly have an edge once the market "normalizes".

$400k in savings?
PLTR WTF... are my 1/15 27c actually going to cash??
Ok, I‚Äôm gonna say it, photoshop?
I would never use a stop loss for a few reasons:

1. Flash crashes happen. That's a great way to sell at 10-20% under the current price with no way to buy back in at that level.
2. Taxes. I don't want to lock in a gain when I'm not ready for it.

And it's worse when 1 and 2 both happen, where you sell your stock way below market rate and still owe a bunch of taxes for capital gains. That's just not appealing to me.
Where? I‚Äôm interested too. I saw many posts showing that it didn‚Äôt move, haven‚Äôt seen anything about 2/3 covering. Highly doubt it... the price would‚Äôve absolutely blasted off there are 68m shorts
You're telling me. Ive been holding ICLN 34 and 35 calls that expire tomorrow, and Im down a fair bit on them.

MY GOD

THIS IS ART
Yeah I know but more EV = nickel pump.
Biden confirmed $2k more yolo money for us degenerates
I literally spent all December finally saying maybe this is the stronger strategy. Small gains are easy to grab in a swing, especially with limit orders.

Let‚Äôs say I swing 4 trades of +10% in a 3 month period, or 1 trade of +30% in the same time frame. I made more on the 10% trades, they really add up! Plus getting 30% involves serious DD, 10% swings are common in most volatile stocks. You should still do DD ofc, and also be prepared to study up and know which stocks to cycle through, but if you‚Äôre willing to do the work then it can be a nice payoff if it does workout.

Good luck :)

Hey thanks I love that movie
!remindme 74 days
I personally own gme 

29jan50c x 2

15jan40c x 4

29jan39c x 1

shares

If you want to help the retards at 55cc you should buy 47c to bridge the gap but that's probably a bad move, if you want good odds/liquidity you should by 40c. But it's too late, futures are up 5% already (we're at 42). I'm not sure what's the best anymore. Probably whatever is closest to being ITM in the morning would be best, or a far off strike with a longer date.

I felt the 29jan50c were good. bought them at 3. Actually wanted to buy 2 more of em but couldn't

Can't really recommend anything. Didn't want to give my EXACT position because i didn't want to just make money off of people buying my options.
Dear Mr Melvin I can‚Äôt wait to sell you my GME shares at $69. DM if interested
I bought half a grand in $8 calls for Jan 2022 a day or two ago.

How retardedly stupid/genius is this? Don't know anything about fundamentals but...

* we definitely gonna open up by summer
* the smaller players are going under leaving AMC with more business
* four Marvel blockbusters, Spider-Man to top it all off in Dec

Lemme know what you all think. Trying to be less (actually more) retarded. I just don't see streaming as a replacement for seeing blockbusters at the movie theatre. All the homies want things to go back to normal so we can go see the big pictures.
Pltr pumping
Haha DAL go brrrrr. Keep pumping!

Lmao
So... . how do you feel? you turn your 80k or so to $10M?

For your initial play last year, were you banking on short squeeze or what have you? (you have a link on backstory?)
GME is a pop play on shorts and console sales. BB is a long term sleeping giant
You right I also got 15c 1/29
Cathie just saved PLTR
Like JuJu would say if talking about the autists.  

They‚Äôre a bunch of nameless grey faces.  The autists is the autists.

Yeah but they're probably going short at higher price points. It's like dollar cost averaging when you buy stock at too high a point and buy when lower, shorts sell at higher amounts to average out.

At some point they'll sell the top the way you can eventually but the bottom. But they might get margin called by that time.

I just worry the short interest doesn't tell the full story. Even if they are rolling their shorts higher, they're definitely bleeding everytime they have to do that.

I love you degenerates
To open myself to ridicule, is buying GME stock wise tomorrow. I would like definite answers - will it go up or down?
I was in a similar situation like you about two months ago and used robinhood to start off at. Once you have a feel of everything and want to go to buying stocks past the 25K range, you should start going to a different platform for stock trading. Also look into what you want whether its short term or long term. As retarted as this place is, WSB is great to have an idea around long term stocks. The stocks I've bought so far were from this subreddit and I've gotten a lot of money just from shares already. Also avoid doing the whole calls and puts til you feel 100% comfortable losing money from stock trading. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Get robinhood to start off then change later. Buy $MGNI
Gotcha. But you could theoretically just sell for a quicker but possibly lower profit? Assuming it hits the right price.
Thank you!
No fuckin way
> They're now worth $12. $12 * 100 * 5 contracts = $6,000.

this calculation is confusing to me. Where does the 12 come from? What happened to $15 strike? shouldn't it be ($20 - $15) * 100 * 5 - $10 paid for calls? 

you buy stocks at 15 and sell at 20, so $5 profit per share, 1k shares = $5000 - 5*$2 = $4990 profit

They say the best traders of a generation can switch with the market, the beast that it is. 
Theres a place where this makes sense to catch the potential longer growth of bullish but right now indulging the stocks that are MEME'ing larger gains works.
Keep the tech analysis stuff as a skill that will make solid gains when shit calms down but right now .m follow the money ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
Diversify out of your company stock holdings when you‚Äôre permitted. Both your employment and a percentage of your net worth will be tied to its success or failure if you do not, which is too much risk. If you want to keep some, the rule of thumb is to not hold more than 5% of your investments in any one holding.

I dont believe that Americans are having a problem finding food to eat bruh. Lets be honest, we fat as fuck
Idk, there's logic either way: congress is backed up with impeaching the mango and will be for a while, thus dems won't be able to pass any cool legislation and green energy will stagnate and IV crush occurs, or people will keep hopping on the train anyway. You could go for the $0, no expiration calls as well, as I think it may be hard to predict precise price target and dates with a new administration.

 definitely deserved, after you kept that one through the valley of tears last march :)

Since you made such good experiences what stops you from starting another $1k apple call for expiry in mid of 2022?
Can take more than 10 years. Some companies make it to billions in 10. The question I‚Äôd be asking myself is if you believe in the people and the company. Do people at work get excited really when you hit milestones or is it fake? And the product, do you see it taking off? 
I made the mistake of thinking I could loose all my money as it was after the crash and never invested that much in the company I worked for and cashed in 5x and only because of a takeover I had to. I knew it  would take off it was a no brainer but I had the crash fear in me and I needed my savings for a house. I would have paid the whole deposit on the house if i went all in
Saved me today...thanks bruv.
Valuation wise the stock should be at $200-300 based on latest revenue that's supposedly is gonna come out. Cohen (guy that turned chewy into a massive company) bright 3 other chewy members into GME.

So besides the short squeeze there's still shit ton of potential.

If the short squeeze starts I'm waiting for $500.

If you have no one to buy while its rocketing then youre stuck with it until it expires at the end of the day.  You'll take stock price minus strike price as profit. If strike is higher than stock price then its worthless and you lose your premium.

Up to you. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor. I wrote a skit about Christian Bale based on the events unfolding in front of me in a meme subreddit that calls itself a casino. 

That said, if you look at the DD and decide GME is only gonna go up, does it really matter what price you buy in at in 40s 50s or even 60s?
Up 5% in AH. I was wondering why the jump.
Movie theatres will sadly die because of movies being premiered on streaming app. Disney will faze out theatres and go make people buy their Disney plus rather than go to a theatre. Soon all movies will just be premiered on their respective streaming app.

For me its depends on how high it goes, I'm hoping if its confirmed lucid we could see nikola, xpeng or hell even NIO market cap within the year. Especially considering they launch the Air soon and supposedly have better tech than Tesla. I think Nio and Tesla have a lot more going on for the company but I can easily see atleast with regards to EVs. These will be the three leaders in the end.

China: Nio
Western + Maybe worldwide: Tesla
Middle East/ Saudi/Dubai: Lucid

Thx cathie
When did you buy these?
Thanks for sharing the enthusiasm. Was intrigued, but I was persuaded by all the negative stuff on Seeking Alpha. Major theme there is that the AI revenue is a small on an absolute basis. And a small % of total revenue. Also it seems their R&D spend is low for a co in the AI space. They had a decreasing spend in R&D for 6 quarters in a row. Co spent just $3.6 million in R&D in 3Q2020. So super interested to know what is appealing to the bulls, that I am missing?

I understand that. 

I am making the point that short term capital gains are treated as taxable income. From OP's point of view - it doesn't really matter. The contribution limits are based on a tax payer's modified AGI. Since it sounds like OP is making less than 125K - they can contribute up to the 6K limit. 

AFAIK - the ROTH funding requirement is based on a cap of modified AGI. Where the funds comes from should not matter. It could be a gift, inheritance, selling an asset, or in OP's case from day-trading gains.
nah not now. He can't afford to crash the market. maybe next year.

Lol what FD you throwing it in
If there is any meaningful amount of money involved consult a tax advisor. Generally though:

- Invest in Irish-domiciled ETFs for an easy life since they will handle all this stuff in a really optimal way (Ireland has amazing tax treaties for funds based there) but always check the UK reporting/distributor status (will be listed for ishares, vanguard etc). You can hold US shares this way without stress.

- it's funds/ETFs not stocks. So if you hold USA stocks and complete a W8-BEN page (and are eligible to do so - e.g. UK tax resident), you will pay a dividend withholding tax of 15% on US stocks in a dealing account or ISA and 0% inside a SIPP. This tax deduction will be automatically done by your UK broker. W8-BEN available easy peasy at your broker. 

- btw I personally recommend AJ Bell and HL as good UK brokers you can do the W8-BEN online with them too.

- Making life even more complicated, if you die holding a bunch of USA shares as a UK citizen, your executor must do a tax return to the USA if you held over $60000 shares, I believe. Again a point in favour of just investing via Irish ETFs (or!!! UK investment trusts! look at theaic.co.uk. Learn what a 'discount' is in the context of an IT. These can be like getting ETFs at a discount rate, depending on market conditions. 100% UK domiciled too, ez pz for tax stuff). NAIT is one I recall from memory
ARK just bought a ton from what I read
Biden announced that GME will be used as a Covid vaccine distribution center. You can also use trade credit to pay for the vaccine!

Why did I sell my PLTR calls!?!
why didnt' I buy more
Things look fucking priced in... How did spy not move up and up after stimmy announcement
If I have a worthless position 1dte for a widely traded trending stock, I always throw in some extra contracts end of day to try to average down, i figure what's an extra couple of bucks to average it down just in case news.  You will be surprised how often this works for at least a pop in the morning.
Cathie bought half a million shares

You better buy calls because $10,000,000 is going to be the new $1,000,000 pretty soon.

2k total. 600 + 1400
Overall, perhaps, but as a "low stress" gig I'm not so sure. The work that patrollers do is very serious, and you're dealing with people who are having a very bad day. There's a reason why they have x-ray facilities in the lodge!
Should have done that today while it was stagnant.

But yea, a lot of people are expecting the Dems to pump ICLN
I have no problem calling cathie daddy after this rip
Cathi of ARK bought 500,000 shares

Guess who sold today
Got one $10 3/19C at 3:59pm after extensive DD (saw a post with BB and lots of rockets). Let‚Äôs go!
No wonder why it just jumped to 26.30 after hours. Better buy some calls at open ! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
If you feel bad about yourself, just remember that I threw 3k shares overboard at 23 yesterday because my self-esteem is afraid of success. Have to physically restrain myself to stop from paper handing winning plays.

The SEC deals with such specific and technical issues. At the level of the Chairman and commissioners, even those with industry or law firm experience depend heavily on staff expertise.

I see the role of SEC commissioners not so much as managers, but more to set policy and priorities for the organization and to rule on enforcement actions. An industry background could help, but so could other backgrounds.

Let it dip in the morning, then pick some shares up when you start noticing it trend upwards after a bit. 

Thinking it might have a similar period to today
Lets say that the current average short price is way higher, lets say 10.
That leaves 30$x60M, or 1.8B in total losses on shorts excluding fees.
There is certainly potential for a squeese.

Also seems like the lender can reclaim the stock at anytime with or without reason. They just usualy don't since they rely on trust. Having your short position terminated at an inoportune time without reason must really suck balls.
Ill buy 100 shares after hours if you do.  Lets all make some rocket money!!!!!
They already gave $600
I also like Lucid‚Äôs plan, the Air this year, with less expensive models coming in future years. But releasing the ‚Äúbest ev on the market‚Äù in year 1 is SMART.

That was a complete joke

Who has the biggest shorts on GME?
Are there any metrics better than just short volume for seeing if shorts have started covering? It's possible that they have and new short positions are being opened at current levels and so short volume hasn't dropped right? Or am I thoroughly smooth brained
We have the best energy. People, very smart people, say it‚Äôs the greenest. It will rise. If you don‚Äôt buy it you can die. Like a dog

Correct even at this price it is still undervalued. Which is why most of us are still holding our positions. If Chewy crew executes their plan then this is a 5 bagger from here easy if you have patience.

TRUE FUCKING AUTIST
Cathie if you‚Äôre reading this pleas buy GME
Yep, but I sold 25% today around .014. Hard to pass that up when I was at 1100% gain. I'm riding the rest though!
Yes, it's a CSP and I run the wheel. Except unlike the traditional wheel where you open a new CSP as soon as you close you're current one or it expires, I look for opportunities in different stocks instead.
Y'all talking about BB and PLTR but you know BBBY has a 70M shares short (61%), we're two days in the BBBY short squeeze having traded around 50M shares which OBVIOUSLY isnt only shorts covering... We've got a long way to go until all shorts are squeezed out here

PLTR just jumped from 24.90 to 26.36 post market
I did this too but fortunately had the "buy and hold!" mentality of orevio index investing. That helped me hold on instead of panic selling. Also led to a bit of unwise bagholding. :P Saved my account from plummeting overall, so for the year, I have some pretty decent "idiot gains." Finally learned strategies for buying in at non-hype, letting the winners run, and cutting the losers earlier.
thanks!

U got this fam
Stock is up another 25+% since this advice lol.

It's certainly a gamble. Doesn't sound like you've really vetted the available DD abd you're parroting old narratives. 

But at the moment all that matters is hoe many shorts are outstanding who will get margin called into continuing this squeeze action or who will sell to avoid further pain.

I'm setting stop losses at 30% below current price to lock in gains without getting shaken out on the way up.
pltr tomorrow? pltr tomorrow.
I‚Äôm not mad just disappointed
PLTR is special
Did biden say buy pltr? Wtf?
It is, with PLTR hype recently it can really take off. I expect a big day tomorrow with the after hours today. And I was thinking it was gonna be way more mellow...guess WSB has some crazy sway after GME
BUY PLTR NOW OR AT OPEN ITS GOING TO 30. DEMO NEXT WEEK, RECORD EARNINGS INC
I've been selling on my way up. I've already recouped my initial investment several times over. I may sell another 50-100k shares between .25 and .50 but I won't go below 100k shares ever. I think it's way over priced now, but everything I thought was going to happen with this stock in the last couple months has been wrong, in the best way.
no
i‚Äôm late why is bb ripping
Why is TDOC in ARKF lol?
Nice
I'm so hard right now.
In my trading account I literally buy stocks based on how long the DD is on reddit, I couldn't give a fuck about anything else. I haven't lost money on a single trade and the majority are >10% inside a couple of weeks. It's genuinely impressive to have lost money over the past year

Thx need to change my lower attire now
I will not buy in, therefore ensuring GME skyrockets. You‚Äôre welcome.

What do i buy now?
Same here man, and a few April calls that have been bleeding this week haha. üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Wow, I hadn't looked at them in awhile because they've struggled to break out for so long.  I hold some through a semiconductor ETF, but not individually.  The level they've suddenly jumped to in the past couple months hasn't even been approached since mid-2000.  That's honestly somewhat scary.

It's mooning because whoever decided it was the time.

Maybe BB. Apparently they're a cybersecurity company now and people are just starting to realize it's not a shitty phone company anymore.
Are you serious?
how do you get these updates
Currently have no stocks. Wad waiting at 1.05 for it to drop just below 1 to invest and it drove away and left me behind. So now I'm waiting for the dip tomorrow to invest in. It will double dip 100%. So for me I will just accept the loss of the gains I could have made and just be grateful for the gains I'm going to make come investment tomorrow and seel on Tuesday
Dude, Democrats control both houses and senate. They can easily pass it.
This sub is always the easiest to exceed in because people rightly assume stupidity first
Let's show GME gang who's boss!!
Got Goldman instead

IPO  and trading fees
Why is it up so much?  I missed it.
Posted 2 minutes ago on his community tab:

 PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH $SENS.  This rise has no fundamental support right now, and I fear that this is a P&D. The nearest catalyst I found online is not until the end of the month. My community is NOT large enough to be pumping this, and I do not understand what is going on.  I posted in the interest of transparency since the chart indicated a buy to me BEFORE I could possibly publish my video.  I'm sharing a screenshot of my position so you can see my average cost. That is where I felt comfortable entering. I WOULD NOT feel comfortable getting in with the price where it is right now.  I will show you this same average cost and position size in my video on Sunday, and I will NOT be selling. This is a long position for me.
Finally to the moon üöÄ
Take me with you Cathie!
Cathie wood
Forever legendary
Yeah that‚Äôs my though too. I foresee $100 at least so a couple dollars a share isn‚Äôt a big deal. I got premarket orders in rn
They spend a lot on lobbying, bought Gulf Power which uses a lot of coal. They fight against rooftop solar and hydro. Slashed their dividend recently. Allete has a much better dividend.
No day trades left and don‚Äôt have any positions to close on tomorrow sadly. Anyone buying and holding for weekend? If so what
i did the same by putting limit orders in today. wouldn‚Äôt hurt to try. but keep your eyes on it because it may blast past $42 and never look back.
Haven‚Äôt seen this mentioned all day, but I‚Äôm bigly up on XOM and also feel like they will benefit from this ‚Äúclean energy‚Äù push.  As evil as they are, they were some of the first to research the science behind climate change (despite keeping it hidden) and I cannot help but believe that they have their fingers in many crevices that will benefit from clean energy spending here and abroad.

Also they pay a fat dividend.  $XOM - bull gang
What do y‚Äôall use to do your taxes and get the most from option losses?

Pltr is on the move right now. Cathie bae to the rescue

Fuck it I‚Äôm going long Bed Bath and Beyond this can‚Äôt go tits up
Been there too, the bad days you always think about what you could of used that money on instead. The green days make things blurry. It‚Äôs all a learning lesson, you‚Äôll be fine in the long run.
wsb strength
why do we vote for old people
My role model!
I already don't like the "sympathetic Joe" voice
I dont know who cathie is and at this point im too afraid to ask
This was my first ever call. I really regret getting in late because I literally wasn't allowed to sell puts in time.
hey daddy say clean energy 3 times before u end
Really it means -5%. They always go down with good news
Ur beautiful
Build Back Better (Greener)
Yes but it‚Äôs promising since Biden is our president now. There‚Äôs a lot to say about icln but i recommend you do some research first before buying. also do some research on ARKK, ARKG, ARKF, etc. too. Your first objective in the first 6 months is to not lose your money:) Don‚Äôt worry too much bout how much you gain. cheers
Easy ü§§
That‚Äôs huge buy
Absolutely- the last couple days were just a correction.  The sqeeze has not happened yet
Sending more money to my depot and buying more GME shares for sure, definitely seeing another huge day coming up. Fuck Melvin and all shorts/short positions.
It‚Äôs 1.4k since they already gave $600
So was $TANH a SCAM or what lmao so confused
Fuck
it got added to ARKW
every single meme stock mooning except icln ü•≤
Hell no. They‚Äôve got 50 plus thousand 24p expiring tomorrow -

Which if you don‚Äôt know means they have to buy a shit ton of stock that we control the price of (as long as we hold and keep buying!) 

-
And as long as they can‚Äôt buy more shares to cover, they‚Äôll be fucked to infinity because the short ratio is above 100%. They‚Äôve shorted more stock than exists.
Of course Joe Biden is going to fuck this up. What was I thinking

From my reading on SaaS, too many players and they are only getting into it.  I still see them as a bulletin board company.  I think the best play in this very fragmented markets with too many small players is the regulatory side such as Metrc - if they go public I would probably invest.  

Here is an article that really opened my eyes to stay away from it as being too fragmented.

This is my exact game plan I‚Äôve 16. Started following ARK and doing half my choices with them now.  Half my own, which some meme stock and gambling and energy.
What does the fraction mean? I'm new to stocks and I want to watch wsb degens in the wild, and knowing the terminology helps
Yeah lmao, i guess it was already picked up by some other instition tho, or just pure retail bulls
Ima pretend I heard it from you first.
Higher priced homes AND a bigger interest rate?  Count me in!!!  The disconnect with the average American is unbelievable.
I sold my pltr at the beginning of the day and moved it into BB. Can‚Äôt be too upset
PLTR $40 EOW
>Did selling and missing out on big upside taint your view of the company or people who are still invested?

If Tesla were to peak to 700 (I sold at 450) then yeah I'd be salty, but even if I held I know there would be *no way* I'd hold past 1200.

When Tesla is worth more than than the next 10 auto makers I'm not going to be salty over a an unexpected and unrealistic valuation.

Compared to forgetting to buy 1000 shares of NIO like I had planned, I couldn't give a shit about making a 50% profit on Tesla and getting out.
I know exactly what that means!

2.5% drop at opening
God chatie is a hottie
Stock market is closed Monday for MLK day.
$1.4K

Adding already $600 equals $2k. 

Same plan that didn‚Äôt go through Senate.
BB is also easy to spell which is a real plus.
Stop trying to recruit into PLTR gang, PLTR gang is depressing.
BUYden pls say clean energy one more time
so the momentum on pltr begins. told yall last week
They need to raise the income cap on the stimmy checks. Daddy needs a new grill
Weeks.
Wake me up when he says fuel cell
Cathie bae picked up 500k shares
I don't believe anyone is getting swindled as it's retail on one side, and financial professionals on the other who could have looked at GME's surprisingly strong balance sheet/made another choice. Your second part is the general thesis of the theoretical "short squeeze", although there is a other intriguing long term thesis for GME
Pltr printing rn in after hours
"And I think we need more EVs rapidly - like those spectacular NIO cars.  Will CCIV and Lucid  merge already? Cmon man!  Last but not least, we need to support our home grown heros...we need Gamestop to thrive - consider buying some GME to support their cause."

Minimum wage has got to be the dumbest thing to do right now. With unemployment rate this high, who's gonna want to employ more people for that high a cost? And then he goes on to give an "aid to small businesses"? It's like kicking someone down then offering them a hand. Man I dislike trump but this guy's a little bit off too.
Amen. couldn't agree more.
well i bough  TRLY, ICLN, and VALE so....yes?

In this market!? If RC becomes CEO at the June shareholder's meeting, or even just chairman, lays out a grand vision for remaking the business, takes some of the debt off the books and gets credit upgrades, FOMO both retail and institutional could definitely take this to $200 by christmas.

Thanks man!

Can't go tits up
For your own sake, please be careful and follow the sound advice that's been given to you.

Very rarely do WSB give this advice, we seriously don't want you to lose it all.

I would avoid options full stop. Trade shares with 10K to get a feel for the market, it won't be the end of the world even if you manage to blow that up.

Do NOT make big trades when you quite clearly have a lot of learning to do. Trading isn't as simple as looking at past charts and thinking it'll go back up.
Only if you are a gay bear
If amc announces it has managed to raise enough money to stay solvent through 2021, I'll probably buy a chunk and see where it goes. It's price is basically as cheap as it will ever be at this point. Assuming it doesn't go under lol
If i use margin to day trade on RH but return it before end of trading day. Do i pay interest?
I saw the P/E was a measly 10... that's a normal 10x valuation during the most retarded bull run in history. P/E 100 puts shares at $600 and makes me a millionaire. 

House on the hills or BUST. See you all in a year.

This is true of course, in hindsight.

At the time in March, people were afraid we could have been entering into a new depression and could have stayed at those levels, or went even lower, for a much longer period of time.

Or basically, we don't know. Hence the risk rating

I'm thinking a 10-15% pullback by the end of February, maybe once we know more about Biden's policies (capital gains taxes?), or perhaps it won't even require a catalyst. Only then will I buy -- I'm 95% cash until then. For what it's worth, also seeing a lot of analysts predict SPY will peak in April, correct, then trade flat to down for the rest of the year. I just received a lot of money in inheritance too, and don't even want to put it in. I find the thought of long-term investing in this environment / at this level to be terrifying.

I agree but people also make poor choices when it comes to what they eat. I know people that only drink juice/soda instead of water. Little choices like eating wheat bread etc. I know that unhealthy food is usually less expensive but sometimes its all about making the better choices when we can.

Obviously you should sell gme when it dips, and buy pltr on top. Have you not followed this sub at all?
That's correct, if you're passive and just going along with company structures. The point of highlighting your own accomplishments is to differentiate you from coworkers and plant a seed in your manager's head before you go to them and ask about the path for promotion.

Personal anecdote: I have managed multiple people, and I tried to reward them appropriately for their contributions. But the ones I actually went to bat for, gave them opportunities to try new things, actively worked with them on growing their careers? They came to me first.

You‚Äôve nailed it. I‚Äôve been searching and reflecting through these gains, mine and others, for the past year or so. The probability of gaining 6/10% vs 20+% is ridiculous. The problem is greed. Often stocks have their ATR and you will gain 8% in a day and you will hold waiting for the target 10.

The more frequently you take small profits the more you can compound gains. I have done in the region of 60 trades with an average return of 6%. 

The real problem is greed and win porn of 1000%. 

I will be here in 10 years making my small gains. The big gainer will be out and bored.

Keeping rates near 0 and printing unlimited amounts of money isn‚Äôt going to lead to a crash. It‚Äôs going to lead to an explosion.   We are devaluing our dollar to nothing, so those gains mean nothing when it‚Äôs in USD and the purchasing power of that dollar continues to crumble.  Just one mans opinion.

My kid was the reason I started trading tho
its been going on so long, I am not sure it will make a difference. the demand to see audits is not new. also Gold is as much a criminal enterprise in being manipulated. the most likely outcome imo is that the criminality will be taken over by the powers-that-be and will carry on in the crypto space. there is too much money and institutional involvement to uncover the rot without big damage, better to take it over.
Ok, let me put it another way:

You've made nearly $2,000,000 in TSLA stocks. Sell around half of it now and you get a guaranteed $1,000,000. For most people, that's already a life-changing amount of money. Let's say stocks rise by 10x in the near future. You'd have $10,000,000 at that point... or, if you were wrong, you'd still have $1,000,000 to fall back on. If you stayed all in, you'd have $20,000,000... or, if you were wrong, you'd have $0 and a lot of regrets. There's not much of a difference practically between $20,000,000 and $10,000,000, you're rich as fuck either way, but there's a huge difference between $1,000,000 and $0.

Obviously this is all simplified and exaggerated, but I hope you get my point. You've gotten an opportunity most could never dream of, don't risk it all because you "really believe in" a company. For the record, I agree with you that Tesla will likely keep growing, but with so much money on the line that's not a risk you should be taking.

What do you think about direction from here since macros are mostly priced in? 

15 dollars for wages at once may strike the inflation up in the near future.  I guess we shall see.
All they way until next week.

There absolutely is potential. It‚Äôs 1.8b now at $40 ($42 in AH). If it jumps to 50 tomorrow, that‚Äôs 2.4b.... The thing that makes this case so special is there are more shorts than the float... when it starts, then there‚Äôs no knowing where it actually ends.

Funny I was banned from this sub for calling out his blatant lies and untruths. Tweety birds and Goldie friends and boastful gains for trades that didn‚Äôt exist and views that no one with credible science or medical backgrounds could ascribe to. And then of course the chicken little reaction to pandemic and then revisionist history post bounce by deleting their history. 
Saw lots like them on Twitter, including the meme‚Äôd ‚Äúmoving to Mexico‚Äù.
More money => more spending => Stock Prices soar

As for how it changes the value of the US dollar. Who cares you‚Äôll be rolling in cash.
The rule is if you need the money within 5 years, don't invest it in the stock market.

https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/101

Ben Felix explained it in one of his podcasts. Timestamp at 31:49. The 0.38% number is at timestamp 38:32.

By not having all of your money tied to the stock market at T+0, you aren't efficiently capturing the rise of the market as a whole. This results in underperformance of your portfolio compared to the market. 

He looked at 10-year rolling periods (Jan 1970 - Jan 1980, Feb 1970 - Feb 1980, etc), individually in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, UK, and the US, of 100% equity portfolios. DCA was done with $1 million over 12 months. 

On average, the annual growth of the DCA portfolio trailed the lump sum portfolio by 0.38%.

*He also looked at bear markets (20% drop) and bull markets (95% of highest P/E ratios), and lump sum still beat DCA >50% of the time.
just curious what do yall use to watch prices AH? I use business insider but I feel like there has to be a better chart somewhere

What did you call me?
It wont unless they get rid of the filibuster
I'm glad you're saying this, I've been buying a 'lil bit of AMD roughly once-a-day when seeing it discounted. 

Even if the bounce doesn't spring itself immediately, the worst-case scenario is just holding until announcements and releases nudge it back up, so why not?
l o w e n e r g y
He hasn't mentioned item one about GME or TSLA and I say - Why?
YAAAAASSSS HE SAID BATTERY TECHNOLOGY!
He said it!!!!
I'm watching it through these comments
The amount of time spent typing your question could have been spent searching GME with dd flair in this sub. 

I could give you shorter version: because: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
>	What happens then? Do people still buy stocks as they go down or do you go cash

Like with any crash, there is fear thereafter.  Dot com happened and the accounting scandals begun.. Enron, world-com, tyco.. Wall Street darlings.  Amazon and other darling ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù companies were -95% and going bankrupt everyday.

You think Tesla is hot today? Have a look at Amazon from 99 to 01.. it later bottomed at $5.xx after having gone up $5 to $100 in under a year from 98-99.

https://i.imgur.com/QZcU2OI.jpg

Amazons historical chart is especially nice because the stock has never split. The prices you see are what they were back then.

‚Äî-

Once average Joe got accustomed to the reality that stocks are ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù and ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt live in your worthless share certificates‚Äù... on came the next great investment to make that you that big money you saw just a few years ago... *real estate.*

So no.. not too many people were talking about stocks until 06-07 and that‚Äôs when the cracks in real estate were coming through.  We know the rest of the story.



On a side note.. Dot com started showing cracks when the fed raised the rates in quick succession spooking the market. It went higher but there was fear.  The accounting scandals, 9/11, war in Afghanistan, then Iraq, hurricane katrina etc all happened back to back to back. No exactly ‚Äúsafe‚Äù from an average Joe‚Äôs point of view.

Anyway..  people are *always* looking to make fast money. It happens again and again.. junk bonds in the late 80s  early 90s, ‚Äúinternet‚Äù stocks in 97-00, real estate and housing derivatives 05-08.  You can see the same patterns play out today in crypto markets, EV and SPAC‚Äôs.  No one asks questions on how this technology can actually be used to *make money*.  It‚Äôs completely secondary to ‚Äúbuy now and sell higher‚Äù ... you know ... *greater fools theory* in action.

Because he can pump and dump and profit off of people who don't understand pump and dumps.

Lot of 2000$ check is gonna go to TSLA OTM calls. If same gamma squeeze happens like last time where all the call sellers are running to buy the stocks to hedge their positions. TSLA gonna have a 1000$ run when the first check comes out.

Current market cap is $1.3 billion actually. 

[Found some press](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/porch-group-announces-four-strategic-210500882.html) showing their projected 2021 revenue was just increased to $170 million, which would represent a 134% YoY growth rate. Doubling would put its P/S ratio just above 15. Without any published financial history, there's not a lot better to go on than that, but by itself, 15 seems reasonable considering the rate of expansion and announcing four acquisitions today. 

To back what you're saying, LazyFA shows total cash/equivalents, plus current assets, totaling approximately 1/5th of the balance on their total liabilities (though LazyFA shows zero debt, so not sure what a liability would be without any debt - I'll chalk this up to newly-public company, lack of available data, as macrotrends isn't showing anything either). 

I can see throwing 0.25% of my portfolio at it for FOMO sake and call it a gambling play, but I wouldn't do more than that without some published numbers and hard data to look at.

No problem man, It's good to keep a note of what ARK is buying and selling. Some smart mofos there.
If consumer buying power moves up it's always a good thing. Anything negative in the markets is an overreaction.

I 100% agree with this, and to me this is a continuous process. But self reviews are a tiny fraction of an overall effort. What matters more is what else you're doing and brokering the other 360+ days a year.

BBY is Best Buy, BB is blackberry. Please get your tendies bro
Biden speech is a classic sell the news
Intentionally making bad choices is gambling. Choices such as buying way OTM calls on the .001% chance you quadruple your return. 

It‚Äôs not gambling if you stick to stocks with stable track records. Making smart choices is investing. In fact, parking your money in a savings account and watching it lose value to inflation every year is a losing proposition. 

But the first time you make more money in a day than you do in a month in your regular job...it is a rush.

At this point should Biden put Cathie in his cabinet?
Wtf am I gonna do if our President isn't mentioning the current DOW price every time he talks?
Darn he just said battery and clean energy and i climaxed!!!
This shit is such a shit pump. Buydon more like Liedon
gonna have to at open
Thanks a lot mate will definitely take that on board. Currently on a reasonably low salary as I'm on my first job after uni but hoping this will change soon, regardless, I'd rather not get taxed any more than I need to so will stick to your advice. Cheers pal
Wait, you sold the 1/15 calls for only 1M?  Ban
Wtf do you think son?

BB, ICLN, PLTR
You are too bullish about your own future for such poor performance. 
Statistics are also against you. Just buy index funds and use your time to learn a marketable skill for a side hustle
I mean...I wouldn't trade having access to the city for being stuck in the middle of nowhere...so it's worth it for me.  I make enough that my 10 year plan is a house in the city and a second house somewhere with lower COL.  Taxes aren't that much higher and I'd have to be paid significantly more to put up with living in low cost of living areas. If it's low COL then there's generally a reason why.
Is Biden papa now?

Money is fungible so right it doesn't matter exactly what the source of the income is, and you're right in that the Roth IRA income limit is based on MAGI, but that has nothing to do with my comment...

They cannot contribute to an IRA if they no earned income, they have to have at least 6k in earned income in order to contribute the full 6k - OP said they have no other source of income, and capital gains is not considered earned income, so no, they cannot contribute to an IRA

I had GME for about 8 weeks, made a peak of 170%, but sold major chunks out at 10/20/50/100. So overall not a huge amount. Maximum per stock was 8%. Your gains are still epic
Did he just use a quadruple negative?
dear god someone help me i dont have enough money to invest in even 1 call of BB and if i sell my current shares i will have to wait until next week to get in which scares me. i didnt get into GME bc i dont ever have any extra cash. what do i do.

How many double negatives was that
I think that while some theaters like AMC are still a risky play, theaters in general are never disappearing. Yes, new releases can be watched from home, but that‚Äôs not the real reason people go. It‚Äôs for the experience. Just like my wife and all her friends, there are still multitudes that want to go. The smell of popcorn, the commercials for checking on what good movies are coming out, and the place itself acting as a social medium for friends and dates all factor into the unique atmosphere it creates (all according to her). It‚Äôs been such a standard for dates and hanging out for the past 100 years that ripping it out of American culture seems highly unlikely. Maybe a really long term play, but the industry will recover for sure
That‚Äôs why he put 2k on BBüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

I generally recommend that people practice with paper trading before trying real money trading, so your mistakes won't cost you money.

You can find the answers to basic questions like this in the resource links at the top of this page. **Getting started in options** is a good place to start.

A limit price is an essential part of a limit order. The order will be filled only for the limit price *or better*. Since you are buying, that means $0.15 or lower. Always use a limit order and actively set the limit. Submit the order (when the market is open -- the market is closed is why yours got queued and got that message) and wait 10 seconds. If it is filled, done. If it is not filled, modify the order (cancel, resubmit) to be slightly closer to the market. What's the market? For buyers, it's the ask price. For sellers, it's the bid price.

Yes, for a day order, which is the default, if it is not filled it will be automatically canceled. But don't wait a whole day for an order to fill. Ten seconds is plenty.

Yeah ok, you're from the future and you're talking about the past in your timeline. Got it.  


Yeah you do have a point, it was kind of negative. I apologize for that. I just didn't see how GME would supply any type of electronics imaginable. They won't be competing with digikey and mouser, or parts express. But I have bought electronics from them recently.  


I don't even understand what "amazon of electronics" means except for hyping a meme. How are they going to compete with amazon?

:(
Check with a broker - call Fidelity or your bank if they offer a ROTH. I'm pretty sure you can contribute your gains to a ROTH. The ROTH limits are caps not minimums.  

But I suggest using a broker instead if you want to trade stocks in the account.

Look at OSTK last year from the end of June to August.
Hypothetically what would happen if every single person that owned GME stock put in a sell order with a limit price of like $200?

As brokers force people to close short positions, they would be forced to buy at $200 right?

I have never tried trading before at all, watched the WSB page for awhile and put $500 on RH a month ago, currently at 925. I think knowing to take profits even if you missed the top is the only reason I keep going up.
If you are in this for the long term and want to trade as a business they are incredible. I was with them for 6 months and learned a lot! Remember it‚Äôs tailored to safe trading over a long career. No low float penny stocks. 

I would start with the chat room only. They bring different folks on the mic all day and you can learn so much in if you have the time.
Buy them while you canüöÄüöÄ
I'm not sure what you mean by "a mini Tesla of the hydrogen world". A sleeper value buy? An over-valued meme stock? This phrase is rooted in your opinion of Tesla which I can't determine one way or the other.

I would not invest in a company without understanding the fundamentals of their service. Tesla makes sense because batteries+car manufacturing a both well established industries that happen to work well together right now.

Hydrogen is a different industry all-together. From my technical perspective hydrogen has no future. You can find dissenting opinions though.

 It is less energy efficient than pure electric and has the same overhead limitations that traditional petrol has. It also will never be truly renewable like electric power. It relies on other actual renewable technologies in order to *seem* renewable. The hype will die.

Will they corner the hydrogen market? I don't think so. It's possible with enough investment though. Old hydrogen production methods are vastly more cost effective albeit polluting. They won't be going away anytime soon.
INVEST NOW!!!
PLTR Cathie approved
STOP THE COUNT BIDEN
He doesn‚Äôt even know what he is saying
NAH VALE, MT, CLF
Yeah I don‚Äôt know but my take is if they offer shares but it‚Äôs nowhere enough for covering it doesn‚Äôt change the short squeeze thesis and provides GME with extra cash so it strengthens their position.
#FUCK
Man I need to learn how to buy shorts. Anyone have recommendations on where to learn?
Facebook
This is the way
Confirmed?
What happens to PLTR?
wait biden why are u crash mkt
So mine isn‚Äôt settled yet, so I‚Äôm not sure if I can use margin even tbh. I‚Äôll have to check tomorrow after I close positions. It‚Äôs probbaly have to be settled tho tbh

My guess is that a lot of people are having the same thoughts as you - taking GME profits and dumping them into BB. You could lead the charge. Sell half your GME and toss it in to BB.
Bring back Trump, this grandpa fucking sucks
Futures why you red
is it too late to get in?
Just said, Clean Battery Tech, AI, Solar, and future energy all in the same sentence.
calls never expire on monday.
I sold $32 for next week. I‚Äôm worried.
I can confirm I shorted at 42.70 and covered at 41.30 to keep bulls from getting paid on their $40 calls

Just stop. He‚Äôs not going to dump his 6 months of income into otm TSLA calls no matter how hard you yikes at him.
" everyone will pay their fair share " - Futures be like fuuuuck that
Lol, I sold those 55 calls that expire tomorrow. And, if they print for you, I‚Äôll be cheering with you because it was a covered call sale. So, if it prints, it means my shares will have jumped from $19 a few days ago to over $55 by EOD tomorrow, and I‚Äôm good with that!!

So, here‚Äôs to those 55s printing for you tomorrow!!

I‚Äôd feel safer with BB at this point.

But what do I know? I‚Äôm just as retarded as every other person here.
I only started in August and I'm up 36% but I'm mostly just lucky that I bought some TSLA. Just focus on something like SPY and let time do the work, pick something odd and fun when you have the chance imo.

Nah I work for my gf‚Äôs family
Premium - $.10 (fee you pay, each contract is for the rights to buy 100 shares at the strike price so $.10 x 100 means this call will cost you $10.00)

Stock price - $8 (what the price of the stock currently is when you)

Strike price - $6 (where you think the price will go)

Stock price - (Strike price + premium) = $1.9

$1.9 x 100 = $190.  So this makes you $190, if the price didn't exceed the break even point (strike price + premium = break even point, $6 + $.1 = $6.10 in this instance) by the time the option expires your option is worthless and you're out the $10 premium.  I think that's it, maybe I'm retarded.

Can someone explain the catalyst for this moon mission?
Oh for sure.  But there's also the problem that people who legit rely on food pantries have to deal with whatever crap gets donated, which is often cheap and shitty.  It's a god damn mess out there.  People need to be responsible for what they shove into their faces, and healthier food needs to be more attainable to make it more attractive.

no it doesn't work like that. They'll use stocks bought by margin accounts by borrowing the stocks

There‚Äôs only one house. 

And the 50/50 split in the senate has questionable roots. Lots of moderates on both sides of the aisle.

It might turn out to be a helluva fight for Biden Admin to get much passed in the next 12 months
GME, PLTR and APHA after hours make it seem like covid got cured already. Is that not accurate?
HE SAID CLEAN ENERGY AGAIN
It isn't only about money its about treating the people who work for you decently. NOONE can survive off 10$ an hr. We subsidized those wages, it's literally socialism for companies that refuse to pay a living wage. Maybe those business owners should make a sacrifice and not only worship money.
Yes
Lol that‚Äôs exactly my fees bro. Makes me want to cash out 20% and go full retard. Instead Last 3 days while I‚Äôve been on ‚Äúbreak‚Äù I‚Äôm about flat lol.

God dammit. Stop talking like that. Its annoying as fuck
Papa Joe and Aunt Cathie are going to make us rich
Maybe. It depends what the Chewy crew can come up with and execute. The potential is there in a growing $200 billion per year industry. The parallels to Blockbuster are apt, but we may see what Blockbuster COULD have been as Cohen is the type of leader that Blockbuster needed toward the end.
24% of every single Us Dollar created ever was printed in the last year.

Value stocks perform better in high inflation periods and growth stocks perform better during low inflation. When inflation is on the upswing, income-oriented or high-dividend-paying stock prices generally decline. Stocks overall do seem to be more volatile during highly inflationary periods.

It‚Äôs very rare that the sale price of the options would be less than exercising and selling the stock. That would be the only time exercising would make more sense than selling the contracts. You just sell the option contracts to close it out and take the profit. In this case the option contracts should be trading at $10 or higher (likely higher since even on expiration day there is a small amount of IV).

Biden just said $15 minimum wage. Who‚Äôs going to make the kiosk that will be replacing the high school kids at McDonald‚Äôs and the grocery store?  If they‚Äôre publicly traded, calls will print.
DAMN SON, WHERE‚ÄôD YOU FIND THIS?!
C mom old man, show us your 2003 blackberry so it can go to $20
BB time or not this time? 

again and again, I know, but this time, I think I may feel a real disruption in the force, and you?

The word Bigly doesn't even come close to what we're about to experience with GME tomorrow. Stratospheric, interstellic, celestial, are all within reach in comparison...GME is going further. BEYOND our galaxy. Unlike anything the modern market has every witnessed. The power that GME has buried deep in its loins surpasses even that of the sun itself. The greatest transfer of wealth is upon us.

YOUR NEXT STOCK... EXPR had highest volume is HISTORY today and broke a 3 year trend 

You want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money
You should probably try and max out your retirement options/accounts and boomer them. I‚Äôve had a separate fun money account that I‚Äôve put something into every month since I was 18 to do whatever. Of course my tax obligation is full there. However one of the things I regret the most is also boomering that account t and being afraid of taking profits because of the tax obligation. Now that I‚Äôm 40 it could have been a lot bigger if I wasn‚Äôt long on everything in there forever. 

This is not financial advice.
Got into FB at 260 and I had seen it hold that level (200 day average) a couple of times to bounce back to mid 270's.

I got in  this time so it had to go down. Added some more today at 246. Slowly nibbling and doing DCA....near term believe it will go lower.  Low 200's will be a steal.

Big tech hasn't moved much ..a correction and everything will get hit some more whether they rallied or not.

No get half your position at open and wait 30 minutes to see if sells off a bit and then go all in.
Lol, this is why I'm not selling. Unlike other short squeeze there's plenty of shares with low borrowing fees to kill a rally. GME? It's on Hard-To-Borrow for months on end with insanely high fees with very low liquidity/insane bid-ask prices, super low float.

Also Melvin looking to wind 72m shares of 69.5m outstanding lol. People looking to short for pennies in front of Melvin stampeding out the door as soon as the door creaks open.

Agreed. But the only lesson OP still hasn‚Äôt learned is to tame is arrogance and confidence. He still believes that he‚Äôs going to be the one in that small percentage that actually becomes a millionaire doing this. 

It takes a lot of effort to not have made money during thhe last 8 months. Even if you put a cat to pick random stocks you would have performed better than op.

He would be better off putting money on index funds.
How do you find the key levels. Like you talked about 37 was a key level for gme

1.9M should be how much they own before today, I think it takes them a few days to update that list
I see.  Interesting.

1. I hope you didn‚Äôt sell between now and when you wrote the message, because it‚Äôs up to 1.85.  Cheers!

2. My advice is to take 1/2 now and immediately plan the price levels that you‚Äôll take the rest at.  If I were you, I‚Äôd keep cutting it in half every time it gains 50 cents.  So, half now, half of the remainder at $2.5, half of that at $3.00... etc 

3. As a profitable day trader, I can‚Äôt suggest strongly enough that you only enter into a trade when you have a clear strategy that details what you‚Äôll do in every possible outcome. If you want to trade actively and aggressively, that will be necessary for success.

4. Check out the SPACs attack show on YouTub by Benzinga.  It‚Äôs live every weekday at 8 AM and all of the past episodes are recorded. That‚Äôs a great way to stay up-to-date on news and they also give basic Strategic advice.

Congrats on your early success

They don‚Äôt need to compete with Amazon, a company valued at like 600x what GME is valued at, that is obviously an over exaggeration, but Amazon is sketchy for buying electronics, it‚Äôs a big opportunity, especially if GME shifts more into selling high quality PC‚Äôs and monitors which are typically not bought from stores with brand recognition, that could be a huge market for them.   Given their tiny market cap all they have to do is be decently profitable and grow their e-commerce sales and the stock will continue to rise

I am really interested in watching anything e-commerce related over the next three years. Companies like Shopify, DocuSign and Chewy have all thrived during this down time for most businesses.
Cathie bought
Do it Biden you corrupt fuck! POP THIS FUCKING BUBBLE you bag of bones!! Pop it bitch
 it was luck  honestly if you look at his op he had plenty of 2019 calls that were worthless
  Cathie bought more SRPT again üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ
Republicans will vote yes on this
Exactly!
/v/ - The Musical

Now has a sister record.

/wsb/ - The Musical


Oh shi-
*started
Joe just whispered and said ‚Äúbuy ICLN‚Äù
ARK bought some
Sounds good, thanks for the help stranger! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
I guarantee some new accounts will appear, use some gamer words and the sub will get banned for 'hate speech'. What is going on here will not be allowed much longer.
Nah he literally mentioned them lol
Why didn't Cathie wait til Feb to buy PLTR at 20 instead?
My personal opinion is that this is such a complicated issue, and if Tencent is forced to divest then that's kinda "nationalizing" US (gaming) companies, and because of the complexity, risk to US companies, and optics, the status quo will remain
BACK TO BACK GREEN FRIDAYS??
I need MORE
For those that say we are only down .1%, please remember most of this subreddit is leveraged to the tits and a .5% retracement will lead to half this sub filing for bankruptcy
Only panic sellers will sell on this tax increase statement. 

Tax rates are set til 2022
They already had a few million..
So what should be the full play?
All monies moving to meme stonks
So fucking what? Isn‚Äôt it arguably blood money?
I have 18x PLTR 29c that I bought for 0.06 each. You‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a chance?
Everyone's pretty arrogant at 18 tbf
BB, BBBY, GME all up at least $1 AH. ICLN up $0.20 ü§°
Anyone else have people telling them to start pulling out of their GME shares for RiSk MaNaGeMeNt? Fuck. That. üíéüôåüò§
Fucking legend
Joe Buyden says he lovessss anaconda steel
You know politics work in the us? they literally do. It needs 60 votes in the senate to pass. So some gop will have to be on board but it‚Äôll get done
I love you GME
Who has more shares of PLTR

WSB  or Cathy ?
I wish $40-$50. More realistically: $25 :-(  
Screw it $60 EOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  üöÄüöÄüöÄ  üöÄüöÄüöÄ  üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Say green energy one more time. 3 times the charm papa Buyden
ok but who produces semiconductor?
Someone run out on stage and shoot him in the ass with an epi pen. Then run backstage as fast as you can waving your hands in the air
Yea one of the tickers on that list is a ‚Äòbanned wsb ticker‚Äô whatever that means so I cropped it out.
MagiKarp money shots!
Taxes to build up our country‚Äôs infrastructure
Far as I understood with calls and merger acquisitions, your options expire as they are - so if they are out the money, they expire worthless and if they are in the money, you get compensated by the ITM value.


Unfortunately for most of WSB including myself, our calls were likely OTM, so I believe the market just terminates them. 


One day after my DD, this happens. I shared my position and included that I was burned for the January calls, and now February due to the acquisition happening at a lightning's notice, though it was expected to be well past inauguration and waiting on Australia's decisions.

Either way, lost $1000 on this and will look to my next play. Up big on Blackberry and Steel, should be other things to look out for in the near future.
Yep. The whole market.
Those 2 sectors plus cannabis have alot of growth.  Arkg and crispr is is the biggest advancement since antibiotics were discovered!
Who‚Äôs gonna hold $BB over weekend ??
Biden: We will close tax loopholes!

The Market: Oh HELL no!

Yes
It's 55 celcius in my pants when I'm looking at this.
In at $34 and planning to hold long term.
16K is well in the ballpark of solid gains friend! Obviously right now GME is kinda inflating gains on the sub. But not bad at all! üëè
shares.
I‚Äôm comfy
lol he said get rid of tax loopholes and make top fortune 500 companies pay taxes 

THE YEAR OF THE DRILL IS UPON US
UESSIR
THE WILL MUST BE DEMONSTRATED
Nice work. I bought the drop today.  Is this shit on Apple Music or Spotify yet?
sorry for the random thread bump..but can you explain why OP is stuck? I get that OP is only receiving a tiny amount of credit every time they roll, but isn't the point that the underlying is rapidly appreciating behind all this rolling?

So they still get to ride the underlying going up while still collecting a tiny credit as a bonus, is this correct?
I'll be honest. I never actually believed this speech would pump the market.

I just told people it would so they would FOMO into TICKERS that may help my positions üêçüêçüêç
A lot of options expired today. I can imagine a spike tomorrow, demo day & earnings. Lockup should be negligible unless retail panics. Godspeed
You‚Äôre pathetic
TLRY APHA BB MOONING WTF
Why ARKs?
Imagine Cathie bought PTLR to distract us from GME
Agreed.

The whole thread seemed off.

It definitely ‚Äòpumped‚Äô 

Power of Reddit to move markets.

Hell, Kramer is basically a WSB retread at this point. Not surprised others are trying to influence markets through Reddit threads.
On the stock app thing
Hello yes dis is FBI
üöÄ‚Äî-> ü™ê
Take that to the bank $$$
kathy
Lol. Were you here during the first weeks of the pandemic? Every Trump speech was exciting. Not only would he rais SPY by 20 points for about an hour every time, but then he'd have some off-the-rails conversations.

I will miss having a prez that will answer any question even if he has no idea wtf he's talking about
What was it?
ARKW	01/14/2021	Buy	PLTR	69608A108	PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES 497,100
YOUR NEXT STOCK... EXPR had highest volume is HISTORY today and broke a 3 year trend 

You want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money
Here
Hands down funniest quote of the year:

&#x200B;

>"We will be responsible with taxpayer money" - Biden said tonight
Why does he whisper like that
They will because consumer buying power will be hire so they can charge more. Duh.
BB! BB! BB!
I am with you
He could still buy more shares with all that cash. Maybe he will if the stock ever dips significantly?
honestly, as minimum wage has been increasing in my province, 90% of micdicks and walmart have become self serve
this....  THIS!!!  FUCK AM I AMPED NOW!  LETS BURN CITI TO THE GROUND!  ARGGGHHHHHH!
No, been a long time associate and have been saying this for years
I just find Mark Cuban annoying in general. He knows just enough about everything to form a shitty argument.
LMND... Citron back at it again with a BS claim!
This guy can use $100 as toilet paper
Joe ‚ÄúGUH‚Äù Biden
fair point
Its not, and the bear cases I read tend to mistake the companies identity and understate its potential. I research many meme stocks that get mentioned here but genuinely believe SQ is different. Its my biggest holding for a reason.
Cmon Joey I have 8k in 1dte SPY calls, pump this shit!
But people arent supposed to work minimum wage. Its for entry level jobs and stuents but some people just dont want to advance with their career or make themselves unable to. This will cause inflation and make it worse for everyone. In the long run, the 15/hr will be redundant once the price of everything goes up.
I long for forgetting about what the president is doing every day.
Maybe try this dip
I think this is why it‚Äôs up 5% AH
$GME - media attention phase of your average bubble. Still tons of room to run.
"Quick let's sell and accelerate a taxable event!"
I didn‚Äôt and I am so fuck u
Biden needs to say his new limo is made by Tesla
Yes
Let‚Äôs get these gains
im so retarded   robinhood literally gave me a free share of a bed bath and beyond at 3.90 and now its at 28.54 . Should of listened to robinhood and gone in for the yolo
Can someone explain what happened here? I'm really new to investing and am really confused to what he did here. Did he basically pay $785k of shares and due to GME blowing up, his return was over $7 million?
ARKQ and ARKW hold a combined $110 million in shares. ARQX will also hold NNDM. This stock could very likely mirror what DDD is doing. Every offering the stock bounces back and then adds some momentum.
Either y‚Äôall‚Äôs charts are lagging or mine are.  I‚Äôm seeing spy futures at 3794 on a bounce
Bloomberg‚Äôs 2020 stock picker of the year going hard in the fucking paint on PLTR, ~500,000 shares
If the Palantir calls I bought for $2 and $3 as a joke actually pan out I‚Äôll let my wife‚Äôs boyfriend play on the Nintendo switch tonight üôå
What is?
Is that a bad thing?
ENKS  My mom is on the line
HYSR  sold my cat for this one

That‚Äôs why your wife has a bf. you don‚Äôt know what hard means
GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS
Poetry! Congrats man!
That can always be changed by congress
i got two of those
BB probably
What's your reasoning?
Im long AF on many things. I just hedged because it was obvious we go down tomorrow.
I'm gonna lose a lot of money tomorrow
Biden to announce separate stimulus dedicated entirely to purchasing printers
I did for this week but, I am reluctant to sell any for next week.
I bought mine to close mid day and that after hours move feels absolutely great now that I'm safe.
Not sure if $30 is OTM enough at this point for next week.
I think we might have finally made a decent break from the wedge.
She saved my ass on SPCE üöÄüöÄ
Lets get PLTR parabolic numb nuts üöÄüöÄüöÄüåö
Read and decide of you are long term or short term investor.
Or watch the video. I except more videos to come out soon.
But im sire it will pas the 2$ mark tomorrow. Next week is gonna run as well.
What article retard?
Gonna switch to shares and I‚Äôll hold I guess
I was told red days were illegal
Cathie
Queen Cathie bought tons of shares. Thank god too, saved my 1/15 calls
Dude fuck yeah, new lawyer here, 160k debt, just started trading, working up the bankroll to one day make a yolo to freedom

Anyone think they‚Äôll actually pass a $15 an hour minimum wage?
I need SPY to open at like $400
Fucking joe just tryin to fuk all our calls
Yes
It‚Äôs a REAL good news not just some worthless contract
Thanks man
Why is that despite your wins you keep on thinking about the plays you did not make. Been watching GM and Citibank like a hawk for a month. The options were 5 to 10 baggers
G‚Äôs ready to be dropped at open üòç
Lmaoooooo those ppl asking questions
Pltr
So he doesn‚Äôt fumble his words
imagine not knowing buzzword means
Goodnight Joe. Have sweet dreams!
Does pre-market trading pick up at the same price after-hours ended at? Or does it pick up at where the market closed?  Trying to decide if it's best to take a huge loss in a short right now or roll the dice in pre-market
What the fuck did she do? I was just worried about my put credit spread going worthless.
I've been trying to keep up this past few weeks but I'm way too retarded for this. Should I buy calls right now or straight up put $1K on a limit order for tommorow?
6 months LOL.  $15-20 EOM.
so when do we get stimmy for more stonks
Wow that's it. Bulls fked
THE TROOPS? WHAT ABOUT ICLN
Harris going to give Biden a blowy
Gees Up.

PLTR!!! üìàüìàüìàüìàüìàüìà
What do you mean when you say call? I‚Äôm still trying to learn all the different phrases used in this sub
Super boring and I‚Äôm here for it üöÄ
never would happen, unless campaign donations were restricted, and the revolving door between the fox and the hen house (industry, and government regulators) were closed.
Cathie bought in
Some guy‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs friend who works on wall street I read on a yahoo message board
That‚Äôs it???
This is awesome! PLTR is by far my largest holding: thank you for this confirmation bias.
Regardless his boomer brain will not compute.

fuck pj traders panicking because he said ''taxes'' cmon people, he's giving away so much free money, don't be so greedy
Lol
MMs don't like Biden :o
ICLN ü§§
For sure man always have them in my portfolio
he literally said this is a time for insert(every ark industry)
It's a horrible mistake for our economy since that money is literally being misused (like the $10 Pakistani gender studies fund snuck into the last one) and everyone who gets it will be spending it on useless stuff, like T.V.s. 

For those of us who are investing, it's only going to pad our portfolios and hopefully give us a means to keep our heads above water when things crash hard.
PLTR mooning after hours ü§£
If he was investing 800k he was probably fine before and this extra few mill isn't a big deal
TO THE MOON!!!
That $15/hr will be the same as $7.50/hr eoy
Up 5% after hours
Bet
Don't care ban him
I‚Äôm an independent but futes would be soaring if the other guy made this speech
PLTR moon mission resumes tomorrow. See what Cathie does to stocks she takes positions in. üöÄüöÄüöÄ
You don‚Äôt even know how hurt I am for selling my free PLUG shares at $4
worth 3k tomorrow morning
Only mentioned clean energy once, what a bitcch
As soon as they finalize its booming. I think 50 by end of summer, just need to figure how to make the most amount of money from it
????????????????????
Or don‚Äôt work for the waltons
Biden is like EOW peace out
May be PLTR day
132-135 with a Feb expiry
You sold me.... I will be rolling over my 1/15 calls tomorrow into 1/29 calls.... Already got a bag of 1/22 calls....
Can‚Äôt believe Biden just shilled ARK and ICLN.  üòÇüò≠
Thanks man. Dammit.
ArkInvest ( $ARKW) bought half a million shares of $PLTR. We pumping tomorrow boys.
At least trump answered questions. Dude had the slickest tongue in the game
Wrekt :(
Yessir
omg bro it popped hard
Together, together we can cause the GME short squeeze and create a crisis for Melvin and üåàüêª.
Is our president a closet bear?
Gooooooo PLTR
Boo! Trump would have answered your stupid questions!
ICLN taking off
GME üöÄüöÄüöÄ
But a large amount of the shares can‚Äôt be sold in the short term because they are held by insiders or large institutions that hold for their passive ETFs. So doesn‚Äôt that magnify the problem for Melvin and all other shorts?
LOL FORGOT HIS MASK
But how long!
Trump makes me sleepy too
When NET tanks at open, I‚Äôm just gonna blame Joe.

Biden literally didn't say shit
HE DID NOT SAY MARIJUANA
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
She bought like 500k shares
That's it?!
Wtf kind of speech was that
my mind is a Sine graph trying to follow these double negatives
He needed to say clean energy some more üò§üò§
ICLN PUMPING
Lmao I heard that too
He left because he has to go see how much he made off his gme gains
To be fair, the bar is pretty low right now
BIDON THE DEATH BY DAWN
Guys, He has been secretly talking about GME all this time. "We need to save failing american businesses", who the fuck do you think this means? Buy more and do your part, buyden will do his.
There are opportunities add more along the way as they describe in the article
I was really hoping he would say he was gonna continue to defer student loan payments and interest so I can keep throwing my payment into my trading account. Don‚Äôt judge me.
What does 55c mean?
Why does Harris even come out?
I think most of the new stuff is short term trading, day trading, swing trading...not true investing...they‚Äôll be in and out and mostly out...
Sleepy Joe
mine are all green...
Good idea.  This is a decent size cap.  Will check it out.  
Thanks for putting on some credible links.
I heard that
PLTR or nndm
Holy shit PLTR liked something Biden said
I bought that. Those drops never last
Forgot his mask, puts on Biden
Cramer you just showed your hand. Nice!  We are not at all surprised by the username though, you could've hidden yourself better.
Lmao people asking questions and he be like noooooope
It‚Äôs a done deal
nice dude what exp date
Damn he didn‚Äôt say Tesla once...
Exactly
Is the brick wall behind Biden because its being filmed in his basement?
facts what a fuckhead
Tomorrow is PLTR day... When the fuck Cathy is going to buy RKT :(
ccp upvoting every biden comment
This is going to trigger such a squeeze on PLTR. LEGEND CATHIE
Expiration date? 1/15 ?
 PLTR mooning??
Hey retards stop buying PLTR now. I need to load at 25 SHARP!!!!
So Biden's package contains a lot: [https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/politics/biden-economic-rescue-package-coronavirus-stimulus/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/politics/biden-economic-rescue-package-coronavirus-stimulus/index.html)

But notably, it includes an increase to the minimum wage to $15/hour (not a surprise that Democrats would push for this, but it was not expected in this bill). Obviously some companies won't like this (though others that rely more on consumer spending without minimum wage workers will like it) and it also makes the bill much more difficult to pass. Some say it's a poison pill. We'll see.
This man sounds like an angel after dealing with Trump for 4 years
Lol. Shit...My 1/15 $55cc might actually sell üòß
Fucking dude forgot to take his mask....
At least trump was entertaining
Bring back mango man

Oh you misunderstood.. I'm still holding lmaooo
Wagering my first born on BUS
Thank you for your sacrifice
Is he not strong enough to answer questions?
Imagine calling a $15 minimum living wage a poison pill.
Still, I bet it could be challenging cashflow-wise for many, as I'd imagine the mortgage would account for a significant portion of salaries at the time. Or were salaries truly inflation adjusted in those days (unlike today)?
Yes sir. Do you have any recommendations on where I can the knowledge required to go in on calls? Maybe Youtube videos?
50? I'd do it for a two bagger
u/savevideo
Biden is outlining why growth stocks time is over. The rotation to value is starting. BUY **LOWE'S!**
I just heard Joe lowkey market signal Artificial Intelligence along with all the predictable alt energy stuff.

What are y'alls favorite AI industry picks?
Mine was X at around $5.
% in the portfolio
That gives ME confidence... sweet thanks for the confirmation bias
Uh.. spy ah tanking after that speech....
No questions allowed. Lol
I agree about MA crossovers... pretty beginner friendly. I don‚Äôt think VWAP is relevant until your account is past the PD rule level, but, hey, to each their own.
It won't matter inflation is getting soo bad it's not gonna make a difference
Well tomorrow is going to suck
Stay on here and look for hyped stocks that seem to have a legitimate reason for big growth in the short term due to a deal, new  product, earnings report, whatever, get in early and try to avoid hopping onto things a day or days after it has been hyped to death. There is a lot more lee way for bad decisions when you get in early.
I am so confused by this meme.  Why not just use options profit calculator
1/15s?
Well that was nothing new. He just made an announcement about future announcements. Did I miss anything?

Appreciate the advice.  Yes this completely makes sense.  Would this be considered a "pump and dump"?

This was my first year of trading, and I'm learning a lot of lessons the hard way, but at least I was smart enough to only invest a small amount at the beginning and increase my investment slowly over time.  I finished the year with a fairly high growth percentage for 2020, but more importantly I remember most of the lessons I learned.

I've also gotten tuned into some genuine mentors and teachers whos advice has actually panned out consistently for me in the real world.

I think I'm on the right track, but very thankful I didn't take a misstep here and get hooked up with Mr. Brown.

Thanks again!  Happy trading ü§ôüèΩ

Cliched garbage speech. All he was missing was ‚Äú...and maybe, just maybe...we can fix this mess.‚Äù
So I sold my GME when it hit 36 so im üìúüëê as fuck but from what ive seen it has serious reason to stand in the 40-50 range short term and long term it will continue rising as daddy RC changes the company. BB went brrr today I think due to the news of it selling patents, gettin some sweet cash to pay off debt with. Im rotating to BB but my largest position is PLTR.

YOUR NEXT STOCK... EXPR had highest volume is HISTORY today and broke a 3 year trend 

You want to know the next BIG stock its EXPRESS clothing it's one of the most beaten down retail stocks and people search for "Express clothing" at 3.5x the rate they search "Gucci clothing". My guess is that its beaten down because people think it won't survive I say no this is a company that has well distinguished itself on the internet and will be great in the future. and it has a 60m float like cmon this is easy money

Sounds like what you are describing is as the price runs up towards a big OI strike the increasing delta of the short options getting hedged accelerates the move and causes bigger more volatile swings.

at above 7% or so you are considered to be "beating the market" as the snp500 has an average growth of around that per year.

$100 end of year without the squeeze. With the squeeze I‚Äôm not sure. Tomorrow we have 50k put contacts expiring and 400 million worth of call options that will be exercised if the price ends above $45. That alone could rocket us up to 50+ early next week. Then if short positions start covering $100+ doesn‚Äôt seem too off. Time line for that Depends on how long the shorts want to stave off the inevitable

> When calculating your max return on investment when selling a cash secured Put, do you use the full collateral as the denominator or do you use the collateral less the premium earned?

For ROC, the full collateral alone.

FWIW, I prefer to use my early exit loss target, because I'm not going to risk the entire collateral if I can help it. Since less cash is nominally at risk, using the full collateral understates return. So I use the max loss I'm willing to accept on the position before I early exit. That's usually around 20% of the credit collected plus fees/expenses.

> Also, how do you calculate ROI on covered calls?

(*Realized* credit + gains on the shares) / net cost basis of the shares.

Using the initial credit collected overstates the return. It's better to wait until the CC is resolved (for example, you close the short call at 50% of max profit), then calculate your ROI. Gains on the shares may be negative (a loss) if the credit is positive.
I personally dont think premium cost is worth the risk. So I'd buy shares.  [ivs ](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/trading-weekly-options/9781118727386/OEBPS/9781118727386_epub_c_06.htm)

You're a mad man! Congratulations
the year how can I avoid the short term capital gains tax?

Example purchase 

Jan 1 2020 - $5000 company xyz purchase 
Feb 28 2020 - $5000 company xyz purchase
June 1 2020 - $5000 company xyz purchase 
August 1 2020 - $5000 company xyz purchase. 

Total 2020 returns - 100%. 
Account balance - 40k

I‚Äôm assuming I could sell 5k now and it would be considered long term gains and taxed accordingly. 

When does the additional 20k in move from short term to long term?

Is the profit on each of the 4 purchases tracked with that individual purchase or would I have to wait to take any profits until August 1?

Hope this makes sense.
Depends on how the money gets spent
Futures are red after Buyden just told us we all getting stimmies, we are Fuk

Large institutional investor ARKW just bought  just bought 500k shares of PLTR today
Biden said buy $TLRY that‚Äôs how you‚Äôll get the stimmy
FUCK ARE FUTES GOING DOWN BC BIDEN SAID TAXES
Yes
Whys Monday Market off?  New here too !
Some dude called this the next ten bagger a week ago. If he did right, he's a millionaire now.
Oh shit! Missed that
Damn bro you sound like you hangout on stocktwits too much. Cringe as fuck
I wish, he has a better position than me haha.
Buy 20x BB 22/1c for $7.50 at 1.85 premium and just exercise them?? Seeing all the hype, what say retards? Or just buy shares in the morning?
Was anything interesting mentioned?
It was at 32.75
That was extremely smol pp energy 

Hence why the majority are thrilled with it!
ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø you absolute mad lad. Well deserved. So happy for you. I wish to join you one day in Valhalla m'lord. üôè

I thought I read one of the first things he was gonna do once he got into office was extend the loan payment pause

[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loan-payments-pause-biden-extend/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loan-payments-pause-biden-extend/)
This is what tech gets for sucking Biden off. Here you go fuckers. He turned around and fucked you.
If you‚Äôre not all in GME you‚Äôre a joke
Student loan interest/payments will probably get pushed back to September

Getting rid of any student loan debt is so far down the list of things needed lol
I dunno, the bumbling idiot was more entertaining than the puppet
Seems like only 10k will be relieved in his 2nd relief package. However, he can use the treasury to relieve all of it by executive order...so we‚Äôll see if he gets pressured to do it.
I think if he learned to YOLO small amounts (100 bucks on a contract on a solid thesis) he would learn to not sell immediately at the first sign of normal intraday volatility. I bet he uses all his day trades up fucking selling at a $20 loss.
That robot already exists. No joke.
Yes
Miss him
never too late to buy a crystal ball
She knows they won‚Äôt sell.

No position here, hoping that some of them do...
Yes
Have people been banning those who are doing this? Just curious.
What happened w sleepy Joe speech?

The option writer is probably absolutely shitting themselves right now.

How are we going to fund this $2T package?

Let me tell you about a stock ticker GME and the capital gains taxes from it
My dad retired from 28 years in the Air Force. He does inventory at Wal-Mart 4 days a week and loves it. Works before most other workers/customers get there in a small team. He also gets joy by bothering his HR department about every overreach or stupid thing his bosses do.

He 100% doesn't need the job but really likes the physical and social aspect of getting up and going in to work.
Hello sir, this is James with the SEC. do you have a minute to chat?
Cramer said today that the shorts are still at 140% ( where do they see this total they keep spouting?  I can only find daily info ).
Where are you guys reading that Ark bought more PLTR? I own a shit ton of shares and was baffled by AH.
Ok bootlicker
Best of luck bro, friday will be good to us I hope.

I have no idea.. Ive been shitting on GME for the last 2 months, but decided to hop on when it was like $18.

Now that I've made quite a bit on it, Im just gonna follow DFV and do whatever he does. He seems to know his shit, and it looks like he doesn't plan on it stopping. Especially if there's a short squeeze.
Say now chad how do I find this rawdit on my smarty phone?

Thanks for filling in some the back story. If he was indeed fired for violating a policy before it was policy then that doesn't seem fair to him.

My comment was mainly to highlight that the gender of the employee wasn't relevant. One of my pet peeves is when people use the word female to describe people when it really isn't germane to the point. For example if someone said  "I was pulled over by a female police officer for speeding!" What does it matter that the police officer was a woman? Why do I need to know that?

Sorry for the rant :).
I‚Äôm still pissed about it
I'm bearish on PLTR but might play some 0DTE calls tomorrow. ARK just bought half a million shares

ARKW 01/14/2021 Buy PLTR PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC 497,1000
I mean I‚Äôm retarded so what I say doesn‚Äôt matter but I get the vibe that the market was kiiiiinda hoping for a massive fuckin package with a blue senate. $1.9T with absolutely nothing retroactive is probably a let down to a lot of people lol

I don't understand fully why, but apparently options aren't a great choice right now just because of the IV. That being said, I still bought a Jan22 $30c for 2.5 a share because i personally think that'll print.

It means 55 calls which is like ur betting the stock will go beyond 55$ at a certain date.
I want you to be right so bad

Any one have more detail on the Cali Supreme Court ruling today on gig workers rights? I saw they ruled in favor of them but can‚Äôt find anymore info. 

And more specially why did dash boost in AH on what should be bad news for them, fucking POS.
>  Roughly half of the companies in there would be expected to outperform the s&p, over any given period

Not accurate. Most gains are from a handful of companies at any given time. We often have situations where S&P 500 goes up while 400 of the companies underperform it.
Live stream??
Didn‚Äôt they already have shares? Or is this the first time?

Fuck I wish I grabbed these instead of shares today. I was thinking about it but had to leave for school so said fuck it and bought some shares to be safe.
Why is everyone hypung clean energy? You retards cant understand that its bullish AF for oil??

Yes!!! I've been so focused on GME today I went to look at a few of my other holdings and saw I'm up for the day on PLTR like $500? Wha? 

Cathie is the straw that stirs the drink baby!
Can't believe he was on time. Fuckin nutty skill move I haven't seen from a president in years.
There are a lot of people that are anti Amazon. How often do you come across a Nintendo store or a Sony store? The physical locations also drive up a demand for online purchases. And if those other companies decided too, they would probably make a bunch of money by selling their merchandise through a GameStop store, be it online or in a physical store. GameStop is like a staple gaming shop. I‚Äôm not saying that the other businesses wouldn‚Äôt be better. All I‚Äôm saying is GameStop has potential for growth especially after falling so low.
APHA is at a serious discount now. Why would anyone buy Tilray at this point!?

I'm hoping to hold out until the merger is finalized and APHA shares are converted to Tilray to capitalize on the current APHA discount. Hopefully, it can hang on that long and keep rising!

I really hope msft tanks after earnings again and then goes flat for a few days, I need a 10 bagger with those calls
It needs to stay above $1 for a while or face delisting so there's that

None of this was news. It leaked publicly at least an hour before he spoke

So did sleepy Joe cuck our calls for tomorrow or what?
That seemed like a whole lot of nothing but do we think ICLN will pump tomorrow or nah
Isn't their cheapest vehicle going to be like $80,000?

Today was a red day I thought. Everything I own was red except for ARKK and so was the S&P 500 and QQQ.
How
obviously. fire them and hire new ones.
Reverse that last thought for the coming week and then roll into PLTR after squeeze
Where??
She's adding meme stocks. We are in control.
It pisses me off that Biden doesn‚Äôt make my calls his first priority. He works for me damnit

> 50% upside for GME

IMHO this severely underestimates the remaining upside if a true squeeze happens now that the shorts are fully locked in (with new friends) and not exits are left.   

Exhibit A:  https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1349435914632749058
What broker is this?
Market is bullish but... USD plummeting, inflation....
Futures going red is fine - probably for the best. Means the open market will be very green.
Good thing the only calls I got today was APHA
Cathy! My pltr calls thank you
How much more will GME go up?
APHA leaps better retirement plan than vtsax
If I wasn‚Äôt all in on Fitbit calls I would

Yeah they are pretty sketchy, I try to always stick with shipped and sold by amazon. Hell, I recently bought SSDs on amazon, and whoever has the 3070 in stock without the ridiculous upsell is getting the business. Probably will be Amazon.  


But if you look and best buy, newegg, walmart, probably tiger direct, they all have "marketplace" items and shipped and sold by them items.  


If GME goes this route then you're still dealing with sketchy electronic purchases.  


I used to buy my computer components at Fry's Electronics. Now they're basically trash. If GME is trying to sell computer parts or prebuilts they're competing with already established brands like newegg, tiger direct, ibuypower, maingear, orgin, cyber power, etc etc.
God damn blood in the water. Time to EAT

You‚Äôre bad at this. 

This entire sub is up 100% in GME. Have you been on a ventilator the past two months??
Will it ever?
Aside from DFV, what are some quality recommendations for youtube dd subs?
Instead of selling, you could just rotate into lower risk stocks that won't do as bad in a crash (try to focus on sectors like necessary consumer spending with companies like Walmart, Target or healthcare stocks).
"OIL TO THE FUCKING MOON" = higher oil prices = higher clean energy indices.

You are an idiot.
800 @.91   10x$2C 4/16
Personally I think Oil could be one of the best performing sectors in 2021, beating even tech. Tech will likely enter a bear market after seeing such rapid growth in 2020. Clean energy will not be a good performer either simply because of the massive run up in 2020. Oil on the other hand is going to be a real growth from purely fundamentals. First, oil sector is not over valued, it is either fair value or under valued. Second, with COVID being vaccinated, demand for fossil fuels will soar as people return to normal daily activities (driving to work, going on vacation, shopping, going out on the weekend). Remember, most clean energy is focused on the electric power gen sector, not transportation. The current amount of EVs currently on the road is tiny in comparison to traditional fossil fuel powered cars. Also, as you said, the stimulus will allow people to travel especially during the summer months.

Extremely bullish on oil stocks.
yeah cure my portfolio from losses

Are you sure that you must have earned income? I'm actually pretty curious about this because I couldn't find anything on the IRS site about the details other than the cap limits. 

I was under the impression that spouses without a job can contribute to a ROTH and certain funds like alimony would count - well - because I have friends in that situation. I would have expected day trading gains which are taxable to count. I saw that it was possible to even treat non-tuition stipend payments for contributions.
Thank you. Someone said it.
Nah man. Who buys stocks large in part?  Not retail buyers, but companies via buy backs.  You think an inflated dollar in the hands of joe shmo American is going to stocks?  No way.  Why are things getting more expensive when technology is decreasing the cost to produce?

I've invested slowly over the last few months into Apple (thinking long term investments) but I want to try and ride whatever train is going up right now. I have 1200 in GME due to the rise today, but I wasn't sure if it' was going to go up tomorrow or BB. I'm not a trader by any means, just lurking and trying to learn.

üòÇüòÇ I sold a few of these myself. Don't have the balls you do with that many contracts though
This is a simplified version because I don't know enough to give you anything more lol. There are other factors that influence the price of an option and are referred to as "the greeks" because they're named after letters from the greek alphabet. You'll see people mention delta, theta, IV (implied volatility) and others. All those play into the cost of an option. 

As the stock price gets closer and closer to hitting strike prices you'll see the price of that option go up because it's more likely to expire ITM (in the money). 

I forgot to clarify that in my example you'd be selling the options before the expiry date. You're profiting off the option premium and not the stocks themselves. Most people, to my knowledge, do this because not many people have the capital to exercise their calls. 

Let's say I bought one Tesla call with a strike price of $800 and the stock is now $1000. If I want to exercise the option I'd need $80,000 (800*100) in order to do so. I don't have 80K laying around so I'd sell before and collect the premiums from the options. If I did have 80K around and I exercised I would then immediately flip those 100 shares for $200 profit each for a total of $20,000. My profit would look like $100,000 - ($80,000 + cost of buying call) = profit.

‚Äúa thing that arouses activity or energy in someone or something; a spur or incentive.‚Äù
Example:
"if the tax were abolished, it would act as a stimulus to exports"
More money => more spending => more jobs 

Also minimum wage and average wages are so low everywhere they‚Äôve increased the minimum wage (to substantially lower than where it was in the 90‚Äôs with inflation) it has only shown an increase in jobs in recent years

I am openly criticizing a pumper for the good of the sub.  There are a LOT of bagholders crying today because they're deep in the red with this stock based on the pump they read here.  Many more got in based on the overnight "get in at open - it's hititng a record" when, in fact, it nose-dived again.  
People deserve warnings that this stock is bad and this fraud is just pumping.

You obviously don‚Äôt know what the hell you‚Äôre talking about. Businesses all of a sudden can‚Äôt afford handle doubling their employees wages lol doesn‚Äôt mean they just can turn on a switch and poof everyone gets 15 an hour.

What actually happens is lots of those jobs have already been destroyed from Covid and arnt coming back so businesses will just raise the wages of their current staffing but not hire more people thus in the end - costs stay the same, but fewer people are in the workforce.
Better start considering whether you prefer smooth or chunky PB.

Also, regarding ZOM, I didn't call a price. I simply said I did not like the company and gave the reasons why. You can say that's wrong, if you want, but it is what it is.

Ima just keep holding and selling calls OTM calls.  I'm gonna prolly start buying up some BB tommorrow.  I agree with WSB on this one that its undervalued and alot of potential.  Prolly like a couple grand tommorrow and if it pulls back, buy more.  

I still like Ford for now, but it might trade flat for the next few days so ima sell calls and use the premium to buy BB.  If I can get BB under 10 ill buy leaps otherwise just shares and see what happens.

No, you‚Äôll take GME stock to defend GME stock

now back to finding ways to raise my testosterone
Got Feb calls. Just waiting till earnings and hoping for earnings run up to start next week
Did he mention weed? Weeds gapping up definitely mentioned it very nice sleepy joe now pass that stimmy.
Owning a share means you own a piece of the company that was sold by the founders of the company at some point to raise capital.

In a lot of ways it's similar to owning gold/cash since it only has value since people say it has value.  The difference being that the 'value' changes over time for different reasons.  They're just another thibg people trade that has value.
Lol I‚Äôm glad I held apha weeklies
ICLN startles easily, *u have to be very calm*
I got 3 kids where do I wagered them at?
Well I'm still holding (from $32). From what I've been reading everywhere, the squeeze hasn't even started, and the stock is up 6% after hours now. So yes, it will üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ. My person exit point is $499.99
GME
as if companies aren't already doing as much as possible to reach automation get a clue

Your first problem was ever buying T...
I‚Äôve been waiting for you PLTR üòâ
Three days of preparation for this speech. What a nothingburger. Lol
So as a noob that's just beginning to understand calls and puts. If on that day say, the stock hits $20. The what do you do? Say it hits 20 on the 18, what's the move then? I'm trying to understand where the money comes from. If I understand, you would exercise that option and then technically speaking you owe the amount of $ the stocks are worth right? Do you then sell right away? Sorry if it's a confusing question
LMFAO this dude sold at fucking 20, the day before the massive run-up.

> In a regulatory filing, GameStop disclosed that its director James Wolf sold 810K shares of common stock on January 12th in a total transaction size of $17.19M

Literally everything besides GME and MVIS in my portfolio was red today and I still made 1.60% lol I love it
PUMP THOSE SHARES GME GANG! NO SELLING!
Is the speech over?
Retards!!!!

Its a $1,000 stock. They are signing contracts left and right. 36 countries. What is getting published? NOTHING!!!! Why banks downgrading it??? Why retards????? Citi clown Tyler Radke mops the floor at Citi Group, "downgraded" from $9 to $15. MM buying big time.
TYME has a new drug called "SM-88". It's in Phase 2 of 3. They're doing a presentation at ASCO gastrointestinal cancers symposium on January 17th.

Down .04% is literally the dumbest definition of tanking I‚Äôve ever heard. Congrats on that
ah, muchas gracias
I think most of the time it's employers who determine wages not the employee. Most people making minimum wage are stuck making it, they didn't decide to just be economically fucked over their whole lives. When Walmart and Amazon are forced to pay decent wages then our taxes can stop paying for all the welfare those employees need to survive since they are being held below the poverty line.

How do we feel about RMO calls?
I was considering buying the twitter dip, but given the recent leaks I guess it's all downward from here. I hope $SNAP bounces back, as I do have quite a bit of shares of that stock.

That's all I ask for.
You're not just giving up some money, you're giving up a lot. They buy the property, do pretty minor cosmetic work, and then flip it. If they were giving you a good offer they wouldn't make any profit.

If legit want to exercise the call then yes.  If you dont have the funds then it will expire and you get the difference. Whats your strike price?
Yes get this shit stock PLTR over $28. I want the dumbass to exercise the calls so I can get rid of this crap.
You mean , when is it going to hit $50 tomorrow? Prob before lunch!
Biden said ‚ÄúWe will finance the stimulus through AFRM for 0% interest‚Äù
PLTR $26.65. Fuck you bears!

When exactly do you purchase?
Guys don‚Äôt fall for the trap, PLTR will be red by 1100
Ive been in this stock for 2 months and I only have 4 hairs left on my head like Homer Simpson

Spend a lot of money. More stimulus. Tax the rich. Re-invest in a new American Revolution with clean energy and innovation.

More taxes but also clean energy. I think it just cancels each other out. Sideways for next few months
It was a speech about how he‚Äôll talk about everything at another time
Yes. It left the stimmy pretty much up to our imagination
Excuse me, where‚Äôs the lobby?
Yeah no worries there‚Äôs some good posts that explain that a bit better. I got in a $20 but now have some money to DCA up
This $2 trillion stimmy package is just a start, like an appetizer. The real thing will come in the spring and be much bigger.
He calls for more stimulus money, more unemployment, more manufacturing.  Brief mention of clean energy.
Are MSFT fuk?
Thanks for that $SENS heads up! Hopefully it holds until market open!
one dem in senate is all it takes. The WV dem is basically a republican
He‚Äôs more entertaining than any politician, I think that‚Äôs a known fact whether you agree with him or not

Might be too early to say definitively, but Biden‚Äôs stimulus speech seemed like a nothing burger. 

RIP OTM 1/15 options.
You obviously don‚Äôt understand how solar works. There are two types of inverters for a solar array:

1) Micro-Inverters. Enphase. They put an inverter on EACH panel. The DC current output of each panel is inverted to AC individually.

2) Central Inverters: SolarEdge, SMA, soon to be Tesla. The DC output from the ENTIRE array goes to a single CENTRAL inverter and is inverted to AC. These commonly include POWER OPTIMIZERS on each panel but this is different from a micro inverter.

Tesla is coming out with their own CENTRAL INVERTER. Nowhere do they say micro-inverter. Central inverters have specific kW sizes and Tesla will be coming out with a sub 3 and sub 7 kW micro-inverter. Look it up dude.

Whoaaaaa interesting comment
You don't think they'll be driven even harder by having to pay their minimum wage employees more? Get a clue
Lol. I‚Äôm kidding about the paper trading. But I did post some of my positions just now in another comment. Mostly boring covered calls and csp on half meme and half boomer stocks
you forgot to mention the most important piece

"Ryan Cohen replacing Kamala Harris as VP"

Man I feel like shit today which is a shame since I have such good gains
I'm not sure if Woodforest is near you but you might check with them. I think they still use chex, but I know they've done accounts for people on chex that might bank denied.
Yeah I've shares and couple calls expiring July
Nice to watch a politician speak that has a hopeful message.
Boooo
My only holdings right now are BB and Apple, but I am very worried cuz right know Apple is performing like a typical boomer stock. I am very bullish and expect historic earnings, but I am not sure if the market will move much. Why are you so confident that Apple could reach 150 by Feb 19?
My leaps are hungry
They‚Äôre already >$42.
Biden? More like BiDump

Please do my calls would appreciate it üôè
yugely
Hopefully, this is just the iBeginning
not touching this POS again. No.
Because of this I‚Äôm hanging on to my pltr calls.
PLTR, BB, GME. Quit worrying bro
This is also about crushing Melvin Capital, seeing them driven before you, and hearing the lamentation of their wives' boyfriends' sidechicks.
Better than the OG

Lol. Thank you, brother! I did hit higher highs today. I rolled most to next weeks 55C at cost. I took a couple grand off the table (to buy Luigi‚Äôs Mansion and a Switch), but I am all in pretty much. I think this short squeeze is just getting started and margin calls will be happening a lot tomorrow and early next week. Price target is $80+. Good luck out there, brother!
You‚Äôd have to buy the 100 shares the option represents to exercise it, most people don‚Äôt have the capital to do that
Let me tell you a couple of three things first half of sopranos s6 is a complete waste ...Melvin bank never had the makings of a varsity athlete .

Because GME stole the spotlight.
Honestly unless you‚Äôre at a point where you‚Äôre trying to retire or need supplemental income because you‚Äôre traveling don‚Äôt invest too heavily in dividend stocks. I‚Äôve bought and sold Bitcoin too but I won‚Äôt buy more unless it hits 18K again. I‚Äôm fine with the gains I prefer investing in the market where I can actually do DD on a company or industry lol. If you‚Äôre young and trying to grow your portfolio with lower risk I‚Äôd recommend ETFs. They remove the risk of a particular stock going down due to issues within the specific company, instead you‚Äôre exposed to several companies within that sector so unless that entire industry fails you‚Äôre okay. I‚Äôm shooting for higher growth so willing to accept some risk. I‚Äôm in a lot of ARK ETFs. If you want dividends stay away from stocks that do not have a good 5 year growth rate of beating the market. Some companies with great dividend yields just do not have much potential for growth. Shoot for a .04-.05% yield in blue chips like Home Depot, & AT&T. Big companies whose value is known and isn‚Äôt as reactive to news. If you need additional income you can sell far OTM covered calls as well.
ICLN always green AH then dump -3% after open
Once news gets out everyone is gonna but pltr üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Bro this is such a clear diversion away from GME, ah shit
That‚Äôs good timing and you‚Äôve done well there. 3xStocks I only hold for 1 week max as they always want to return to a base level. Still they can be hugely powerful so well done. My best was on before NYE and I made 50% on a day trade. Thank you 3x leverage. 

The risk was incredibly low, the probability of opportunity to do the trade was extremely low!

Don't worry, they'll get shook out after the next big dip. They come and go with the market, once they lose big, only the diamond hands will remain. They'll definitely lose big, because they don't know what they're doing and listen to us retards.

Dude would pump the market with vague positivity the call the top once a month and fuck everyones calls. Welcome to stability bitches
whew sold my 30c and half my 40c for gme and bought 2 55c for fun let's see how this rides tomorrow
Why tf is GME popping so much though
ok legit, stick with GME or go BB? Some people are saying go BB and I have no idea what to jump to.
which ones? snp hasnt dropped all that much?
About time cathie got on board. There better not be any more plant ear deniers left in here.

sell the news
Yea guys pack it up, people in the Reddit comments say it‚Äôs bad so it‚Äôs over.

Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know what the hell you‚Äôre talking about. You know what‚Äôs worse than inflation? A depression. And that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre heading without the constant supply of stimulus through this incredibly tough economic time.

I picked the wrong week to sell CC on APHA ü§®
Thank you for your answer, it helps a lot! So just a clarification question, when you say not to exercise, do you mean to sell back that contract for a higher premium? And if so, would that potentially put you the red as it puts the sellers obligation on you and whoever buys may choose to exercise?
I'm balls deep in PLTR and this just got my dick hard. I ain't gay

A truly shameful display, really. I feel incredible sadness for you and your family, which must be grieving for your soul, even though you are still walking the mortal plane of existence.
For sure. He answered every question. Even if he had no clue.

I liked the he just said whatever his dumb brain was thinking
Yeah I thought Biden had a very positive future outlook and plan while also acknowledging the bad times right now. maybe ppl just expected the positivity minus the realism but that's something only trump would do
He took the cash and bought $35 calls.....
seriously everyone else just get off their bullshit stock and ride the GME train for the next month. you retards are trying to get everyone that made tons of money to yolo into something else when the squeeze hasn‚Äôt even started?!
i fucking hope so. can‚Äôt believe i diamond handed them this long only for it to moon on the fucking expiration date hahaha
Gme will never see $30 again
*Hello, and welcome to GameStop.*

That‚Äôs all you need.
I agree with your take on the spending bill which was a load of hot garbage. But, even if people do spend it on (unnecessary) goods, that still technically stimulates the economy and will keep the people who sell such goods in business.
Im 99.9% they keep this man in some kind of freezer all day. Dude was pale as fuck and walked off the stage like Robocop
That‚Äôs true but there could be a large sell off at open similar to what happened today
What channel? I missed it lul

I don't like change! the new uppy and downy arrows are annoying
Depends on the company. But I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been a short ratio like gme before. Definitely not one with that and WSB.
This is close to me... 180k debt. 470k house but had 90k for down-payment.

I‚Äôm an extremely risk averse but this is what I‚Äôve learned:

- Since 95% of my investments are in indexes the only way I lose all my money is if literally all the companies go bankrupt - at which point we‚Äôd probably be in an apocalypse and I plan on leaving with the first wave.

- I have enough ‚Äúcash‚Äù on hand to maintain me for the next 6 months (long enough to pivot to a new career If need be) so I don‚Äôt need to tap into existing investments so I can focus on long term.

- since I‚Äôm not planning on retiring for another 15-20 years, I‚Äôm fairly confident that stocks will be worth a lot more at that point. Sure they‚Äôll go down but they always go up.

- I resisted the urge to sell during this last recession when I lost 20% of my NW in order to become more resilient and it helped. Now I don‚Äôt care if my NW goes down 5-10k that week as it‚Äôll likely go up within a year.

Tl;dr I‚Äôve put enough barriers in place to protect me immediately in case anything ‚Äúwithin reason‚Äù happens making it easier to focus 15-20 years on the future.

I should also add being employed helps a lot too with not being pessimistic.
Hell to the yes. Exercise if you can so the shorts can't buy your shares back!

You want to invest in companies with less cash flow? Whatever floats your boat.
It's easy when you have cash to buy the dip. Definitely way tougher if you're fully invested

real talk boys, im 95%/5% in GME/MT portfolio started the year 2021 at 30k now at 75k

I know GME is memeing right now but i need to diversify. thinking of doing 70%/20%/10% GME/PLTR/MT respectively

Sound like decent diversification?
Yeah I saw this, made me think of this post.  I'm not happy about it but I'm still trying to determine who's the bigger scam artists: EOSE or Iceberg.  I've sent my info to Block & Leviton LLP and emailed EOSE as well for some answers.

Well I don't know what the article says because I can't fucking read. What I do know is that it's all a bunch of baloney, written by a üåàüêª praying on our downfall.

Cinemas were always packed out any time I went. Get 50 quid out of every 2 people for food and tickets. If I want to watch a movie at home I will. If I want to go out I will. It‚Äôs not about the movie itself, I‚Äôd wait until it‚Äôs available if I don‚Äôt feel like going. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd pay to watch it at home if there is hundreds on Netflix, Disney and Prime I haven‚Äôt seen.
So is the GME situation just a technical squeeze, or is it also based on the company  reinventing themselves and being worth the new price?

Like, is it going to drop like a rock after the squeeze or will it still settle at a higher valuation post-squeeze?
Is it still time to buy when the market opens ? Or it would be a fomo to buy now

I personally think that there's one more very important point to it.

Lots of people do what you describe with other aims, but I think that the most common denominator in this community is that the end goal is to buy time/freedom in some form or another, with early retirement being the most common but not the only way to leverage your savings to escape the rat race.
u/savevideo
> I was under the impression that the seller will not be assigned until the breakeven price is hit.

False. Nobody cares about the seller's breakeven, including the seller.

> Is the strike price the only thing worth considering? What happens if for example I'm selling a put at strike $18 with b/e $20 due to $2.00 premium and the stock is at $19 at expiry?

The only things that matter for gain/loss calculation is how much credit you received at open and how much you paid to close it. That's it.

As the seller, you have zero control over assignment. It could happen at any time. Usually, it only happens very near expiration, because exercising costs the buyer his extrinsic value and people don't like throwing money away.

There is absolutely nothing inevitable about it. Apart from the Wheel strategy, none of my short puts have ever been assigned, by intention. The simplest way to avoid assignment is *don't hold positions to expiration*.
Cathie probably doesn‚Äôt even give a shit about PLTR, she did it for us, for the WSB bagholders. She a real one!
Yeah that‚Äôs when the big infrastructure packages will come in

You're right.. We should just keep it at 8.00 and hr because there's no point in raising wages while everything else gets more expensive anyway.. gtfo of here with that logic. And there are absolutely people who perform service jobs so you can sit around and bitch on the internet about low income workers from an INVESTING sub reddit. If anything.. trickle up economics will make businesses fly over the next couple years. Dow broke 30 when he came online and the pandemic fail has cost alot of those low wage earners a lot of income. I am certain they are excited to begin recuperating it in years to come

Probably not but don‚Äôt be surprised if it dips for whatever reason. Weed stock in general is only going to go up until legalization/decriminalization.

Higher minimum wage is more purchasing power to people who actually get the boost in minimum wage but remain hired. Supply and demand of labor is a function, with each $ increase in minimum wage resulting to an increase in involuntary unemployment. In all likelihood unemployment will increase but people remained hired earning  minimum wage will get an increase in purchasing power

Use this one. [https://www.calculator.net/interest-calculator.html](https://www.calculator.net/interest-calculator.html)

Yes there are lot of compound interest cal, but most of them do not have feature this one does which is to add your contribution in the beginning of the year, or the end of the year. Not only that, but this has monthly and annually contribution option. Some calculator only have either one, not both. This also have inflation % and tax % included.   


This one also have graph and pie chart. It's very clean, and not messy as the other one i seen.

S&P Global Ratings is an American credit rating agency and a division of S&P Global that publishes financial research and analysis on stocks, bonds, and commodities. S&P is considered the largest of the Big Three credit-rating agencies, which also include Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.  

Are you trying to tell people that a credit rating agency, a business, is not trying to make money? Or are you being a pedant, indicating that making money isn't a commonly used phrase for earning money?

Well, imagine thinking this stock is worth 10$ (lots of people still don't believe in the turnaround story). It's now at 40$ and you think it will go back down - doesn't it make sense to short it ? I mean, if you think this is the squeeze and it is as high as it'll get.
Congrats!
Good for PLTR, its fans are loyal so they should be rewarded with it reaching 30 by eod tomorrow.
  A possible acceleration in long term white collar labor cost reduction may happen or be happening because of what employers learned by having so many white collars jobs successfully performed remotely due to COVID-19. In the short term this is a big win for the remote worker.

Thesis:

When employers recognize that many of their jobs can be done and done well remotely, they will have the data to move them overseas to lower labor costs. A win win for companies, for remote workers, not so much.

Tell me this ain't so!
Same. Doing my part
NEVER bet against the meme stock
MMs waiting for all the 380-400c's to expire worthless at opex. Look at the OI on all the spx and spy options. People have been buying them up since last year and MMs are going to expire them worthless.
Im confident that jan 2022/23 calls on XOM or BP will still be 5-10 bagger. I loaded up on XOM leaps back in december and currently up 120%. BP leaps from the same time are currently up 80%.

BUY PLTR ASAP OF U CAN
There is like no volume for calls on this.
This was a test to see how market will perform by March 19. Looks like 17% up for now.
if the stock reaches $34 tomorrow you will definitely make a profit. you don‚Äôt need to exercise the option if you don‚Äôt want to buy the 100 shares. just sell the option and take your profits

Exactly. Biden actually will do infrastructure week.... although Trump's constant pushing back of it definitely caused a lot of little opportunities to make a buck on the fake hype. I'll kinda miss that, but yeah, look for the tickers that have been around at least as long as Biden has. That's who is gonna benefit from a return to "normal".
> Are you sure that you must have earned income? I'm actually pretty curious about this because I couldn't find anything on the IRS site about the details other than the cap limits.

See [Pub 590](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a) for  definitions of "compensation" for IRA contributions

> I was under the impression that spouses without a job can contribute to a ROTH and certain funds like alimony would count

Yes, spouses not working but that make enough and are MFJ can contribute, also known as the "spousal" IRA (though not really an account called a spousal IRA) - and in Pub 509 it notes that alimony counts as compensation, but that dividend and interest income do not

>  I saw that it was possible to even treat non-tuition stipend payments for contributions.

This is a recent change, also noted in Pub 509:

"Certain taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipends. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2019, certain taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments are treated as compensation for the purpose of IRA contributions. Compensation will include any amount included in your gross income and paid to aid in your pursuit of graduate or postdoctoral study."
Ah ok, no worries.
This is not the way.

That sounds right to me. Trailing stop losses can also be used to help reduce large unexpected swings. I will usually sit on my cash long term investment, but I always set trailing stops for margin just in case. I usually set mine at 10%, but many people will use 12% or 15%

I let Blackberry go by at $5 when I was looking for an out of favor leading tech company with a valuable brand and dedicated customers who love the product. I bought at over $9 because watching value double without me is my custom, every freaking time. Today it was all over wsb as it went up 20%. It shall be a meme stock now. Wonderful.

I didn't do much analysis at all, and never do math beyond a 5th grade level. I decided it was undervalued after looking at it's narrative potential. The chart does the job of a salesman. It peaked years ago above $130. It has looked cheap since then. They had an announcement about an agreement with Amazon a year ago that didn't get traction until recently. They are putting out a new phone. They are a security company now. They have a lot of tech in lots of places, one of which is every EV that isn't Tesla. Whatever, I know they have a powerful brand and I want my money back for the Classic that served me well for four years. They have great leadership. I'm Canadian. They're Canadian. We're Canadian. And that's why I bought Bombardier.

Cathie bought $13 million PLTR on the dip meanwhile wsb paper hands were selling
I‚Äôll be the fist one to admit I shorted GME yesterday when it was up 70%.   So far have lost half (good thing I only placed one put). 

As per your question the answer is; as long as all of you guys keep your calls and more importantly your shares the rally & squeeze will continue. However if people start to sell and it snowballs it will drop hard.  

I still think GME is a busted business but will also admit I was totally wrong and if there was a good way to lose money this would be it.  Love how everyone here fucked the big boys
That's cute. What's next? you gonna say the stonk market isn't a casino? lol gtfo

All these beautiful gains feel like nothing after Deepfuckingvalue posts
Young Sheldon
It‚Äôs a mix of both. The fundamentals have changed because of the new board members, that likely triggered what‚Äôs happening now but what‚Äôs going on now is technical. It will drop and settle at a higher base than before imo (maybe around $30ish?)
Exactly. I‚Äôm unlearning. Sold 3500 at 25, (cost 17) because it jumped and I was on the road and was like it can‚Äôt go that high. 

Fucking wrong. I did that and I closed out my 100 x 1/15 30C for 7 cents...why? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but goddamn if it isn‚Äôt beautiful what‚Äôs going on here.

Does cathie wood have an onlyfans?
It's called politics.
She was too busy buying your 25c for pennies
There was plenty of insider selling.
Why did that SENS post get flagged as suspicious
Both. 

Lots of rumors were out that they were near bankruptcy, which drove all the shorting. Performance after the change in leadership made it clear that they're headed in the right direction and bankruptcy is off the table. Now shorters are shitting themselves.
I‚Äôm just worried there are American companies ready to take their market share.  Once it‚Äôs legal of course.
what the fuck why did we close with 100k shares of GME available at a smaller percentage fee?
That feeling when your OTM calls turn into ITM calls 6 months before expiry (Thanks APHA)
GME can definitely reach $60 within the next 5 months...
Um why is citi getting such a nice reward, could I be citi
Yeah, I agree with everything you said.  I never said they'll overtake Nvidia's market share anytime soon.  I'm just saying that if CNDA's improvement leaps continue at this pace they'll be able to compete in the same way that Epyc is competing with Xeon.  Although, you're right we have to wait and see.

This is why their stock price is low, and I'm covering this in my DD video on Sunday. It's a gamble like any other penny stock, but I believe the positives outweigh the negatives on this one.

They had to completely shutter their operations and new patient intake during COVID, and they had to cut half their staff because their funding got pulled.

They only restarted in October.
Nice well when all the option vig is gone roll next week's into shares, unless you sell early... but don't sell early lol
There is potential that they are worth more than the lows that they were at but the prices rn are defiantly way more then that and even those prices would be speculative. Just like ever other company lol.

I'm pretty sure that's the closing time, not the opening time. The "0 DTE" includes options that were opened on expiration day, or the day before, and even 2 days before, IIRC.
Last few days - Correction resulting from company reinventing themselves and new management with RC and chewie gang. Still undervalued. Has okay fundamentals with good sales recently and next earning reports should be good. Add growing interest in the short squeeze through major outlets and the gap ups are even higher. Soon the squeeze will happen and we‚Äôll see ungodly amount of returns. They‚Äôre going to have to invent a new shade of green to reflect our profits
yield curve rising and M2 going down.  On top of that tomorrow is monthly opex.  Excited to see what next week is going to look like

But whoops
7% is the market average, that shouldn‚Äôt be what one strives for. Cause then why the hell arnt they just investing in VTI?

The real aim for investors is between 10-15% per year for over 10 years. If you can do that, you‚Äôll be rich. But few can because it‚Äôs incredibly difficult.
Futures wouldve exploded if mango presented this same stimulus
PLTR is pumping after hours, bought 200 more today to bring me to a measly 600 shares but I am excited for market open. I really need AMD to pull through the next 2 weeks as I have 75 spreads open at $91/90 currently that I have been slowly buying/selling as price jumps.
Chickened out. Glad I did. It was up 22% at open, dropped to 6.5% (where I would have paper handed the shit out of that) before it went back up.
When you buy an options call and then sell to close that position say at a profit instead of exorcizing the right to buy the shares, who buys that?  I sell it but who buys it, someone else buys the remainder of that contract?

You are stupid, but probably more confused than stupid.

LEAPs work just like any other option, they're just a year+ out.

The nice thing about them is they derive a large part of their value from time, so they stay worth a lot of money even if price goes against you.

they have a strike price just like any other option and if the strike price is below current price, you are ITM on a call and OTM on a put. Just like any other option.

Previous one gave away billions (or tax breaks) to corporations.  How much is it this time?
To be fair, them buying it no matter how large the position will create a positive sentiment
really need spy to have a +1% day tomorrow... :(
Not since the Crips and Bloods marched peacefully together in the first gang truce for 27 years have two gangs been so beautifully united as GME & PLTR
Only if you invest enough than she emails you a link

Can you imagine being in WSB are not being part of GME gang? I can‚Äôt.. I feel stupid for only having 300 shares
Yeah, this probably belongs in r/tax.

Opening an IRA has no tax consequence. The tax stuff comes into play when you make contributions or withdrawals.
Made more in GME this week than 3 months salary I fucking love this place
I got both today, moon mission confirmed for both

Yes for sure, imma see if it dips below 40 in the am, then if not I'll buy before it hits 44/45. That's the plan anyways

Cathie bought a fuckton of PLTR today
Not going to be flat.  It will head up.  Stimmy, rejoining the world economy, and clean energy will lift the markets.  Corps don't care about slightly higher taxes if they are selling twice as much product.  Team Trickle Up inbound!

Yep. And the movie ends with him making a shit ton of money. But a lot of those guys you see, all the banks and the assholes, a lot of them made money in the end too. Sure a lot of them fucked up and lost everything but most of it was thrust onto the middle and lower class.

GME is definitely a spirit bomb kind of story. WSB sending Cohen our power!
Those are my rocks. Selling way otm calls on them. Don‚Äôt be greedy collecting premiums. These things can fly and bite you in the ass. However with tsla being speculated to correct it‚Äôs a nice little hedge.
What, do you hate money?
You can‚Äôt compare GameStop with PLTR. Completely different businesses in different life cycles of a company. The only similarity they have is they‚Äôre meme stonks.

PLTR literally cannot shit the bed. There‚Äôs not much action because of üåàüêª

There has been an insane amount of bullish news for oil lately the market has barely even begun to price in. Like enough to start another oil supercycle. XOM/BP are still trading at half of what they will probably will be in a year. Leaps on them is going to net insane returns, especially if oil experiences a demand squeeze from production cutbacks and post-covid euphoric demand.

Intel can‚Äôt get past 12nm reliably with their fabs, TSMC are stepping up tooling up for 5mn. The only way forward for Intel is to outsource to TSMC or Samsung - But are fabs stretches to capacity even going to want a short term customer over loyal ones? There‚Äôs some new rumours that TSMC will create i3‚Äôs for intel, however I find that hard to believe. Intel need to do something, but they won‚Äôt catch up for at least a few years. AMD is set until 2024.

If your stocks drop 10%, your portfolio drops 20% and high yield stocks tend to drop a lot when there is volatility in the market. Also QYLD is one of the worst stocks you could own on margin.

I am a bit worried about my shares and 135 Feb 17 calls, because it seems that Apple is performing like a typical boomer stock. All the reports point to historic earnings, but the stock is barely holding ground. I am a bit worried that it will fall more pre earnings, cuz all the boomer analysts are saying that new stimulus will make investors switch from tech to industrials, which does not make any sense actually. People will buy f.king Iphones with their checks, not plane tickets.
Where is Catherine pltr share news, I cannot find anything.
I have PLTR 30 and SpCe 30 calls expiring tomorrow. Never thought this would happen.

This is SO crazy as I have been tracking all of ARK buys and sells for the last 2 months, and whatever they buy, the security goes up within the next day. 

I have seen this with so many, to name a few are TDOC, EDIT, CRISPR, ZM, and now PLTR today, Cahtie Woods is a freakin' wizard!

Good question, I have been a Buffett fan for decades. I live in Nebraska and go to the shareholders meeting every year. I still believe that there is plenty of growth there. Every time one of my stocks have a big win and I sell them I either buy brk or an index fund with the proceeds. It‚Äôs about 50/50 for me. So I certainly do buy index funds and I would say your logic is solid.

Cathie Wood / ARKW just bought 497,100 shares today.
> Is the profit on each of the 4 purchases tracked with that individual purchase or would I have to wait to take any profits until August 1?

It's tracked with the set of shares you bought on each date, so at this moment you could sell the set of shares you bought on Jan 1 and only pay LTCG on the earnings - you'd have to wait until it's been at least one year from the other sell dates to sell those sets of shares pay LTCG rather than STCG

If this is a homework question, then it should be easy for me to find information about this topic in a textbook or other course material. Could you point me to that material please? I'm happy do figure this out myself, but I already tried googling it and I can't find any examples of compound interest where there is a fee attached or where the compounding doesn't happen automatically. Thanks!
Yeah I'm not overweight so that's not it. But predisposition makes sense. Much of my family have intestinal problems.

[Following up on my job hunting from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kwdh85/daily_fi_discussion_thread_wednesday_january_13/gj6ic4g/?context=3):   

Today's update was basically nothing new. New ETA for the manager role is next week. There is a high level technical role, equivalent to director, that I'm also being considered for. The VP wants "to bring me back" so he's figurig out how best to do so. Supposedly. I'm not holding my breath and I'm still looking. I'll take a look at the specific technical title they are think and see if I can apply to something similar elsewhere as well.

The good news is there's another opening that I may be able to get a friend to fill who is perfect for the job and desperate for a job. He needs to get the 2 years work experience and it largely doesn't matter where.

DD is impossible when a totalitarian state permits cooking the books and manipulates their currency for national pride. You have absolutely no way of knowing if any of the numbers for any Chinese firm are real so it's blind gambling. NIO and BABA are the next Luck*n.
This is what MartyMoho could have been.
Where did you see this?
its called pumping.
You took profits, and you missed a lot of gain that‚Äôs true. You paper handed but it was a safe bet. But it‚Äôs not to late to use those gains to buy more shares, it‚Äôll only go up. Literally can‚Äôt go tits up.
Agreed. Should have just focused on clean energy and checks.
CHWY, NET, ROBO, GEVO
How new are
550k added to ARK
Another thing to keep in mind is the merger with Tilray. Your shares will be converted to Tilray shares, you will get 0.83 shares of Tilray for each APHA share you own. Tilray is currently way up also, trading at around $20. APHA is hovering around 12.50-13. I am not a mathematician but it looks to me like APHA is still a bargain, considering 20 x 0.83 = 16.60

I have 300 shares of APHA and I am definitely NOT selling. Good luck with whatever you choose to do!
Cathie bought more TDOC too, she‚Äôs obsessed with that stock
I‚Äôve been waiting for this day. We had the pop on the Amazon news and then a lull. Hopefully money starts flowing into now. I actually like the company too!
Anybody that shorts anything should be prepared to take a bath.
Why? You can get in on skynet before it vaporizes us
pltr on a mission after hours
Fuck you
Checking futures after reading this sub reminds me of my friends bitching about their nfl team losing then I check the score and they‚Äôre down 10-7 in the third quarter.
Calls
It‚Äôs mind boggling but I realized that the market goes up when ppl are doubtful bc puts are converted into more upward momentum when they expire worthless as market is flat or creeps up. 

Same goes for when the market is max bullish, and volatility is forcefully pushed down. But, when the market can‚Äôt suppress volatility and stocks are losing liquidity to bonds, then a forceful reversal may happen on equities if people are hedging, taking profits, and moving to safe havens
I sold 1/15 147 Arkk. Am i fucked ? ü•∫
ü§£
If it hits 50 I sell, that‚Äôs more than double profit and im not waiting for the pump to die down
I sold my 1/15 20 calls for a loss last week. I feel stupid.
Imagine buying an ETF and expecting meme price action

Uhh PLTR 30 won't print
GME and PLTR, the pillars of WSB
Probably a couple hundred and because I thought it would take a dip at close but nope
You get that and I‚Äôll get a sticker for my laptop
You had all of the past year to get on that train.
Came here to say basically this.   Cramer is gonna make BBBY into GME part 2.   Also gonna flip some tricks with brokerage staff to beg to get in on coinbase IPO
We are pumping Green, Black and Brown Economy.  Would have liked more discussion about concrete and steel...
This mans a fucking time traveler and no one can convince me otherwise
I think the catalyst for that was the post itself. Within the first hour after that Reddit post the stock rose over 25%, without any other reason. It's probably gonna dump hard.
Mostly even across all of these:

MTDR, CCL, LADR, GEVO, FuelCell En, POWW, WOOF

Wondering where I should go for best growth
He was good at pumping
Remember when Dems were screeching for 4 years about rigged elections after shitting on the sidewalk outside the nyse
Though you may think it‚Äôs not much in dollars, 30% in 2 months is pretty impressive. Keep up the good work
JPM?
I've only got $20 worth that I didn't buy till today. Just got back from a "no screen" week. üò≠
I wish I yolo'd my 10K with him. I'd be sitting with a cool 1M in the portfolio....
Except GME, 6% already whats good
This comment gave me some actual hope. Real, actual hope. Thank you.
Bought a LEAP just today
Jim Cramer quickly becoming my favorite tv personality. Watch your back guy fieri
My God..... Imagine a short squeeze on AMC.....
Just saw this too, pretty cool.

What's a good play on this? 

SPY Call at the Open?

Just remember the short term tax rate vs long term. My advice stay in the market until you die.

Man I feel like ass. I literally sat in my house all day and smoked weed and looked at my phone screen most the time. Jerked off and ate food. Literally a shit stain but $6k unrealized gains. Still feel like ass. Maybe might go for a run around the hood like a hipster
Because we said so

Where the tendies OP?
Oh I didn't understand that's what OP was talking about. Thought they were talking about selling through redfin
And a -5% dip tomorrow at close yay
Great song tho
What's in the menu for tomorrow?  I'm thinking GME short margin calls at open.  üçΩ
Cramer said we are incredible to watch!!!!!
6.6bil annual rev 2019. They‚Äôll be positive FCF next ER and moving forward. Without the potential squeeze GME is worth over $100/share. Cohen will take us there, but the MOASS might be our express

What is this PLTR AH action for?
Joe Bearden

Joe Bidump
Exactly, and if businesses have trouble they can always subsidize it. Just like how Tesla is thriving. Policies helping the lower class are very necessary to the health of the economy. You can always offer incentive to big business but if you do it without securing results it doesn't make sense.
nop, pump n dump
Shit. I meant calls for Tuesday. I didn't work today so that threw me off. Plus I've been putting in ot. Last week was like 90 hours
Did you earn the money from an employer/job showing earned income? You could open a Roth IRA with a parent as the person to act and when you get to be of age you take it over
just Cathie
Did she buy today? Where can I find this info?
500k shares bought for ARKW
Aapl, premiums sunk today
hi its me the SEC
Naw house will pass it blindly. They will use nuclear option and pass it in the senate. It goes through. It‚Äôs just been priced in.
It will be 100 eoy chill
Bears forgot about Biden‚Äôs speech now their puts are shakin, better learn some timing
That would've be hysterical hahaha
4/16 19c 4/16 30c and 1/29 50c
Why? Was it dropped in water?
How can I leave what any of this means? Like he "held onto Jan 15 calls right before they expired"

I don't understand any words in that..


Also why did be? Just sheer chance? Did he throw tons of money into it by hope? Not to sound like an actual retard (not in the flattering way) did he likely have inside knowledge?

How can I understand these words more? Googling isn't helping when I don't know what I'm looking for.

So a week or less before he would have been busted, out of nowhere the market shot up on GME? Does u/D do this with multiple stocks and this is the one that just made it and is noteworthy?

Well, at least it isn‚Äôt $600 again, that was fucking ridiculous.
Great call, bought with an average of 0.7014 and its up 1.11 after hours right now

Biden is going to be the death of the market for the next 4 years!
Not our problem
They already sold at around 31, its already been gobbled up. The reason they sold is a firm they work for has a rule about owning too much so he was forced to sell. it wasn't a gamestop problem.
have faith my son üöÄ  üöÄ
At least i still have 3 $26 calls to laugh at my fucking face tomorrow
Cathie buy I buy it‚Äôs that simple

CRAMER FINALLY DID IT!!!!!!! 

 
is this the top?
Never said that's what people should aim for as a goal, but it should definitely be your lowest point early on. As you say, why bother trying if you're not atleast matching the market.
Someone gimme a movie to watch

Can you tell me 3 days before it‚Äôs gonna pump because I‚Äôm not tryna lock up money for 2 years
Yes I understand that but it wastes my time having to check ü¶ç
8.5 here just started trading and about to make my first hundo.
It‚Äôs because the green market is supposed to take off under Biden especially since the market has been heading that way the past 4 years even under an ‚Äúunfriendly‚Äù administration towards green energy. With the market doing its own thing but now being bolstered by a new administration it should have good returns for as long as Democrats keep good on their word.
Look at PLTR after hours
Tesla went up a bit AHüò© please fly tomorrow

It's based on the date you bought the shares, so you'd owe STCG on the earnings of shares you bought within the previous 12 months, and LTCG on the earnings of the rests of the shares

My first experience with Cramer was my economics teacher trying to be cool showing us the vidya of stewart reaming him out

Now I sit around each night, no cable of course, hoping to hear Cramer pumped up the stonks in my portfolio.

IDC what they say I love you Cramer
How big is bidens stimulus package?
I haven‚Äôt actually loled in a awhile, this is actually good. I‚Äôm shocked you composed this thing
Why the fuck is spy dumping... you limp dick pile of shit! He said 1.9 TRILLION!
Why bb ?

He‚Äôs at 15,540
Icln pleas fly
Is that a joke or serious?
Get that naysayer out of here! To the GULAG!
I sold all of my positions today to free up $75k. If that shit even thinks about going down I will be buying every single share I can get my hands on.

Cathie Wood added PLTR to ARKW.

The market is so 50:50 right now.  One has to watch closely and be ready to move.  I'm not worried about inflation though.  The economy is not going to be good enough for a long time to put the inflation pressures into play.

Ahhhh, ark investors news eh?
y‚Äôall too worried about ICLN like bro when was the last time UCLN‚Äôd your room ?
PIPP is now 50% above NAV. Would not recommend buying at these levels. Too many people are FOMOing into SPACs that are 40-60% above NAV with no target in sight.

Instead take a gander as GSAH or DMYI.

If DMYI follows the timeline of DMYT (now RSI) or DMYD (picks and shovels of sports betting), we may potentially see a merger announcement in the next few weeks. The DMY team moves fast.

I bought DMYI warrants today. GNRS warrants are still under $2 as well.
BB projection?
I know, I was just saying I calculate like this with my shares. I just did this two days back
 Taxes are for smooth brains. We just sell IOUs with 0%. And if we can't sell enough, we just buy them ourselves. How does that work? No one fucking knows.

50%+? I think you're missing a zero. It should say 500%+

I hope they do pay off for you - I've got some Feb 30c calls myself, so a pop would do us both good!
I'm in 300 shares at 10.07 and gonna have to buy my calls tomorrow at open.

WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO MY BB
Because Cathie W is a WSBer
Cathie bought more shares?

Cathie bae
Ahh the good ole days. When Antifa was just a bunch of peaceful grungy stoners protesting evil capitalism
I just read your comment history for the past iunno, 14 days or so. You've had 2 other comments about GME. Both were "glad gme idiots got washed out." Etc. We've all doubled our portfolios on shares alone, calls are exponentially higher returns. Gl on your 23% gains yoy Melvin.
simp.
Fuck it I'm in
yes but the question is, does it pop tomorrow or 2 years from now?

are we in 1998 or 2001

What's the problem
Same
+30%
My dude got a Cramer shout out. Excellent
I was working at WalMart when this started. I had a friend who was working part time making 10 an hour who lost is job, and suddenly was making more than me while I was dealing with crazed Karen‚Äôs demanding toilet paper and hand sanitizer. While I and all my older coworkers were being exposed by these people.

&#x200B;

There are people who definitely need it and overall I get why it‚Äôs important. But those situations like I described almost feel insulting
I advocate for another paper trading competition
He told Cathie Wood to buy a half a million shares.
Part of the problem is we don't educate kids about money and basic finance and how to save and grow your money. Everything I know about those things I had to learn myself. All the useless shit they teach kids and don't spend 5 minutes on budgeting and credit, etc etc
I would be so in the fucking money if that happened.  Like lean fucking fire type in the money.
I should bought more when it was at 3$ but I am shell shocked on weed stocks but very happy with it now... just need acb to hit 100 and hexo at 50 and I can be happy üòÖ

It is statistically true. Go read the study in the original post.

Honestly I yolo'd on $BB at 8.54, but after doing some DD (seeing all the üöÄüöÄ here) I'm probably holding for a few months at least.

Only on wsb do you find someone buying \~15k worth of calls for the wrong year but still going up 100%+
Arkk didn‚Äôt buy plntr it was Ark w. So probably
They sold their phone Ip to Huawei, they can't
I picked up 2 (I know, I'm not rich) $10 9/17c for BB a while ago.  I figured, why not.  I'm curious to see what they get up to this week.

Do not hesitate buying tommorow. It is never too late, look at GME. I bought today when it was already up 15 percent and expected a short term  correction but it continued to moon.
Wait till you open your trading account in the morning and your unrealized gains is gone.
Just bought a couple 1/22 $12c - will they print????
So excited for you. I remember my first real profit. And I cashed it out. $8000.00. Remember, you don't make or lose money until you sell. Avoid the negative news too. I can't tell you how many times I punched out due to negative news. One time it was NFLX. I bought super low and then around 2008 or 9 or 10, I forgot when but Netflix announced they were raising their monthly fee and lots of people were dropping the stock. I thought, well due to ignorance, I should too. I would have been a hundreds of thousandair if I had not. Just stick in there and Invest in companies that you truly feel are worth their weight in Gold. Can't go wrong with solid companies.
Watch Rogue Trader with Obi Wan. Movie about a dude YOLOing on futures and blowing up his firm.
NOW... We all decide when to sell and we all buy puts and make millions.
Cathie > Citi
Yea
Not gonna lie, GME, PLTR, CCIV and BNGO just might make me 100k this week. I'm fucking retarded
Look, i'll give you credit for the meme. But, your most recent pick was total disaster and it looks like you spend most of your time making youtube videos.  Sooo i now believe your DD is garbage. See ya at $60.
Yes **buying MORE**
No point spending money on depreciating assets
$15 tomorrow.
What was the PLTR news?  +6% AH
Hey thanks
There a bunch of index funds that have done better than 15% on their 10-year annualized returns. I wouldn't call it "incredibly difficult".

Tbh it's kinda retarded to say it's $2,000 at this point if they only give a remaining $1,400 - why not just say here's $800, congrats on your $2,000 and account for the first cheque too.
Yessss
Yeah that's what I was thinking and it could mean disaster for a few/lot companies they own. Future will tell I suppose.
why the fuck did the GME shares go from 25k to 100k with smaller percentage fees?

Step 1) short squeeze GME üöÄ ‚úî

Step 2) EXCERSIZE your GME contracts mid week next week and HOLD!

Step 3) Hold half your profits in GME shares and take the other half and buy what traditional investors would call you a retard for... ridiculously risky PLTR calls! (They are sooooo not risky if we all do this and get fucking rich together lads!!!üöÄüöÄüöÄ)

Do you mean this? 

It didn‚Äôt touch on how worthless puts affect share price though. I understand how they‚Äôre fked if it‚Äôs a short naked call. But I thought long puts are just turning into worthless paper instead?
Once again inversing wsb pays off
$15 bucks an hour makes you RICH AF guys

Bought some  pltr
Ok this stock was up 22% today and then 15% more after hours.... What gives?
This sub sometimes is ridiculously smart but holy shit does it's actual stupidity outshine it. ICLN is a fucking ETF. How may times you actual retards need to hear this? I'm seeing dozens of comments here pointing out that ICLN being up 1% AH is disappointing. That's what an ETF does you fucking potato brain. I literally cannot wait for all of you idiots to get out of this ETF so it can go back to having another 150% gain over this year.
GME is where everyone with PS5s are now spending their money on games.
Actually they're only accumulating as I have BB calls

Shame you didn't wait another day for those calls as it looks like you would have had more money tomorrow, but good for doing the smart move.

Anything in particular causing the recent excitement in Bb?
PLTR mooning after hours probably because of ARK's trade email. They bought a lot of PLTR shares today. I think last time they bought some was in November.

He had to sell because he owned more than a 20% stake in the company. I believe he sold most of it yesterday. He would‚Äôve sold if it had been at $3 or $300.
Yes
I‚Äôve had a hard time finding vehicles to reduce tax liability, any suggestions? (Not being sarcastic)

I cannot fund a traditional IRA due to my income level, outside of that I‚Äôm maxing out my HSA but that‚Äôs a max of what like $3600 or so a year which is shit.

Yeah, it is 26.56 right now AH.
Well, there are a couple of ways I‚Äôd suggest:

1. Use some scanners. And not only stock scanners but also news.
2. Pick a sector, navigate.
3. Which I am guilty of: find few successful traders and follow them (as in, follow their strategy in terms of how to scan and conduct DD). Once in a while you get to see some stocks that made it on their radar and could be worth spending some researching those.

I think when we speak penny stocks... scanners are best for scalps and swings. But then again, you may stumble across a gem once in a while. I can‚Äôt stress how important it is to do your own DD, especially on penny stocks.
It's so lame.

Big up, big down. Usually settles slightly undervalued then slowly moves back to "normal" movement. So 2 questions remain, how big will the squeeze be and what is actually fair value. 

I think fair value is ~$60. Yes, that's near ATHs, but GME was valued $60 with DOUBLE the existing shares. So that's $30 based on previous ATH valuation. Very reasonable with RC at the helm.
It was hilarious because when it was going up 4 or 5% day after day a month ago, I was making about 25% or more on my calls. Just fucking disgusting gains day after day after day.
The only limit is your imagination, or possibly the moon

GM still got room to run?

i sold a little bit to get to a round number....... does that count?

That said, is the SEC taking notes \*scribbling in notepad\* 'wallstreetbets plotting to destroy short sellers' now we're going to login one day and see giant crime bureau tape on the front of wsb and its shut down.  Thanks, Cramer!
i like this analogy

You'll be having steak and lobster by the end of it.
can a motherfucker get some BBM back?  Bitches in high school loved BBM
I think ICLN just needed to get settled back to it's moving average for the last year, it jumped pretty heavily recently. Hopefully/probably Biden's plans will get it moving again
Anybody else bullish on inflation?
Mods we need Cramer to do AMA here
So you can make your stock unavailable for borrowing by setting a limit to sell order. All my GameStop shares that aren‚Äôt in covered calls I save set a ‚Äúlimit to sell‚Äù meaning they are unavailable to be borrowed because they are committed. I have limit to sell at like $100 $200 and $300. It means if the stock hits that price it automatically sells my shares but also that they aren‚Äôt available for someone to borrow and sell
Glad to have you on a winning team
I‚Äôve been thinking about getting the PS5 but it wouldn‚Äôt be the digital only version...why you ask? Because when I want a new game a year from now and the wife says ‚Äúget some of the other games you don‚Äôt play anymore and trade them in‚Äù guess where I‚Äôm going? GME

Ngl I miss the ü•≠ speeches. 

Dude was so fuckin funny.
A handful of RH users, and those on any other platform. This site only counts RH holders, which makes it pretty unique.

Depending on the stock it could be a hand full of old super owners with most of the shares slowly selling, or previous bagholders from way back. A lot of penny stocks used to be 10 bucks and such years ago and tanked or diluted. Sometimes our graph doesn't go back far enough, but there are only a few ways to go public. Uplist from otc, IPO, spac merger or those split off and reverse merger styles. Depending on the source those current owners could be way down or way up. And sometimes a few people hold so dang much it is crazy. Lastly, new shares can be offered in different dilution causing ways, direct offering type ways etc. For stocks that existed but needed more capital to continue their plans. Same company, same overall-ish worth, but now split among more shareholders.

So, could be an old dead stock someone is happy to be out of finally, an uplisted, an IPO gone poorly, or a slowly diluted stock that just never had the capital to achieve its goals. Either way, someone owns them, and Robinhood folks are buying from them to show up on this graph.
Is it true ARK purchased 50 million dollars worth of PLTR shares in the afterhours?!?!?!
My GME and BB stocks doing good. Sounds like a discount on tech though

Ok so I missed the speech tonight...any good news for steel?
All my meme stonks are like 2% green?
This is, by far, the funniest meme I've seen here.

Hats off to you sir.
Will my PLTR 29c 1/15 print tomorrow?
Oh ok thank goodness. I saw this and almost thought it was similar to an offering, lol. Totally different though, I see now. Thank you for the clarification!
I am full YOLO on BB after being YOLO on GME and TSLA.  This is the way.
This makes me genuinely happy for everyone that cashed in. Congrats retards!
If you think bears here are annoying, go to Stocktwist or Yahoo. They're losing their shit about $GME lmao.

Im up 130% on GME shares, up 15% on BB (i bought today), up over 150% in CRSR and 60% on NIO.

I swear every single stock this sub suggets works if you're just smart enough to not bet your house on weeklies. Thanks for making me so much money guys, i appreciate it.
This.  New to the investing world.  Only one week in and I've already noticed that if something ended trending quite high, the next morning you should expect a dip  and buy within 30-60 minutes of opening.  

Does this tend to be the case for most pennies?  Or am I only paying attention to the most volatile ones?

Well I don't know a ton about it as I had to make my decision quick as I noticed it popping off early afternoon. From what I was quickly able to read is that it is a long term cgm where as others on the market are more temporary and have to be replaced more often. Hoping to get some reading done this evening and to verify that and other things.
People who watch Cramer have no idea what Reddit even is
Fake sell off by low volume PJ traders. Dip will get bought up at open.
Holding shares is helping. dont sell
GME gang what a great fucking battle today once again..

Instead of closing, the shorts are doubling down and suppressing the price hoping the hype for GME will fade and the volume will drop. 

The short interest is still absolutely insane and we will find out tomorrow for definite the numbers on it.

Possibly once in a lifetime play

Enjoy.

I think it'll get through with it.  Hopefully they at least delay it by a year or two before it takes effect... because raising min wage like that will only increase unemployment and kill the almost dead small businesses.
Nope, he will have his buying power slashed by about 120% in your state. And, he will not get a pay raise as that money is allocated to the welfare wage.

Is that‚Äôs $20 in 2023 or 2020 money?
Yes, you should be investing your retirement savings not letting it sit in the settlement fund, usually employer retirement plans have a set of specific fund options, log on to your account and it should show those options, if you can't find it then try customer service for guidance, it's possible your plan allows you to pick any fund Schwab has to invest it, though that's a bit more rare to have available

Yep, 497k shares.
I have seen dozens of comments since after Biden saying they're getting out of it because it's only up 1%. Sorry but those retards need to be called out. And don't kink shame me.

PLTR after hours... its time..
Ok gld and slv. Time to get really worried about inflation with all this money flyin around everywhere. Let me see slv 25 tomorrow and ill throw all my gains into anything cathie tells me to
People bitching about ICLN not making them money or making them lose money... Are you guys dumb? Their top two stakes are  PLUG and ENPH! These two are at a ridiculous ATH! We just saw analysts take a shot at PLUG and that made ICLN take a hit. ENPH will probably follow suit, affecting ICLN as well. With that said, I don't see ICLN moving up like it did these last couple of weeks until the new administration starts signing things into action early Feb. 

I had $30 calls for 3/19 that I got in early december and I'm glad I got out. ICLN will probably dip soon because of PLUG and ENPH and when that happens, I'll jump back in again.

Yes. It‚Äôs ridiculous
If you out any stock in PE ratio Facebook is actually undervalued compared to average S&P stock. Trefis estimates say it vastly undervalued as well, they put it at 321. Not that either of these metrics are 100% reliable but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a stretch to call FB value at this price.

figure out how much $15 an hour is as a salary. it's absurdly low, no one can have a life or future on that. and the bumfuck states in certain parts only have those types of jobs so that means everyone needs to move to cities.
They already owned 1.9 million prior to today. But yes this confirms by bias even further so I'm in.

Said in the coming weeks
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-package-details-checks-unemployment-minimum-wage.html

 "The second bill, expected in February, will tackle the president-elect's longer-term goals of creating jobs, reforming infrastructure, combating climate change and advancing racial equity."

Combating Climate Change is loosely thrown in to the article.

Not sure about the flair.
Love those holdings
I FOMOd hard into G I K. Am I still going to print?
I like to read this. I missed GME and got ran over hard on me Tesla short (should have known better!) so I‚Äôm hoping BB has a similar meteoric rise. I ain‚Äôt selling for a while. That‚Äôs why I bought my calls out so far.
Usually they auto sell, not auto exercise. Institutions buy that shit up in droves because it is basically risk free profit that only requires a ton of capital.
Goddamn üåàüêª pajama traders shorting the market

Idk but we really can‚Äôt be far off... everyone and their grandma is buying stocks based on hype and what‚Äôs hip and cool. I really don‚Äôt see TSLA reach $1000 before it pops
Knowing me I would have panic sold for a loss anyways so probably for the best
Why is every Tinder bio ‚Äúloves to laugh‚Äù. Wtf does that even mean lmao

There‚Äôs some truth to what you say. But for OP, it‚Äôs better to have made mistakes now when the stakes are low, learn why he made them, and learn how to fix it, than to make a load of money cos the market is up and then lose it all because he makes a stupid play doing something that he never had the chance to learn was a mistake, if you get what I mean?

Damn this guy out here raking in millions and im cumming to my gain of 10k LOL
Good news for socialists
Question from someone without any kind of position in GME - why don't they take advantage of the price, and do an offering?
You never exercise... But whatever, more GME shares baby
Sleepy joe more like MASSIVE HULK COCK JOE
BREAKING: Cathie woods PT for PLTR Is 100

This is gonna suck when 100$ buys us half the bags of groceries we get now lol. Is inflation not a concern? Seems like we have one foot in one foot out with our plans battling covid and its just draining the economy instead of taking full measure.

I hope I‚Äôm in for 1,300
Sold a July 30c on my only 100 shares monday. Had to buy that shit back for 900 yesterday once i saw the squeeze was on. Thankfully got to it just as it was crossing 30. That call is worth at least $1700 now. Never sell CCs on meme stocks. Ever.
Cathie just throwed her dump truck in your face.

Why i said "slightly" against it 

Id prefer bigger stimulus and extend the unemployment benefits period and unemployment benefits qualifications
It picks up at where ever the orders price it at. I think AH and PM orders are only good for that session. Meaning the PM orders would have to be new orders, not carry overs. That doesn't mean the prices have to be different, but it means they probably are to some degree.

Sorry I should have been more specific. Which ark fund? Arkk or?
They do. But please check out most ARKs over a span of a week. They have had many weeks of being stale or red. You deal with that so that you can be around for the many, many green days.

My main concern is about how long will this last?
If this squeeze finishes next week, I might baghold on the puts I sold. 

What is a realistic price we might be back at after squeeze has squozen? Is it in the $35 range? I hope it is at least that or more.
üòçüòçüòç
I came thank you
They literally cant
There's over 1 million people in this group dude hahaha
Cuz if they don‚Äôt I‚Äôll be broke
So if they exercise the put that means they have to sell the shares at that price. Do they have shares to sell?

If so, it won‚Äôt affect the price, right? Shares are being bought and sold, issued ones are not being bought.

if they have to buy shares to cover, would they buy from the existing issues shares? I‚Äôm confused.
You can go to the ark website and subscribe to their daily buys
Okay? So go petition your state to raise the minimum wage. 

There's no reason for the federal government to get involved.
So the government giving my money back or redistributing wealth is a stimulus? How nice of them.
where do you follow those moves?
If you are moving to Asia I wouldn't buy. If you are fine with living with your parents just keep doing it, who cares (guessing you might be Asian? me too). Personal space would be less needed after the pandemic is over would be my guess.
How do you think they'll do on earnings on the 2nd? Worth getting in now or could there be a potential dip?

No, we need minimum wage, full time work to be properly compensated.

I don‚Äôt see Bezos out here on the COVID frontlines, bagging my fucking groceries or working the pharmacy.
Same $55/share sounds like a deal tomorrow üòµ
I believe that the fair price of the company right know is about 20 billion and keep in mind and that's without the premium that most investors are ready to pay for growth tech stocks. That is almost 30 percent upside. With the wsb hype it might reach 15 tommorow üöÄüöÄ
Threesome with cathie and AOC would be epic

Bought in fact 400K shares not 25K
Cause they'll fuck us right in the ass and it'll go back to $20. They can offer once we reach $100
Was literally just going to post something about this. GME was the first stock I ever wrote covered calls for. I wrote about 3 of them and I was actually thinking that after the one I have that expires this Friday, I would just hold the stock.


Sure enough the stock sky rocketed and my shares will be called away tomorrow. It's a weird feeling. I'm about to net a good chunk of change but it just feels like I'm saying goodbye.

I figured a pretty good price in general for the stock, so i sold a 1/22/21 37p @8.36 figuring 29 per share would my spot. Sure as shit , the stock took off more. So unless this thing crashes, I'll be collecting more premium.

It's weird because I actually wanted to be assigned.

I am using TDA and have a giant warning telling me about my margin call.

The first line is very direct - *You are in a margin call*

Then the explanation is the exact opposite -

*A potential maintenance call means action may be required if your account goes into a call. *

So it calls it 'potential' and says action 'may be required' but only if the 'account goes into a call'

So if the account doesn't go into a call, then it's irrelevant right? Even then there's no forced call options that have been bought, so no action at all would lead to me going into a call.

Is this right and it's just trying to cover their asses?

The first thing you read though is that *'you are in a margin call'*
This should be given ALL the medals

It's not just EVs, there will be an increasingly heavy push to shift away from fossil fuels and into clean energy this decade.  That sentiment is not going away ever.  Either the world funnels an enormous amount of money into clean energy or climate change fucks the planet and stocks are screwed anyways.  But it will take a long time and oil could easily continue to see a huge rise.  Nonetheless, disruption is here to stay and I would never bet on oil for that reason, but I sure as shit won't be shorting it either.

Day 2 of rampant growth out of iunno... a whole ass month. Seems pretty early.
Believe me.
Word on the twitter. by our GME expert u/Uberkikz11 aka Rod. is that OCC is opening $75 strikes tomorrow. One day after $55 (badly wanted 30 of those bad boys but IV was too much for me).

These might be more affordable.
Tomorrow is green and you know it.

Which stock? Volatility of the stock might have changed.
I would also guess that GME is not a great example since they are in a short squeeze. I really don't see LEAPS on them being smart for a long hold.
Possibly, but when it was deleted it had like 100 upvotes and not much activity, so I doubt that we had the power to pump it so hard. It tested $2 in the AH. We‚Äôll see tomorrow at the bell, but I think it‚Äôs more than just it.

You realize schools have more pressing needs than ‚Äúinnovative tech‚Äù, right? Budgets have been cut nationally for years now. Listen to what people are telling you, any additional funding is going towards survival.

If you‚Äôre so sure about stimulus spending guidelines, then invest in companies providing services that will satisfy those requirements. But if those guidelines are about teacher salaries, or school lunches, or after school activities, you‚Äôre out of luck.
Yeah but Biden is black while Obama was only half.
Apha is 12.70 and Tilray is 19.50 currently, so yes it is a discount to buy APHA. Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. If you get 0.83 shares of Tilray, it would be worth more than 1 share of APHA at current prices.

Trading spreads on futures options with basically no volume is [so much fucking fun!](https://i.imgur.com/iMqKrna.png) I thought the price glitched but with /RTY finally selling off a tiny bit AH the market makers made the bid ask fucking outrageously wide.

Who needs analysts anymore? I grew up with Value Line, it was fantastic. Then the internet made it obsolete. So, who listens to these "experts," in a field where experts fail a bunch?
People are scared that they will have to shut down the DAPL (they won‚Äôt) which still does not justify how far they dropped. People don‚Äôt like their former CEO and founder Kelsey not Grammer. He kinda just also expanded and never cared about debt. Now he stepped down (in November I think?) and the CFO is now calling shots and he dosnt love debt. So that should make people feel warm and cozy. Barclays just upgraded them this week to overweight and raised their target to $10 from $9. It‚Äôs like the printer is on, just need WSB to
Load the paper!
They'll operate here but they'll incorporate elsewhere - they already somewhat do this so hardly propaganda. So gov can still lose on corp taxes.

There are real economic implications of *raising* taxes. That's why it's a contractionay policy.

How can you hate ZOM??? Its a company that looked to rebuild itself not to long ago. Targeting a HUGE market that's only accelerating, with people staying home for covid. Their machine right now only does a couple of test but the machine is able to be update over the internet like a tesla. And its scalable meaning new test will be able to be implemented thru their machine. Sure there's some equipment that do some of these test. But they are bulky and outdated.
Big fuck. Shares gone.
Reddit will always get it both wrong and right, there's nothing that everyone would agree on or that stock would be obviously priced that way.  It depends on who you listen to and why.  There are dozens of posts here every week shitting the bed and dozens as well hitting the jackpot.
Is this DD or what
Yes. They‚Äôre rolling it out based on IQ in descending order. You‚Äôre scheduled for 2022.
This is what I should have done.  I stupidly sold $30 covered calls so I'm watching my gains sail on without me as the price continues to go up.  I'll still have 53 shares after tomorrow, but I should have sold puts instead of covered calls.  I'm still locked in for 100% gain on those shares ($13.87 purchase price) but damn it hurts to watch this continue to climb.  Lesson learned; albeit an expensive one.  Right now I'm leaving almost 4k on the table thanks to my stupidity.

I have literally no knowledge on the subject, but one thing I thought about is that an offering would make it easier for the shorts to close positions without causing the squeeze. Maybe they just don‚Äôt want to help out the people that were betting on them going bankrupt?

Yea I bought a ton when the last DD about this came out. Since then it has dropped about 5%, so it's an even better time to buy. However, I'm not sure that calls, ESPECIALLY 2/19 calls are the move. I believe the last post said that the next results on the treatment will be in 44 weeks or so.

Do you say no on PLTR because of the skyrocketing happening tonight? Also, why do you say no to ICLN? Sorry for dumb questions, new to this and trying to learn
So... Do you become the new mod now?
$ROPE
Isn‚Äôt that just the best feeling
...fuck it, I'm buying LEAPs
I like how nothing in your text/comments say GME be we all know what this is
He is a full time trader I believe.  He tracks thousands of companies and researches promising ones for hours and hours.  He built a thesis for gamestop over 1.5 years ago when he notes discrepancy between market sentiment and actual objective information about company financials (essentially, everyone was betting that the company would go bankrupt, but the company financials demonstrated that that was highly unlikely. Plus there were several likely catalyst for upward price movement and reversion to fair value.  Hence his name - he looks for deep value in companies - its a recognized method of investing (value investor).  
    His posts inspired me to learn more myself
We won't know for sure until the January 31st when we get the report update. The recent surge is due more to Ryan Cohen stepping in with two others in my opinion. With the amount of shorts out there I think that the actual squeeze will be more drastic. I could be wrong though.
Mama Cathie buying more PLTR
Thank you, but I sold at open and went all in on gme with my remaining 10k
thanks for this useless comment
Don‚Äôt see it.
Are you me?

(Twice‚Äî$EQOS and $MARA, same day)
‚ù§Ô∏è
we good we good
Shit yeah I love when I blindly buy things that end up having a catalyst the next day
I do dabble in puts from time to time, but I sleep so much better when I'm in calls. 

Probably because I'm not fighting nature.
Lol last thing I ever will be is a bear. I am actually a PLTR call holder.
You gotta be trolling
Your boyfriend's wife's dongus.
Buy the fucking dip! üöÄüöÄüöÄ GME ONLY GOES UP
Could you explain this please
Smol
At the advice of this thread I YOLO‚Äôd half each into  FOMO BB and GME shares.  If the squeeze don‚Äôt get squoze tomorrow then I guess we‚Äôre all retarded. ü§°
Because he actually bought puts
Same I‚Äôm at 250 shares at $0.39. Let‚Äôs get it.
I see you PLTR!! I was wondering how my account jumped in an hour lol
Finally might get back that dipshit move of buying in at 30 the only time it fucking reached it.. I was in early too but it took a chunk of my gains when in tanked
Wells Fargo mooning after earnings tomm
Holding leaps

Fuk it I‚Äôll buy a few calls
make sure you don't have an open stop or limit

Lol fuckin hold onto it, it‚Äôs only going up
Palantir
I‚Äôm with ya brother. Rodney King said it best. Can‚Äôt we all just..get along..
If PLTR hits $100 before 2/19 I will have 120k to my name
There is no point buying stock where you have no legal claim on anything. You may as well buy baseball cards.
Sir this isn't WSB
Seriously. Dropped $45 on it, lol.
Go back to r/investing nerd.
1/22 GME 69c
The best way is to just take the plunge. Whenever you're unsure of how to do what you're trying to do, just google how to do that specifically. This is what I did. Also, they have a concierge that you can call for a 1-hour personal tutorial which was very helpful. ToS is very powerful and I highly recommend it.
not too late, see you at $20
Also Theres no end to chip shortage, tarriffs. War with intel will be much worse now that they got new engineer ceo.
they can't even spell motors right. lol good luck with this pump and dump
Was it worth all the stress tho
Not so sure about the linux version but i know it exists!

Why tf is there no wsb ETF?? If we could only unite we'd all be rich af
how many of you are holding calls overnight?
America is a scam lol. Once I realized a man could con his way into the white house, and vegas was built on literal mob bosses, I said why not just join em. lol
hell yeah dude
Oh man..  that sucks.  They are only going up from here IMO so maybe jump back in.  I have a bunch of shares @ 7ish so assuming my cc gets assigned I still take a profit.  Didn‚Äôt expect it to jump this hard so fast though. üí®üöÄ
I'm debating on putting $5k in BB right now. This would actually be first stock investment. Would this be wise of me?
That's an aggressive strike price

Buying ICLN 1/21/22 tomorrow morning. There is no downside
Thank you mama cathie
Generally there is some premium but not a lot because of arbitrage.
Fucking heartwarming stuff, you love to see it
I need Elon to post a pltr lotr meme so I can cash out already

I cry more everyday
Let's fucking goooooooo!!!!! üöÄ üë©‚ÄçüöÄ üë®‚ÄçüöÄ üöÄ 
$BB
Bless her beautiful soul
Assume he paid a premium of 0.1 per share on the contract.

$0.1x100=10

As the stock price goes up, so does the premium per share. Assume the premium jumped to $1 per share.

$1x100=100.

He can now turn around and sell that call and make $90 in profits on the premium without exercising the call at all.

$90/$10=900% profit.

Full disclosure I'm a super noob retard and learned this from a YouTube video yesterday.
Thank Cathie
We don‚Äôt know
You only bought 3? How poor are you?!
What is BB projected to hit tomorrow? bc even throwing down 2k on BB and it jumping to 15 would make a net of $800 or so
Me yo
Apha BB and HUT
Solid DD.
GME
:) I like to meme but my wife is too important to me to meme. Stay cooleo Jolene
Lmao what did you do with $100
Not exactly, would be really sad to be stuck with stagnant stocks while others are doubling their money
Why are you like this?!
Screw that guy he's messed up in the head
GME puts?
GOGO
Yuge info.
He was in a coma.
It means you're using margin and you don't have enough money to cover the maintenance requirement. Tda will likely give you 5 days before taking action themselves. It's a potential call, because you have time to fix it
Stop hurting our feelings
That‚Äôs ur opinion and I respect it ü§ù
Imagine having to pretend you think Joe Biden is a brilliant orator 

Calls on AAPL earnings run up imminent
Anything with cathie wood is amazing
So I sold half of my PLTR shares and bought GME.  Very conflicted feelings right now
Yeah clear as day I expect a news release tomorrow pre market pump üöÄüöÄüöÄüõπüåïüåï
I said in my post but yea just sell a ITM put and get shares that way
So do you think I should go for the 35c or way otm 55c? 55c is only $16 per contract, but I‚Äôm new to options trading so wondering if there‚Äôs a huge difference between going 35c $74 vs 55c $16.
I'm already in on XOM. I'll be going in on BP on the morning most likely
HOES MAD. HOES MAD!
If you‚Äôre gonna say something like this at least elaborate
I hold BABA, NNDM, GME ... fuck the last days have been good
250 @ $0.39
Like hoW!?
Dollar cost averaging at all?
you just made a bunch of nerds cream their pants for no reason i hope you feel good about yourself. it's going to 100 but shame on you cnn!
Palantir the past two months, look at us now
Bought my first option yesterday/today 2 contracts @ 1/15 40c. averaging 3.03 per share.. does this = small or big tendies if it stays above 40 tomorrow, and when does one sell on expiration date
Anyone think we see a market pullback? Eur/Usd bear 5 year highs. I bought put mid-day and covered EOD Don‚Äôt get me wrong loving the gains but These small cap short squeezes seem like the final push.
No. Just adding info if someone thought she just bought in.
AI and data analysis/presentation. I've been long on them since they IPOd and kept buying more. I've worked with them twice, it really is an amazing product.
Is it too late to get in? I see some After Market pull back.

whats the 100 and then the 1000 though?
Probably not but that would be neat
yeah i had some amazon last year at 2000 and cashed out at 3100 but ive just been too nervous to hop back in at such a high price but then again 4k is just a matter of time. Amazon would be a long long hold for me anyway just like apple and CGC

Who buys puts? Have they not been paying attention? Are they so delusional, and lost deep inside their own assholes, that they can't hear or see anything right in front of them?
BB, GME, and PLTR til we are all millionaires
Maybe  only for certain accounts?
I wouldn't be surprised if they announce a new contract with the FBI soon.

AWWWWW SHEEEET MAMA CATHIE I WUV YOU!!!!!
It bought a contract that says it can buy GME stock for $55 tomorrow.  It probably did not pay a lot for that contract, but that doesn't matter because we're gambling.  When GME cruises past $60 tomorrow, OP will have tendies.

How would it be a short squeeze event?  How would one even short an OTC?  And the more likely answer is that it is a company focused on a clean hydrogen production method.  Clean energy will be big over the next few years.  Whether, HYSR tech is proven and profitable, I can't say...But it's one of the only plays in clean hydrogen.
She'll probably buy more, but...last part.

Thanks for putting it out there, people need to realize that once the mm‚Äôs can‚Äôt make a profit they will figure out an exit strategy to mitigate as much risk as possible. I can‚Äôt imagine Melvin and BofA getting margin called given the size of their assets, but I‚Äôm sure they are looking for an exit strategy and if the lending fee, along with the share price, is maintained at these levels they will have no other choice but to pull the trigger for MOASS. Small to mid-size Hedge Fund brokers are stuck between a rock and a hard place and will try to outlast this run, but will continue to be margin called (and possibly wipe out their assets) as the price continues to run.

Yeah naturally with the ETF that seems a real long play given the cultural shift still needed to reverse the damage done to MJ/hemp pretty much globally amongst the general population.

That being said it seems a better time than ever to jump on re: market pessimism regarding all the deregulations etc imo
Yeah, of course. Only makes sense for capitalists.
Whats the lockup? I'm retarded someone explain this please
I had 100 shares at average cost of 18.20. Then bought another 30 early today to really ram the point in. Fuck Melvin. /salute
Today's comments about wallstreetbets and young traders were the most respectful we have seen, let's take it as a win and give Cramer credit where credit is due.

Oh I‚Äôm with you I mean I‚Äôm loaded to the teeth in ICLN calls.. you think we‚Äôll get a pump tomorrow or no since he didn‚Äôt lay out the infrastructure plan and probably won‚Äôt until feb?

No you wasn't.
270 shares
close to the nadir
right here, we rich
Or just today
Just put on world war Z, last time I watched this we limited up.
Does the squeeze require margin calls on shorts, or just the price of the stock to go so high that shorts have no choice but to exit their position?
So my $30 calls for tomorrow might print more than 3$!!?
Not red now
Honorary seat on the board would be a nice gesture.
Yuh. Been in since early December. Getting tired of the am dumps
but still. Fuck taxes. why they gotta take my tendies
What makes this stock a fraud... they just went thru a name change and the sec investigates that when it happens.. so do tell me how they are a fraud company that just partnered with a fortune 200 company, opened a new subsidiary, had name change become official after passing the investigation needed from the dev for that to take place, hire Allen sossis.. do tell me where the fraud is? If you can ?

Don‚Äôt lie to me boys, I made a mistake. I felt kinda edgy one night and bought a NIO leap ($80c Jan 2022), I‚Äôm not a communist I just wanted tendies. I just wanna either breakeven or take small profit and get out of this. Down -2.51% already done with it after 3 days.
I just been throwing small amounts from 500-1k at it and expecting to lose it all.

So far its paid off pretty fucking well. Dont panic of it falls 2 or 3 points after you buy, its been doing that shit
your calls are going to 10x from 1 cent to 10 cents! congrats bro!

I Googled it awhile back. She's added a million shares at ~16 I believe.

It's in her arkw fund.
It'll pump up until Feb 14 so don't sell just yet
Fuuuck yeah scrow

This might be the best non loss porn post in the history of WSB
Same dfv hand those calls
Earnings is tomm bud. Stock is on a tear past couple months
Why?
What stocks did you buy? Im gonna guess that you found some sort of up and coming stocks or some stocks that spiked with the Biden election win.

You are technically a first time trader, but seeing as you already put a lot of front end research in with reading multiple books, its hard not to classify you as someone who has atleast some expertise. 

Me personally I've had 60% returns over the past half year, and thats from trading meme stocks picks on here but also looking up stock studies from topics I read about on here as well as Bulkowski's stuff both of which I've been implementing more recently.

You staying in that? I sold today.
Ban. This guy is so stupid.
AAPL continues to break my balls. My back. And least importantly, my heart.
Wait serious question, do you think GameStop will continue to generate good sales in the future?
Ummm, no. GME at $5 was already ridiculously undervalued. The assumption was they were going down the drain and wouldn't pull off a turnaround. GME at $20-$25 is probably a reasonable valuation for the current state of the business if they were to hold steady. Cohen brings growth potential to the table.
If it‚Äôs hit 35$ before 1/29 I will have 300K.
Preach, all the fighting is pathetic. Our ancestors died for our right to disagree, we should show them some respect.
We are all part of this history in making. Thanks to people like you.Congrats Man..BBBY still a buy after the run today?
that's a great question. The answer isn't easy. Whenever you feel comfortable with the profit you've gained, get out. It's fine. Profit is profit. Just know that we're not even close to the ceiling.
Deadass it‚Äôs accounts I‚Äôve never seen before pumping BB

GME squeeze isn't over
Black rock reported better than expected earnings and stock dropped...financials are gonna take a swift kick in the nuts as long as the Fed holds rates down. Good luck. When the pain subsides tomorrow, yolo over into GME
Followed you on twitter. Amazing results. For your options, Are you theta gang? 

Or are you buying naked options or debit spreads ?
I'm talking about when you have to close your short position because your broker is calling it in, not when you open a short sale. You have to return an actual share of the stock to your broker to cover your position, and that share has to come from somewhere.
RIGHT HERE BRO

I'm holding some shares but I was gonna buy some calls tomorrow. Still gonna tho
Because everybody needs to sleep eventually, and nothing sucks more than stonks shitting the bed at 2am for no god damn reason.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying!

Breaks his silence for love's sake. Who says there's no romance in trading?
Everyone saying even a retard can go positive in a "raging bullmarket", will be losing a lot once its not this insanity anymore. Maybe OP isnt just gambling with the odds being in favor of him but actually trying to understand whats going on. Its always easy to be an ass on the internet and look down on people, guess what professional traders probably have a good laugh at you daily. Luck is luck, but you cant buy dedication and willpower.

Ill gladly be accepting downvotes from the people of the salt.
Also:

‚ÄúHospitalized COVID-19 patients were 45% less likely to be current smokers than patients who had been admitted with other respiratory viral infections the previous year.‚Äù
Right, unless you're the market maker.
T mobile is gonna shoot up tomorrow, it‚Äôs down considerably the past week but so have most. I think when the market get optimistic tomorrow it‚Äôll shoot back up. 

It fell from 136 to 125 a share. There earnings last quarter were amazing, and they‚Äôre leading 5g. Earnings will be released in February then it will really pop.

T-Mobile is becoming the Tesla of cellular companies. It‚Äôs winning the 5g race by a long shot. Hell one of these days it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they overtook spectrum for internet service when 5g is everywhere.

Anyways buy TMUS. Thank me later
It‚Äôs difference between short term vs long term capital gains. If held less than a year, you get taxed at federal income tax levels. So marginal rate of 35% for this. LT which means held over a year is 15%. So significant difference. Also need to take into account individual state capital gains taxes on top of it. 

Day trading would obviously mean it‚Äôs held less than a year.
Imagine thinking your money is retaining value when the interest rate is anything below 3%
SPCE will rocket
Silver never moves.

Yes there is a difference, but as soon as I buy the stock it is a sunk cost. Keep that mentality and you can push through the pain.

nah bro, the best weeks we're in the fkg summer bro, and maybe in November when shit like CRSR, GME, PLTR, AND NIO all mooned together everyday basically. That was something.

I like what I'm reading so far, but I'm really not good with pharma stocks. What does "an ongoing Phase 2/3 clinical trial" mean in terms of timeline and likelihood of approval? 

Any drug that puts a dent in the negative impact of Alzheimers would be huge.
Honestly, Eurobeat is fucking amazing.
That's not how it works. Low prices lead to higher demand.

Besides, if you would read the article, they're not stopping fishing, they're catching the same fish, the difference is they're taking the catch to Denmark where the prices haven't collapsed due to Brexit's red tape.
I‚Äôm holding a shitload of puts
GME
Yeah, but like 10 guys here account for over 90% of the holdings. The vast majority are here for scraps and lols.
Expects me to have the patience to sit on a call for a couple months and see it barely go up everyday... smh. 10 bagger or bustüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Since I started trading futures a few weeks ago, options are kinda üò¥üò¥üò¥, like stocks....basicaly just like how stocks became boring after learning all about trading options. If you think options are volatile... the smallest unit of change, or one tick of the price of one  /VX contract is worth +/- $50. One tick, or "$0.25" change in the price of corn futures is +/- $12.50. Insane leverage. The futures that you guys (...ok we tbh lol) stare at all night has a tick value worth $12.50. So if you were long/short one futures contract and it happened to go up 0.5% that night, your contract would be worth +/- $950. That's why I havent been posting much here lately, but I think FDX calls, or some call debit spreads a month or two out should print. I'm convinced it bottomed out after drilling for like a month straight.

It also feels kinda ridiculous to see SPY above $380. Like 7 months ago it was barely above $300... what a miserable "recession."
Probably citibank buying PLTR after they downgraded it like 2 days ago. Those fucks
Every once in a while I get the notion that I want to sell cars.  BUT - I would be the guy at the dealership going "no, that sounds like you want a Subaru, and not this Volvo". 

I also don't see myself working more than 2-3 days a week or maybe by appointment. 

I can't imagine any dealership wanting to put up with that.   Basically, I want to sell cars so I can sell the right car to the right person. Not so push something into spending more on something they don't need. 

But I still love the idea. 

It's entirely possible that I could work at the local Tesla dealer. We can't sell them in my state, so all I'd do is test drives and information.
What is it about James Cordon that makes people want to shit on him all the time? He hasn't raped anyone, hasn't murdered, hasn't done any thefts, and yet people hate him.

But support support a failed coup d'etat because you wanted to rob a country of what little lithium they had, and all you retards want to suck that person's dick and call him daddy.

Hate the people who try to make you laugh, love the people who support violent revolutions. I bet most of you are conservatives. Makes complete sense.
Well not out of the mmmmmm woods yet. 26 after hours, maybe it will pop tomorrow.
Hold !!!!
Citi downgraded it. Means only one thing to the moon and above.

Diversification is for idiots. Look at Buffet‚Äôs portfolio, it‚Äôs highly concentrated.

Pretty new to this still, would GME be a bad investment? Guessing short means just a buy and sell as soon as it's gone up a bit? 
Is it more of a hold stock or just a bad buy as it's basically a dying market?
But it‚Äôs not a joke
To late for pltr

JPMorgan just downgraded PLUG and FCEL must not have learned what happens when a bank downgrades our stocks. Even the üåàüêª are posting articles on seekingalpha shorting FCEL.
The PLTR pump from Woods will then pump ARKK which will in turn pump PLTR which will pump ARKK into an infinite pump continuum
This is the top - of WSB
Goddess Cathie. I will be your personal foot stool.
That is good enough for me!
shoulda bought options way more potential upside
so probably a slow migration for that piece then

Who knows, by the time they start putting their silicon in the Pro series stuff they might have it figured out. They may also be better able to optimize the lower spec stuff since they write all the software that runs the chip.
I'm pissed and probably soon to be fucked
Not exactly no stress, but I really would like to be a mountain guide for extra money and to get outside more.

Can we ban people who add a ticker and say it's a short squeeze? Like, it's not. GME is. But anything else isn't. Except maybe one of the tickers that starts with a B (BB, BBBY, etc)
Your equity balance is below your margin maintenance requirement. If you don't fix it (by selling securities and/or depositing cash), they'll call your margin by selling off your assets for you.

Glancing back through some of his "investment thesis" videos in the past. Back on July 13, 2020, $GME made up 1.18% of his portfolio ([https://youtu.be/7wjWnMcdnlQ?t=2963](https://youtu.be/7wjWnMcdnlQ?t=2963)).

His entire investment thesis is about finding underperforming companies that are failing or at least trailing their peers, to see if they can come back (usually a reasonably deep dive into cash flows), management, industry, etc (including technical voodoo). He is the opposite of the meme stock investor, that's probably my favorite part.

That value is the full margin value amount though.

I did do a $3500 ACH transfer so that would be on margin.

But a margin call for all your margin doesn't make much sense.

Margin Balance is $5532 and Maintenance call is $5509
Y‚Äôall getting on the $BB train?
üòâ
Tuesday big red ?
Which one is lucid
A Friday pump is in order. Could use a happy ending
Done
First ones always free
Yooo  chill I‚Äôm just tryna learn from the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù
I want to hang framed photos of Cathie Wood and Jim Cramer in my office.
So ETFs aren‚Äôt allowed to go up? It‚Äôs been down all week.
Sooooooo we pumpin BB tomorrow or what?
PLTR below 30 is still a sad sight :(
Well, I guess we know who's buying first round when we're all millionaires! ;-)
Why are people so hype about PLTR, hasn‚Äôt done shit since November
Yoooo how long we we holding/buying GME shares? Lmao I‚Äôm down to buy a couple more shares Tomorrow
Got em
This is my first put. Trying to learn the basics still. Is that the bet that gme will be $45 in a week? Do I need the money to buy 100 gme shares? Cuz I don't have that on hand.
Tomorrow will be big red Dick day or ban me
What is done cannot be undone, but at least one can keep it from happening again. Just so you know, the correct spelling is [Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi).
PLTR
How long could this possibly go on for?
Yep, dumping it tomorrow.  Should moon on Tuesday now.
After a ‚Äúmajor cable network break,‚Äù CNBC workers counted ‚Äú18,000 market orders, all for GME‚Äù that they pulled from suitcases and with no SEC observers present.
SPY or SPX yolos?
Balls deep in shares doesn‚Äôt equal up votes
I don't have to imagine because I AM that retarded

1/15 $55c GME
1/15 $40c GME
Nope, they loaded up around 500k shares today. PLTR üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I‚Äôll make 2.25 mil if it hits 100 tm lmao

Can‚Äôt wait for TSM Q1 earnings. They‚Äôre going to smash the fuck of estimates
I forgot my busfare, can I ride with you?
Stonks
PLTR finally looking good AH. Let's hope it holds into the open.
Even ignoring the posts, just look the most recent earnings statement and then look at their market cap. DD complete
You thought 2020 was good....2021 to the moonnnnn
Your thread contains zero information about anything at all. In fact, it's such low effort, you're literally asking people how to use the search funtion or Google. THE LOUNGE was created specifically for posts like this. 

Your post is literally 2 sentences. "How do I search for stocks," and "Do you just pick random ones?" The main sub is not the place for posts like this.
BB ?
Yesssss
lolll dude imagine Jones soda goes to $5. Maybe I'll hop on some jones soda stock too lol, I mean what is there to lose?
Puts printing tmrw
Alright here is the play. $ELY. Callaway all the way for the tendies. Do your own research but if not know this, this is your chance.
Should WSB consider this as a Declaration of Independence ?
Sorry. Would like to see other professions ie teachers gain the same notoriety of our troops
That's a huge upgrade from the merrymen
I own a 1987 f-250. Best vehicle I've ever had. Sick commercial too.
His YT is pretty informative actually.  Should give it a watch.  Makes quite a bit of sense.
VIX FUTES BLOOD RED
What‚Äôre you holding for BB?
Lmao what? How much squeezing you think is going on here
Holding 30x 22 Jan 2021 $27 calls!
The man has to found a way to bring us back into the fold.  Fuck games stop for fucking me over in my youth.  Thank you Papa C for making it right.
And software, they're pretty undervalued as a well-performing software company because people still think they sell outdated phones.
Make recessions great again
So is CITI the new number one WSB's public enemy? They are shitting on our stocks.
"Emergency"

This is the longest fucking emergency I've ever heard of
So, buy lots of calls for shortly after demo day?
What about his twin brother, Kim Jramer?
üÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏è flavor of the week. Don't ask questions, just hit buy asap.
I can‚Äôt sleep thinking about the gains l, might as well stare at the lil green lines go up in bed for 6 hours
Holy fuck this is great
Us?
Bought 50 shares of $PLTR at $25.09 because everything I see mentioned on here goes up. I don‚Äôt even know what the fuck they do
Did joe pump icln
Oh hell yeah I love coinbase I want in
Going fucking *hard* on BB calls tomorrow
Half a million shares üöÄ
Run up to demo day üöÄ
Demo day üöÄ
PLTR 35 EOM üöÄüöÄüöÄ
pump it
That was a typo my bad, meant 81.5 calls
u/savevideo
Yes. IV is too high right now. Just buy shares and hold.
Most of the people on these forums just started in the past year.. we're the current generation ü§£

Come back in 3 - 5 years to see if EVs, PLTR, GME, and crypto worked out
BYND might keep ripping
American stamps are hot atm as after the civil war they will be rare collectables
I've started to shift to small caps now that these are stagnant. I still love these companies but I'm ok with selling a bit because the opportunity cost is too great.
I have watched all my GME bros march into battle while my funds are being held by the CCP. üá®üá≥
Too soon
Balls deep in GME PLTR ICLN, it's gonna like seeing your kids fighting to be the fav kid
It‚Äôs finally our time
**Honey, put my bathing toaster back on the shelf! :')**
Rough. I'm in a slightly less painful boat of having sold covered calls on all my shares of ARKK, right before TSLA's popoff from around 700 to 800+. Hoping to roll them up and forward till I eventually capture those gains.
\^
15 @ 39.61, I'm doing my part.
20,000 shares at .20 and I‚Äôm not selling anything until earnings are announced. We KNOW they have significant revenue coming it‚Äôs just that very few people know about it. On top of this Biden is going dump a shit ton into COVID testing and may even help streamline approval for them to become apart of vaccine rollout.
You know it lol
Meh. It‚Äôs nice I guess.
I can‚Äôt wait to wake up to my BB calls printing üöÄ
I too would like to know?
We are the knights who say NEE!!!!!!!!!!
What?
Did you do a shit ton in December?
Check out his YT - Roaring Kitty.  Explains it pretty well.
I did the same and also bought more, that's why I'm bagholding. I was up 300%, now it's worthless.
Why even ask that here unless you‚Äôre just seeking confirmation bias to buy GME?
gg, grats
Nah she doesn‚Äôt give a shiet WSB. Because PLTR was announcing some big contracts and new competition yesterday. Also BIG PUT is expired tmr. The downgrade from citipaperbank ain‚Äôt coincidence. I THINK NOT.
I'm a simple retard.

I see 3  üöÄ, I invest.
The meeting tomorrow or whatever
Who tf is Cathie and how does she like her ass ate?!?!?
I threw up looking at this.
Man, if ABNB having a market cap of 100B on 4B in revenue and a net loss isn't a bubble, I don't know what is.

Compare to Expedia which has a market cap of 20B, revenue of 12B, and net income of 500M. 

I think Expedia is going to pop much more than ABNB when vaccines hit.
Same...10k of 128
 Remindme! 74 days ARKX
She bought more today!

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
VALE popping to like $20 would be so awesome. Bought 60 19.5c‚Äôs for $.05 each for a YOLO.
My 500 shares in pltr will be happy
Next stop BBBY?
Gonna be just fucking awesome waking up to a port full of worthless calls, I can‚Äôt wait...  ü§°üî´
Don‚Äôt panic
You spelled 1000 eod Friday wrong
To what?
I already went all in on PLTR 1 and a half month ago lol. Best decision ever.
our troops are the only thing keeping the world together
He should donate 5 million worth of stock. It'll be 20 million in 6 months. Lol
The fate of my options account rests with GME 40c
Your efforts are appreciated but this type of post doesn't belong in the main sub and the rules couldn't possibly be any more clear about that.
No, if you currently have a long option contract then it means you're "paired" with someone out there who's short on the contract. Now if you sell the contract to me then I will be "paired" with that someone out there, and you'll be free of any obligations.
Pretty sure he's made a hell of a lot more than that.

This is likely one of his biggest winners, but as of July 13, 2020, it was only 1.18% of his overall portfolio. Meaning, at the time, his portfolio was at least $10m.
Any news or just letting everyone know?
S&P and Vix futures both red üßê
Cathie can take my babies
Not sure, but what Biden says vs what goes through Congress could definitely be different. I know Dems run the show now, but the razor thin margin in the Senate still means there are no guarantees on anything and making concessions could still very much be necessary.
Same. First thing I'm buying
I‚Äôm balls deep in GME right now can you say the same?
1/26
Yeah... not sure if that‚Äôs supposed to be .085??
Which ones
TSLA puts
I sold my AMZN shares today.  Wanted to free up some cash. I was holding out for over 3300 again but didn‚Äôt see it happening anytime soon.  Cost basis was just under 2500 so i said fuck it.  I honestly felt like i unloaded some bags.  I‚Äôll buy back if Jeffrey decides to split.
New to the gang as of 48 hrs ago and gotta say excited to be here
Fuck why did it dump today?
Green means go so you good
Let‚Äôs not forget the merge with PCTI who has had government and military contracts for 29 years.. lol
Are Comac and Xiaomi listed in the US stock exchange? I can't find them anywhere.
Anyone want to go all in on FB

This is a stock that is severely undervalued and the catalyst is earnings in 2 weeks.

Cathie just bought some today
Loaded on 4/16 20c, 6/18 22c, ready for them to start printing any day now.
>He just ~~sees the growing momentum, the shorts running out of ammo, now today all the boomer news sources pumping gme~~ some way or another acquired advanced knowledge that Ryan Cohen was interested in GME and would purchase a major stake in mid-Jan
When ppl ask DFV how he made it, he can literally say ‚Äúbc i believed in GameStop when the world didn‚Äôt‚Äù ...god status
Fuuuuuck
40c and 55c 

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
What's an "entry level job" these days? There are companies that try to get away with saying you need a BS in comp sci, know how to handle a LAMP stack, and be a "rockstar" (let us abuse you) for $15 an hour with shit benefits.
Ya know, if you'd ate that pussy good you might not've had one to begin with...

Shout out to all the stubborn PLTR bagholders and to Cathie Wood for the rescue.
And EV OS. Two big growing industries
I usually just trade a bunch lol
tomorrow's the big one. 50-60 tomorrow
I think it‚Äôs actually incredibly small short interest lol. Either way, to the üåô üöÄüöÄ
Not terrible price but u should aim around 3100 to buy in
Hmm maybe a lower strike? That's quite a bit of recovery. I know demand will be back up and its not perfectly priced in yet but its recovered quite a bit already?
uhh have you seen the world lately?
Buy more
There are a lot of benefits to being 1099.   I would appreciate that the government doesn't screw me out of those, along with raising my taxes, lowering my pay, and not giving me stimulus.   1/22 PLTR $35.
Can we ban doomer bear comments? they should just make their own sub
Nope virus talk taking lead. ICLN talk maybe in few weeks
We‚Äôre all about shit companies that are about to turn about bigly and run shit again, that‚Äôs why
i‚Äôm selling everything and going all in arkx when it launches
Also u guys see SRPT? Anyone buy after it crashed? It's been shaking people off all week... anyone have any 1/15 calls you think r gonna print?
$2m in retirement accounts or robinhood? I‚Äôm about 1/6 of the way to my number but it‚Äôs all in retirement accounts so I don‚Äôt know how to get from 43 to 55 yo.

This is the way
It‚Äôs been pretty good, picked them up at 14 along with BP and shell. European oil major playing oil and renewables yet XOM is the big oil that went up the hardest (waiting to short it)
Sold most of my PLTR on Monday to throw on GME. Sad I am missing the run finally. Still happy for you retards! üçÜüçÜüçÜ

It's an exercise in hindsight in any market.
Anyone got a link to some DD on BBBY?

Bought 50 pltr shares and 2 $27.5 feb 26 c‚Äôs today. Aint getting rich but lookin forward to seeing some greenery tomorrow its been a while
Tendie land
whaaaaaat?
Serious question:

I just opened up RH Gold, should I use margin to maximize this GME squeeze? Never used margin. Sounds riskayyyy

What‚Äôs the Pltr news?
Leap.... 3 days..... yep u belong here. 

Paper hands.
It's okay. We have a printing press. In fact, why do we limit ourselves to 2T if it's not bad? Why not a quadrillion instead? Because it seems like inflation is just a dark fantasy.

People complaining about futures must be new here. Here's a heads up for all you newbie boomers coming here from Cramer. Futures don't matter. At all. Over the last month I have had my worst days after nights of red futures and some absolute shit days with green futures. So put down you scotch pudding and stop yelling at the children riding skateboards down the street and realize that what you've been hearing about futures is BS. Ya fookin' boomah.
Yay me too
TO THE MOON
Yes, definitely. You should test all the pairs. How far back did you go on the 30 min?
What do we think about the upcoming bank ERs?

Hey thanks
Right now planning on seeing the very quick AM dip and putting it all into the next dollar up calls expiring same day
Wallstreetbets is the place smart people gather when they decide to turn their brains off for the day... :D
Hyper-Parabolic moves, long momentum, spiked volume, Cramer GME segment;
as we move closer to weekends paint a very grim picture for shorts. (VW short squeeze, anyone?)

Very, very deadly.
 Strong men create good forums.

Good forums attract weak men.

Weak men create bad forums.

~~Bad forums attract strong men.~~  Bad forums stay bad forever.
I have shares. Silver is like Frankenstein's monster. I'm fully expecting it to dip back to 18 or 19 again before it really moons to 30+. Or maybe the dip last month to 21.50 was the entry... only time will tell
Clown world, was 2020 not enough of a clue?
Up 6% in afterhours üò≥


https://imgur.com/gallery/d9Ynael
That would require shorts, BYND might be a better squeeze
BBBY, 1/29
The scary thing is those calls actually have a chance of actually ending in the money too. If that happens it's only going to teach these retards to keep buying absolutely moronic strikes like that. They'll be guaranteed to do it again and lose it all next time lol.
Yeah I‚Äôm a bag holder but it‚Äôs up 900% in under a year; just keep buying shares
And sold basically at expiration.

And been parlaying his option plays into just straight up shares.
Best buds.
Everyone raise you hands and give some energy to  ICLN    
It will rise Goku style
That‚Äôs good to see. I felt was so similar to the wsbgod fraud that I had my doubts about this whole phenomenon.
Care to elaborate...
Just don‚Äôt hold after earnings babe
Short means to basically bet it's going down, very bad idea in almost every scenario but in this case it would literally bankrupt you. GME is a good investment, buy shares and ride this shit to valhalla
I was holding NVDA from 2017 onwards. The sell off in late 2018 and early 2019 was extremely painful and mentally scaring/conditioning when it comes to my investing philosophy. Watching your shares tank 40% in value is an experience I honestly hope every investor will goes through once and only one time. After you go through it you stop caring so much about the intraday swings. This new cohort of investors who have made their money in 2020 need to experience a bear market to teach them some lessons on investing.
This place rules.
Time will $TELL
Well California voters just approved the abuse with prop 22, though at this point specifically limits it to transportation companies. Corps will take that opening and ram their indefatigable wedge into it until the vast majority of folks across industries no longer have unemployment, the right to organize, benefits or workers compensation.  Meanwhile Google just formed its first union last week. 

Always interesting.
He's starting to pull out?
Best description yet.
Early exercise of call options is only rational in certain circumstances, such as when there is a dividend in excess of the extrinsic value of the option, when liquidity is so poor that slippage would exceed the extrinsic, or sometimes to defend early assignment in multileg trades. 

Otherwise just sell to close.
Like most subs, people don't read the rules before posting, then are shocked when their posts are removed.  There are times here that a bunch of posts are submitted before the mod hammer can hit them, and it starts to look like /r/personalfinance.

I like the clean look of this sub.  Way nicer than subs where it's just the same old posts time and time again.
He is a total fraudster. I once attended his virtual course where you could apparently 'ask him questions' and it was exclusive to a very few amount of people. Upon joining, a old video played, no chat box or anything. We were told a q/a would begin after the live video. Than the q/a section was just a creepy video of a robotic voice somewhat sounding like Kiyosaki repeating incomprehensible senses telling you to buy his $100 course on sale for $10000 that will apparently teach you how to get houses for free. Just a conman.
My sell limit order is in for 15 @ $694.20
Me too! We are friends now.
You sold a leap for a loss after 3 days? I've seen paper hands in my day but damn son.
i am not paperhand, but this ship is not going to moon forever, at some point it will go down a bit (especially if GME exercise their option to sell more stock to shore up cash balance)

&#x200B;

so my question to you is when should i take profit so when the ship go down a bit, i can reinvest by buying more GME share with my profit before it goes up again...
BB tomorrow morning?
Facts
Where is it AH??
If you did a ton in December it might fuck you a bit cause it carries into the following year
ABNB CC
Look at Biden's website he's not republican. His gun polices are literally that of Hitler, no wonder people like me think he cheated. I think it's very possible Trump as well!! Unbiased people who don't look at full picture make me so confused as to how or why they think like that.
Don‚Äôt worry my aapl calls are bleeding too
It might bro it went pretty hard today

Guys, I have a confession:

I shit on PLTR for the past 2 days because I missed an exit on my 52 1/15 $25Cs that I bought for $0.50 that was an easy 200%.

(I actually did sell my shares though to play Affirm last night which ended up being the best choice).

I still have those $25Cs.

If this pump lasts into tomorrow, I'm gonna kiss Cathie
i have paper handed twice this week.  ZM calls and wayfair puts on that spike (altho that one no ragrets cuz it was a weekly).  how can i prevent this lameness

The market is definitely getting scared before inauguration
Thats the best way to start. I didnt even know what to do when it came time to sell or exercise, so starting small helped me learn.. Then I went full retard
I've decided to hold my 1/29s to expiration.. gonna have to find a few extra bucks from somewhere to pay for the shares
This is why I use an abacus to count my tendies. Can‚Äôt trust boomer tech
So much red even vixxx is big fuk red

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs gon be a crash soon. Maybe correction but that‚Äôs it. As long as ppl are just rotating from tech to energy to green to small caps to value, and even to bonds, we good, we‚Äôre just juggling liquidity.

Yesterday included intense short covering, I don't know how much of today included that.

Thank you bro!! Solid info here.
Who‚Äôs really gonna sell? Institutions had to buy after it started trading on the market because there was no ipo, just insiders hold shares
This is the way
Are we finally going to see PLTR moon again tomorrow?
Sell for Pltr these fuckers wants to get in
Please don‚Äôt sell GME to get into PLTR. That is not the way. Take out a pay day loan if you have to!
Lol on GME- noooo
imagine not being in Steel gang rn
nice, I got $85 calls for 1/22 lol
Somewhere in the ursa major constellation
So since we're being very forthcoming about it, are you guys still pumping GME or BB tomorrow? What's next week, Napster? Dunkaroos?
22nd. IV crush is gonna hurt but they're printing
Damnn
BB and PLTR green
Seriously it should just be a coke fueled orgy that is only open 10 pm to 4 am. Stonks would fucking moon.
Guys, Cathie slapped the bears face. I love her. PLTR to the moon. That downgrade from citipaper bank aint coincidence. I THINK NOT.

What a good week for me. I bought GME at .14, I bought more PLTR calls this morning, and moved 1/2 my portfolio into BB calls at $9
you, sir, are a fucking LEGEND.
Lol its the same!  But 2020 dollars if it makes you feel better.
It kills small businesses though. They'd be better off lowering the taxes some more for lower and middle class and raising for ultrarich.
$GOEV just announced a deal with Kia

Sugarbaker. Nuff said.
Dont see it in tos
The meme game on this sub is absolutely fucking unreal. Puts everywhere else to shame. 

I‚Äôm actually gonna make an effort to learn more about the autist-focused investing that goes on around here so I can really appreciate this shit fully.
Cathie picked up more pltr today. This is the new price floor. Fucking load up on leaps now dude. Cathie doesn't fuck around, we are going stratospheric
10/10 meme. Arguably the best episode of GoT, top 3 no brainer.
You'll have 6.5 hours tomorrow to do that
Tomorrow is when Melvin has to cover his short position.
So is GME on the WSB mount Rushmore of plays along with AMD and TSLA
Looking at the old comments of people making fun of him is the best
If I knew a I had to do was commit to not throwing away my calls to start the üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ I would've done that a week ago. My bad man
PLTR up $2 AH
PUTS have been losing Bears plenty quick the last 9 months
They salty they didn't get in on the meme early
Let's make it 30 by eow
The Twitter short wasn‚Äôt a bad play...
Don‚Äôt have losses. Or trade in an IRA.
Fuck article is from Feb 2020.
good man
Why were they so high a few years ago and now back to the 10s?
Well you also broke the rule that says links must have a summary in the body of the post, so take your pick.
Biden is gonna downgrade JPMorgan?
y‚Äôall can play with gme. i will not go near it with a 20 foot pole
I bought in pretty low with ICLN a couple days ago, I could risk selling at a loss and buying even lower but I‚Äôll probably just hold it for the long play.  Fingers crossed for the next few months?
Same but I feel that pre market drop coming too
Mind sharing your strategy with a n00b?
What‚Äôs a binding LOI

wooohoooo hyper inflation here we come!!!!
Can't have peaks without valleys, and vice versa. Hopefully I remember that when I am living on the moon in my Tesla house LOL
Buying the Twitter dip, just fell below 100 day MA which is bought by bulls over and over again.
I own shares too I‚Äôm good just made trash money off my options when I could have been balling if I made them a week longer lol. For APHA and TLRY. Apha seems like the play though since it‚Äôs trading lower than what you‚Äôd expect regarding price to merger value.( not sure the correct term but like how much TLRY you get for APHA).
Yep, I agree... looking back over the years, my biggest investing regrets have always been related to selling, rather than buying or holding too long!
I loved being a barista in a crazy busy shop on a college campus. It was fun for me because the busyness meant the time flew by, and most customers were either students or professors and were kind. It was also not very brain intensive; if I was on bar, I could sort of get into a flow of just making drinks for hours. It was a great counterbalance to studying...
They‚Äôre offering extreme anal now
>ELY

Do you think there is steam left?
Yits been...
Doubling my GME position tomorrow. Reckon there will be a dip or set the market order for open?
Isn‚Äôt that fucked though?
I'm with you - but it pulls back when it pulls back. I had a safety play overnight knowing this speech could go either way. Things are about to get more real soon. Interesting how a speech that was very focused on stimulus didn't stimulate.
hold dude, cathie bought 500,000 shares, she will be adding
Omg Trump IMPEACHED
I bought in early and took out profits. It it's been red on the buy back in but I believe that it's going to succeed.
I got a cool new flair so what more can you ask for
Saw an investing.com article that said chinas stock markets up because of hopes for U.S. stimulus while the stock market here is down lol
Nothing. Its the way theyre discussing it that I found funny. They know model numbers, feature lists, all this stuff most people dont even think of. It sounds like a bunch of people talking about cars.
Before you leave see who makes the auto check out machine. With $15 minimum wage those are going to be every where.

Have you ever tried dabbling with options on futures?

I'd def keep like a mil around to play in the market with, and just dividend reinvest the rest off of SPHD, and draw down a salary of like 800k a year or whatever.
Imagine being this close minded lmao.
$ELY.
Just imagine every thinks big red tomorrow

And it‚Äôs big green I‚Äôm talon to u Amazon
If you have ITM options for tomorrow and the cash to exercise I highly suggest doing so
What'd he say?
Lmfaoo hold you'll regret it next year
Nio pls go up tomorrow
Maybe if you wrote the whole word out instead of ‚Äútomm‚Äù and used some punctuation I‚Äôd understand what you‚Äôre saying.
GameStop/BB shares
Someone explain I'm stupid
If FB wasn't acting like commies I would've pulled the trigger at 245. How long can it realistically go before bouncing?
If I could rip out my FOMO brain cells, and listen to the retards here in WSB, my overpriced (and now worthless) Tesla calls would have bought me a house with gme
Thats why noone gives a fuck about them
gl friend
*Rug has left the chat*
How dare he assume our ages?! The only qualification here is being a retarded non-üåàüêª
Lesson learned, will only buy hot meme stocks of the day like GME,BB,BBBY considering everything else wants to be red
Ford, not GM, but other than that, yes.
Sold my position after earnings bump today.  Sold at +40% I wanted to take profits but given weed isn‚Äôt priority I‚Äôm anticipating pullback and I‚Äôll get back in on a dip
Anyone know why W was mooning today
My 1/15 calls are VERY appreciative of it
I wish I understood any of this lol
GME gang has been so silent. Are y'all scared or what is going on
My price target for it is actually above 100, but that is almost an arm and a leg held up for a year to make double my investment. GME has done that in 1 day.
1/26
$BB this is the way
Congrats. Wish i had thrown a few bucks in. But i really didnt see what all the hype was about. It looks like it really is just a meme short seller squeeze. Crazy.
Price target for 1/22 ? I got some calls today

Ok but I want 31 on Monday
I see the option to trade right on the main dashboard.
Did you'll get the reversal of that unsettled funds not to use in crypto update about 8pm est? Or only few select got it?
I mean literally this tho. If the money is being used to stimulate the economy, it‚Äôs provides a net positive outcome, even if it‚Äôs deficit spending. We owe the money to ourselves, after all.  It‚Äôs not like this is foreign spending that we owe.
true
PLTR $25c 1/15, Take me to tendie town Cathie
Guess my spy calls are worthless tomorrow
Step aside GME holders. The time has come for PLTR holders to be in the spotlight.

Don‚Äôt sell GME for PLTR. PLTR is a longer investment, this could be a one day hype.

$10mil tomorrow brother...
"Let your winners ride" is one of the MOST difficult lessons to learn. It's important too, 'cause this is how you offset your losers in the long-run. Never hit the "sell" button. INSTEAD use loose trailing stops! I know it's really hard when you're holding a 5-bagger or 10-bagger and you want that profit locked in and realized (and liquid again). I get it. So if it's liquidity you REALLY need, then just shave off a little of your position. That should do.
You lack vision. Dream my brother!
Get in on GME now and set a stop loss 20% down just in case.
Big red everything = GME & BB fly on retard strength

We went down like .32 %
Anyone know when the PLTR offering closes
As someone who is new to wallstreet bets and who does not day trade how should I perform my daily routines on here? Like is there an introduction to WSB?

Yea, cuz you‚Äôre thinking the stocks they don‚Äôt think are any good- they buy small positions. Interesting strategy, Cathie...

Oh you bet your ass I‚Äôm hoping in
What do you think he's doing right now?
When did he sell those Jan 15 calls?
275
It's undervalued. Top Golf is one of the many assets it holds. But mostly because it is undervalued. Expect $80-$100 by the end of the year.
Buy the pltr hype
I'm a noob at calls. Can you maybe explain to me what happened, or better yet, how I interpret the photo? Please!
Trump impeached wtfffff
Lmao who were the fucktards that tried to ouster mama Cathy. They're probably the only thing I'd short in this market. In 5 years she will cement her position as GOAT.

Love it yo!!!
right? What an asshole
Fucking hell. I bought a 1/15 26C on Monday for .27 and thought meh $27. Sold at 2.7 on that first $2 pullback yesterday smdh.
Look up CHWY's valuation and then look at WOOF. Minimally WOOF is a 2x from its current spot.
There was a decent survey sequence done some weeks ago, and it amounted to some 5 million shares.
Oh RH fixed the unsettled cash cryptocurrency thing.  Somehow that‚Äôs even more unsettling.
Any way to see BB now?

Hey thanks
This week in particular has been really slow. If you‚Äôre not trading any of the GBP pairs then you‚Äôve pretty much been trading a ranging market.
That could dramatically impact competitive advantage, and thus revenue.
You‚Äôre probably too young to use that app sorry think it‚Äôs 18
But premarket opens before 9. Nothing opens at 9
r/conservative is calling for the death of Twitter. And Facebook. And Amazon. And Reddit. And...
That stock really sucks. So disappointing
Yes please...you know any more on NIO?
Isn't there an update tomorrow?
Kind sir would you consider channelling your big dong chakra to PLTR?

They designed it, they dont actually manufacture it. Thats TSM
hope you saved enough money for some honey mussy
Did you include a lil sprinkle of computer vision to scan the gifs for tickers too though? That‚Äôs where the money‚Äôs at. I‚Äôd definitely be interested to know how well GME and TSLA stack up on that metric.

I don't think reddit is fundamentally different, but I do think it's better. The problems with social media are matters of degree and reddit isn't as bad. In my experience, anyway. Peoplenin subreddits fullnof conspiracy bollocks might find it even worse for them than facebook?

To be more specific: I've had much higher quality conversations on reddit than on facebook and I regularly end up reading academic articles as a reault of my resdit browsing. I think I've only ended up reading a good quality article because of facebook twice agter years of fairly heavy use - with reddit I think it happens weekly.

In fact, most of the academic reading I've done that hasn't been directly related to my thesis has been because of reddit. Obviously I'm limited to only my experience, others will have quite different relationships  with reddit and facebook. In my case reddit is less harmful than facebook by a fair margin :)
Wondering the same. Got some and sold before latest dip. Still monitoring closely.

I don't know man, I thought my positions were safe but now I'm a little worried. I should not have went balls deep in this bitch without protection
If I made 7m on stocks, I'd take 1-2 million and only use that for any future stock market bets, and bank the rest permanently. If I zero out the 1-2 million, no big deal. If I make more, bank a portion and keep going.
Bought a call on BB June 15 strike i think I'm happy

Yeah I think long term AMD will have to adapt to survive. There's a rumor going around that they're already working on an ARM chip to compete with the M1.

$15/hr minimum wage will result in fewer jobs. All that will happen is that a lot of jobs won't get done because they are not worth $15/hr. 

$18/hr seems very low for a software developer, he should look for something else.

Says the guy yoloing money into stocks he doesn‚Äôt understand technicals of. It‚Äôs literally been researched thousands of times.

Gotcha - that would make a lot more sense. When the actual squeeze starts this thing is going to be wild.

That's actually a very good point, it would create distance between the admin if the next election ends up projecting to be close.
I held PLTR 25 puts and sold for a loss literally 5 minutes before it dropped into the 24.xx I had to get the cash back for GME calls though and made 600 off a 55c 1/15 intraday

It‚Äôs only ever been above 30 for a cup of coffee
nah it looks like a number 2 at arby‚Äôs
yup, but life is fucked, so what can you do
Use spreads
Bear?
I would start with getting an app. I use Stockpile, but I think Robinhood is better. And I just invest in anything that I know and what I think will go big. Right now my best are NIO and AMD, but I also like to invest chunks of money into big companies (Amazon, apple, Microsoft, etc) just to earn easy money. The apps make it really easy to see your progress and they are easy to use so just start there, you got it! (I‚Äôm a 17 year old girl and started when I was like 15 so I know exactly where you‚Äôre at!)
I work at a nuke plant and I do not advise this

Question. Do my options remain the same value after hours? I‚Äôm holding an options on a stock that has gone up after hours, but I don‚Äôt see the change in my contract only in the after hours market indicator on the actual stock.

Cost basis was around $3/share, yeah.
It needs to go up for sure, but I'd rather see a phased approach.  Or fix it then tie it to CPI.  Or something a little less brain dead than leaving it to political gridlock so that it doesn't move for 12yrs

In other news, BBBY MOONING TMR üöÄ
And it's technically forum-like, not social media lol
GME headquarters never responds, lol trust me I‚Äôve contacted them twice in the last few years. 

Cramer isn‚Äôt asking to directly let them off....that would be an indirect result, but for GME to fully transition to eCommerce.

RC and Sherman know better than that though. They‚Äôd lose ton of future investors and customers by pulling that kind of move. Plus if I was in their positions, I would enjoy the thought of knowing shady firms are getting screwed and wanted my the company to go bankrupt...

Would be the kind of thoughts I‚Äôd have in my head when I‚Äôm banging my wife so I could finish faster.
Let‚Äôs get Cramer cancelled for going full retard live on air lol

Yo for the past 2 1/2 years I‚Äôve been here I‚Äôve never seen wsb be so fucking right in such a big way so many fucking times in a row
After this last stimulus announcement we will have the stimulus talks going well pumps but then what? Just high unemployment, low interest fights that off, and a high valued market. 

We might get into a boring market. I fucking hope so. Y‚Äôall tards have every fucking theta up so high it‚Äôs hard to make money even when you are right.
What is your trading style?  Which filters you use will depend heavily on that.
I mean I have 17 calls that are now worth $36k but even I feel greedy holding through today. I tried to sell a few today but the buy price never hit.
Thanks, I meant a mutual fund that tracks an index.
Have a 1/2022 130c so less stress. If that doesn‚Äôt hit, we‚Äôve got bigger problems.

True but this is oversold now and earnings beat will make this moon imo
It stays the same it was at close
I'd say this is simply a correction after being suppressed by the shorts; not that it's inflated. Several users here have posted financials to back that claim up.
Does he have an angle for a Xbox X already? WTF I can't find one under $999....
Same question. Received $1217 under first stimulus (based on 2019 income).  Then changed bank accounts due to fraud (thanks wifey).  Didn't receive second stimulus payment like all of us here.  I understand that I might have to claim on my taxes. But my 2020 income was larger, and every calculator I'm seeing shows zero money.

2019 AGI: $193,650

2020 AGI: $199,000 (pending)

Married filing jointly. 2 kids under 17.

I checked my tax transcript but it's not clear. I see the the $1217 first stimulus, but a bunch of weird refund/credit lines around that time.  Then, on Janu 4, 2021, it shows a $217 tax relief.  Was that the payment that my previous bank rejected?  Should I have received that $217 bawd on my 2019 income?  And will I now miss out because my 2020 income is higher?

Please help. Need to know how mad to be at my wife for losing her purse.

Thanks!
Me too, me too.

Futures? You think these idiots can predict the future?
Who knows with the way this market has been. I can see $40-$60 being a reality.

I believe Caitlin may be our only ally in the belly of the beast known as WSJ. Her most recent hits include titles like:

"TikTok and Discord Are the New Wall Street Trading Desks"

VIX üíÄ
You know how you can tell if someone has only been trading since October?

They call it a "rug pull" when the VIX is down...
If this hits $55 tomorrow I might shit my pants.
Same here, although a decade or two earlier.

Excellent job.
I got it off the gate at 27.91, hoping for it to get to chewy price range
45 seems reasonable
The farther OTM an option is, the more money it makes moving closer to ITM.

The closer the expiry, the more money it makes as it moves closer to ITM.

Take profits from a conservative leap that printed early and roll them into a closer expiry or a farther OTM or both. 

Its definitely an increase in risk in exchange for a larger profit %.

Fuck me it worked 

Pltr is up almost 7% AH
It means your first thought would be to read a PR relating to the merger... Depending on what it states, after the dust settles you either get Google shares, cash, or mix of both.

It happens. Most professional funds have rules / guidelines which prevent them from the fund having too much exposure to any one play.
I'm trying again with the stats panel, turns out I was using a flatfile DB instead of postgres. Oops..

It's a shady looking link (not on the domain yet) but [here](http://167.71.245.87:3000/public/dashboard/057d43f1-d677-4d8f-9d49-86a1d8857d3d).

See if you can hug it to death. It's not as good as it was before yet but I'll get all the queries/charts back to normal soon.
$PLTR to the moon (until it crashes again 2 days later, as per usual) .
Yeah I actually did that before I ever bought/sold my first futures contract. I pretty much only traded /ES options and didnt touch oil or anything else. Dont care for them, theta is a bitch. I much rather just trade futures normally and trade options on stocks
Time In the market beats timing the market.
Played ES calls off that bounce
What time is Joe Biden talking?
Maybe your username answers your question
I don't know options. Slightly confuses me personally; I can't make smart decisions heh.
We are pumping both of them into next week my friend.
Can I ask what vehicle you will use to day trade crypto?
Hey thanks
I think some of the people here can answer this. How on Earth did Axios suddenly become a force in journalism. Out of the blue they got HBO deal. Interviewed Trump and have been interviewing high profile players in the Hill. Who are they actually? Their scoops are on par with nyt,wapo.
Do you asswipes think my plays  r fuk? Gme 48c???
He borrowed shares and sold them at $15 (naked short) and promised the borrowers he will give them back their GME shares on 1/15 (tomorrow).

What just happened with PLTR after hours?
Same situation and location. I go to bed 1800-1900 wake up 0030 then do the thing til close which is when the chow hall opens up.
Not DD
I think we found Enron Musk aka Trevor Milton! I thought you weren‚Äôt allowed to post publicly about Nikola anymore.
hmmm interesting. could be the next squeeze üí¶üí¶
Never heard of it. But, I‚Äôm feeling the urge to drop my IQ, so here I go...
I wonder what the next stock pick will be
‚ÄúPeople‚Äù you mean this fucking pump and dump autist sub
Dang... u sound smart
Nice attempt at a pump n dump
future don't matter when  you are 100% in PLTR
100 shares is $900. But 10 contracts at .90 each is 1000 shares for $900. So much more profit/loss potential for the same price for those who are lower on capital

RH is pushing Cr**to hard. I‚Äôd be interested to see they‚Äôre monetizing those trades.
He seems to imply that WSB planned this short squeeze. Is the true? I mean, I know people have been talking about GME for months but I haven‚Äôt heard anything about a short squeeze. Just DD about new management and shit like that.
sometimes people just get lucky
I hope it never changes. Eventually it will get pussified and Reddit will start censoring us and bringing in more and more faggitry.
I not only miss them but catch everything right before they drop. Even if it‚Äôs down 10% and i go in... it manages to go lower.
Possibly it more likely it should go up since it‚Äôs down big
I doubt he will live much longer if his short position keeps getting bum rushed.
Thanks!

Okay, I've been on this sub long enough. After I've made gains on GME.

I will NOT lose everything on the next meme stock.

Then I WILL buy the following trend.

Options prices only update during regular market hours.

645 PH of S19‚Äôs at 4¬¢ power is about $180k a day after expenses. That‚Äôs  $5.4m a month. With a market cap of $500m that‚Äôs 100 months or about _8 years_ of mining. BUT network hashrate will increase within about 3 months. Within 6 months these will barely be profitable.

Please be careful with miners. It‚Äôs a commodity business and their margins collapse to 0 very quickly.

OZSC is going to be a big deal and I'm long on it. 

**Ozop Energy Solutions** invents, designs, develops, manufactures, and distributes ultra-high power chargers, inverters, and power supplies for a wide variety of applications. OZSC serves as a provider of assets and infrastructure needed for **clean energy.**

OZSC is aiming to be a **global leader of supply chain solutions within the renewable energy market** as its consumers are using more watts than ever before.

**On June 29, 2020**, OZSC acquired Power Conversion Technologies (PCTI) and changed its name from Ozop Surgical Corp to Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc. in order to reflect the pivot and strategic change from innovative surgical technologies to enter the **exploding energy storage market.**

For the past 29 years, PCTI, or Power Conversion Technologies, has specialized in power semiconductor analysis and application, digital signal processor control, and thermal exchange ‚Äì **necessary innovations for the renewable energy market.**

**On January 7, 2021**, Ozop announced the formation of a new subsidiary, **Ozop Energy Systems, Inc**. Ozop Energy Systems will address customer project demand streams through **an online catalogue portal (****ozopenergy.com****)** or directly with procurement specialists by working with suppliers around the world. The website is under construction, but they will be launching it in the coming months to host WESCO's supplier's products (see below).

Whether it be an EV station or an entire municipal storage grid, **Ozop will be a key resource of top-quality products** via the network of premier manufacturing partners.

**On January 12, 2021**, Ozop announced a **Master Supply Agreement with WESCO International**, Inc. (NYSE: WCC), a Fortune 500 (379) company generating $8.4 billion in 2019 with **30,000 suppliers and 70,000 customers** worldwide. This agreement allows Ozop, via Ozop Energy Systems, to access premier manufacturers as a key source of top-quality products and solutions. Over the past few months, WESCO has **compiled their renewable manufacturers and all of the products they sell into one catalogue for Ozop to sell via the online portal.**

Customers (more detail at **pcti.com/pcti-customers**):

o **US Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines**: Converters, Battery Chargers, Power Supply, Inverters, Circuitry

o **Eaton, Exelon, Georgia Power, Mitsubishi**: Circuit Breaker Testing Equipment

o **Ford, Caterpillar**: Overhead Cranes

o **General Motors**: Coating Systems

o **NASA**: Ground Power for Space Shuttle Payloads

Good luck everyone, and don't forget: DIAMOND HANDS!

Well, the premium may have rose more, but let‚Äôs look at the break evens. Break even for the $10C is $11.68, break even for the $15 is $15.98

Assuming it goes to $30 by expiry, the $10C makes more profit [profit = (stock price - break even) * 100] so it‚Äôs better to buy the $10C over the $15C

I'm up on C-o, hopped off tesla and poured it in a month ago, caught the weeks wave and made a couple tendies
I wouldn't really try to diversify 5k.  I would focus on one company till you have about 100 shares of it and then buy a second company and try to get 100 shares of it. Of course if it's at good value. Companies like o will be around while you accumulate 100 shares of it.
Ur good

They are going into EV market and contract with Sonu.. perhaps.  So yeah, lots of new business strategy
You‚Äôre able to hold past 1/15..? Or assuming $60 tomorrow

GME
More GME today at open then see how it plays out. Nobody knows how high it will spike today (some bulls are estimating somewhere between 80-100 if enough hands remain diamond) but be ready to take profits.

If there are huge amounts of highly OTM calls which expire tomorrow, doesn't it make more sense for MMs to pin the price down (say below 40) to make sure all of these calls expire worthless?

Seeing this move and dd predictions playing out, the gambling side of me came out and I‚Äôm convinced this is headed to the moon. My csp‚Äôs i sold where deep ITM. $44 and $46 expiring tomorrow. I wish I knew how to see what the current short interest is as of today not 12/31. If it is still what people are are saying, I can‚Äôt even imagine how high this can go. If it goes south sooner than later, at least i had the cc i sold. Right now, im looking at it as insurance. If I closed it now and locked in the loss, id be 100% long.

Yes, way before
Wake up in the morning and consider never posting here ever again.
yeah us. But the 40 strike shouldn't count because it was there before. But we probably did buy 500 000 000$ of calls if we look at all the expiries and not today. We're double counting some as well because people bought and sold on the same day in some instances. 

But yes, its an astounding number of calls purchased in one day.

You‚Äôre not much of a fool tbh. This is one of the most benign ways to fuck up with options. You went long and guessed wrong so you lost your investment, or most of it.

I understand and respect your need for more information on a plan, those details are out there. This DD is a simple example of the big picture. Ryan Cohen, of Chewy fame, laid out a plan to the board at GME. He then acquired even more shares, to make sure he and his team would secure seats on the board to implement the plan. The short squeeze along with the turnaround plan are what jumped GME from $20 to $40 in 2 days. Take a look at the guy who had conviction around this plan from over a year ago. Read some of his old DD for reference. Michael Burry was also in early on GME.

This is a stock with a market cap of 83MM that just took a loan for 140MM to survive. Just curious why else do you think it's a good trade? Or is this just pure speculative play?

I jus want to say I‚Äôve been following this stock closely since the beginning of December and am in for 20,000 shares. There is going to be consistent news coming out as they release new numbers and their testing capacity grows. I‚Äôve sat in on their investor meetings and if I remember correctly they only need to do 5 tests a day to break even on a test site and they are averaging 70+ tests a day per site. They are also pivoting to be a big player in vaccine rollout and the government is practically going to write a blank check to get that done here soon. On top of all this they only have a fraction of the total sites completed and are getting better and better at rolling them out.

Again I‚Äôve been following this since December and the volume has been consistently low. There isn‚Äôt many eyes on it right now and I can only see it going up in the near term especially as more people hear about it and see the numbers. On that note, they‚Äôve officially completed their name change and are putting out updates via email and Twitter under the new name.

I‚Äôve thrown half my portfolio at this stock. Do your own DD and make the decision for yourself but out of all the positions I‚Äôm in right now this is the least risky and, to me, nearly guaranteed to go up once more eyes are on it.
Yeah, ok.  Go look at the last several times GME spiked.  Notice a pattern?

Little late but wow gme ah
If you are in doubt, don‚Äôt fully commit. If you are for example planning on investing 5K in it. Start with 1500 or 2000, and keep some some ammo for when it comes down. If it doesn‚Äôt come down, you are making profit.
You can still decide to buy more at a higher price, or wait for a dip, or just invest in something else.
Not to mention the S&P500 still has very high PE ratios compared to the historical average, which increases the risk of buying in now compared to other times.

one other tip. don't spend money. live like a student as long as you can. I'm several decades into life now and I still live like a student. It makes more of a difference than anything you invest in.

Bought BBBY.  Rock, paper, scissors....
> I'd still have the actual stocks that I could wait out for it to go back up if it ever does.

Since this fund sells covered calls, I wouldn't bet on it coming back up quickly after a possible crash. 

>If it lasts 12 years without tanking

Highly unlikely. On average market tanks every 2-3 years.
Interesting article. Thank you
Eh
What if Ure back in time and u still manage to miss it
Fuck me i sold them already
I bought the same back in December
Basically if the price moons you‚Äôre good if it stays flat or dips you will see compounding losses

Eh
I'm an economist, I fully understand the mechanisms of monetary and fiscal policy.

I am not against stimulus, but there are better ways of going about it. A wage subsidy, for one, reduces the burden on government, and allows employers and employees to better adapt to changing conditions.

A stimulus, that, for lack of a better term, throws money at problems and has political strings attached will solve problems in the short term, but will cause long term pains that may be worse. 

And I don't know why you believe that we were headed for a depression, that's blatantly false.

I'd be happy to explain to you if you want in more detail.
People are mad sleeping on the rotation out of tech
Let‚Äôs pool our money, buy the Brooklyn Nets, move their arena to wall street to play on the exchange floor, and rename them WallStreet Bets. Raining 3s from tendie town.

Agreed if your just throwing shit at the wall to what sticks it should be like 20% or less of your $$ IMO
I made the mistake of buying weeklies this week, then buying more weeklies to cover my loss, failing to sell when the recovery calls had 90$ profit, then bought a put as it tumbled, sold that early for 20$ profit just to find out that put would‚Äôve been worth 300.

T mobile has been doing really well, so there wasn‚Äôt really a reason for the drop other than the shitty week most stocks had. It‚Äôs been above 130 for the past month, dropped to 125 today. It has to recover tomorrow... right? I need my tendies üòÇ

I have some monthlies for them though that should succeed. Just gotta makeup for 200$ in stupid choices üòÇ
since when did puts need to be covered unless of they wrote puts?
.0003 to .01 since September, huge run already. Not a huge fan of the share structure but I‚Äôll add it to the watch list. Thanks for your time, sir.
Technical could belong in ARKK as a disruptor
Not stopping until we get the coke/expensive hookers/yachts
I hear people say the market is completely unhinged, I'm not sure I buy that.

Sure, there is Tesla and the EV market. And then there is GME.

But those are a loud minority. GME isn't even really unexplainable. The short sellers overdid it and now they are screwed. 

The rest of the market, particularly the tech side, is backed up by great earnings.
Sweet. I only made a few hundred.  I bought up a few shares based off a random dd post a few weeks ago. And of course now I am suffering from the classic I regret not buying more feeling. What price did you get in at?
Hang on. This youtube guy is deepfuckingvalue?
Here we go again...there‚Äôs always one lurking around...mooning to death
There's sell to close and sell to open, if I'm not mistaken, if you sell to close you sell the contract you bought at market rate and sell to open means you are writing a brand new contract someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

For some that is a lot. Tadpoles my boy. Happy tadpoles. Like me! I just don‚Äôt post.
Shares are both safer & make it more likely that it will go up.  If we‚Äôre right, then you should be looking at a 50% (or more upside), so why bother with timing it with options (the IV is crazy pricey right now)

Yup. Similar to NVDA, I bought AMD calls when it was trading at $9 when it was a total sleeper. Sold when the stock was at $40. In hindsight I should have rolled them.
Holy shit PLTR let‚Äôs goooo!
Research like their plans to close 1000 stores by April, or what research you talkin bout, bruh?
What a fuck‚Äôn tardass.
Yeah friend, get rid of those emotions. Just play with 5% of your money so you don‚Äôt feel like you missed out while still scratching that gambling itch.

Ayo question. If you buy a leap and nearing expiration, it‚Äôs otm. What‚Äôs your play from there?

Would you sell the calls? How much of a percent loss are you looking at with that?

And if you can‚Äôt find someone to sell to, does that mean you just exercise the option and buy at market price and take the L?
Heavy feeling of rotation out of tech and into clean energy tomorrow, or a sell off.

go get Yahoo's finance app, you can use it to scout companies. it'll show you the price of the company over time, how much dividend they will pay you to own the stock per year (yield), how much they make in revenue and profits, and a lot of other stuff. it can tell you if a company is a winner, in good health.

there are, like, hundreds of good plays at any moment! if you want to win, start by not losing; the economy just creates new value constantly, we can farm it by owning low-risk securities that pay. best is if you can get it for cheaper than it really ought to be, like when everybody panics for whatever reason. be brave in those times.

Your statement has been made previously. There's always some fundamental reason to back up why it's apparently different this time.

But, for some reason, it never is.
Is this the bottom or is it gonna bottom again that tends to happen when I go in
Apple, Amazon, or Google. Personally I'd day Apple or Google.
Some of both but mostly naked options and spreads. I've been considering more lately to start selling covered calls on $TSLA though.

Your thought process is in the right place, which is why I got out of APHRA now and got into TLRY before it (hopefully) takes off around the merger. 

Fun fact, I bought TLRY at IPO during that wild first month where it peaked at like $150. Ended up selling all my shares at $40 and never thought I‚Äôd be buying back in

Lol completely understand, I'm in the same boat. I was lucky enough to get in below 19 though, so its fluctuations and overall sideways trading since Thanksgiving hasn't been bugging me much. 

Unsolicited advice: Keep a separate tracker of your holdings. Mark all the ones you're currently "long term" on. Make a rule for yourself: anything long-term, you have to hold it until at least two weeks after next earnings report, unless major news drops that causes material changes to your outlook (like what has been happening with BABA since November). 

All definitions of owning a stock/ETF "long-term" had better include waiting long enough for the next quarterly earnings. This will dramatically reduce your angst levels. 

Example: I'm heavy on AMD. It has dropped 10% in the last week. My target share price is 150-175, sometime between April and June of 2022. The last week hasn't changed this for me, so I give exactly 0.0 fucks about what has happened the last week. Intel's good news today did nothing to change my mind about AMD.
Incredible lol
I will be honest, I was drunk and I don‚Äôt know why I thought I found the next gold mine. I did absolutely no DD and sold all my shares and went in. So yeah hopefully just waiting for the next catalyst to roll back into ARK shares and monthlies.

All jobs have some 'job' aspects to them. That isn't necessarily bad, imo. I feel that a bit of struggle can be good for your soul. You just have to pick and choose where you spend your time. Also, having the freedom to leave is mentally powerful.

Just... finding the shit you wanna do. You like woodworking? Start making chairs (or some shit like that). You are going to have to deal with customers and there will be a sales aspect to it, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

I don't have any videos, but I'm considering starting a youtube channel. I'm a full time trader, investor and asset manager so I have time to do so.
If the price moons AND you are ITM right? If you have a 45c and the price is 46 and you hold til close, you can make a profit of 100 (plus a tiny tiny premium) less the premium you paid? If you have 55c it is probably best to sell early to avoid theta decay?
We'll be sure to send u a postcard from mars
How do you stay updated on what Cathie buys?
Dawg wtf are you on about lmao
God dammit, I‚Äôm in.

Congrats, fuck you, and you belong here
It‚Äôs called priced in.
Unironically buying more GME, X and Vale
We‚Äôre still on the Trump pumps.
I didn‚Äôt know this was r/suburbproblems
It's a little risky to buy over $1.20 IMO. Massive support currently at $1. Should be a decent swing and a nice medium/long hold too though. Legislation gonna be on the president's desk soon which provides funding for domestic uranium.

WSB is just a 21st century symptom of an age old issue. As long as there are markets there will be irrational exuberance, bubbles, downturns, etc. It's not a WSB problem, it's a problem with unrestrained capitalism.

I'm not advocating one way or another, it's just reality. The big boys might try to blame the next collapse on WSB, Tesla or what have you, but this is the game.
I can‚Äôt decide if he likes us, hates us, or is simply entertained by us.
Feel like it‚Äôs to late now but idk for GME
Then they would buy back the puts with cash not stocks...
They‚Äôre trying so hard to cope. It‚Äôs so funny
Whoops I figured it out am retarded
Been holding shares since mid September dip. Will likely sell around earnings

Can you just ban him. Account has no activity prior to yesterday, all posts in the entire history are pump for this and he's posted this same thread multiple times. This level of desperation to share advice is more indicative of a PnD attempt
But when is it hitting 100?
Mostly let it expire worthless

THANKS A LOT TSLA $1050c 1/15
> quality/stable dividend stocks are a good alternative to bonds yielding almost nothing

Absolutely and unequivocally false. The reason why bonds are a good hedge to growth stocks is because they have a negative correlation. Dividend stocks have less returns and are still positively correlated. That is a garbage hedge.
The problem with RH and WB is that they don't trade OTCs, which why I was asking about traditional stock brokers
Dude. Dont give up. Im a year younger than you, but instead of busting my balls with a degree, i put that effort working my way up the banking ladder with my high-school diploma.

Just put in the work, solid work. Its rough, but you will be noticed. I didn't apply to be where i am, i was picked because they needed someone like me.

Remind me in 3-4 years. 100% you'll be in a better place.
Supply and demand
Dope, can't wait to sell at open. I figured my $255c were dead
Why's does not?
So my 1/15 $42c might print? That would blow my mind if that happens.
Anybody else getting overly suspicious about how well they've been doing lately?
did Biden say anything that would cause the market to selloff tomorrow?
Cathie is like Elon but of stocks. She announces ARKX and SPCE & MAXR take off.

I was an IC for 25+ years.  If I even went back into tech I think I would lie on my resume and say that I've come over from a different career:  history, sociology, photography.  That way I would be able to just be a junior position and not give a fuck about advancement nor extra responsibilities.
I bought at 90

Yeah I gambled biggly on a big jump tomorrow.  Looks like no dice, going green by open

>hydrogen 

Let me stop you right there. Hydrogen as an energy medium is doomed to fail. Compared to lithium batteries, hydrogen has a lower energy density and is vastly more difficult to produce and transport. 

Moreover, it doesn't even provide any discernable advantages over lithium batteries. Elon Musk even called hydrogen cars a "dumb idea".

Any calls to get in on?
What this commotion about BB (blackberry)?
Hope people bought the dip. This is just going to go higher with an even bigger stimulus coming
Too many players. One guy YOLOing it here actually owns 0.2% of the company and will cause a small drop the instant he pushes sell.
Which ark?
Weed stonks boutta be as high as the millennials trading em
If everyone who asked about it would buy, the short squeeze would be properly squoze again. Let me know where you guys stand with it.
Such a sour hour for x today.
lol. i prefer lead flavor
Dang, 1k from a call here.
I sold for 35k if you look at my comment history I posted the screenshot like 50 times
Lol, and this is what people were saying to deepfuckingvalue when he was buying calls.

Yeah, the guy buying GME at over 50% of what it was 5 fuckin years ago is the genius lol.
Dude look at it this way. You did public service for the WSB retards so that they can make tendies in their PLTR bags.
Party like its 2006.

I don't know why more people aren't in that one.
Gotcha.  It is definitely different, and the community is absolutely more respectable and fact driven driven for sure.  That's why I use it, I just feel like the staff are attempting to monetize it in the same way other platforms do as well, they are just more careful about how, which makes me feel.like it's the same, if you follow.  Depending on how you look at it, could be better or worse.  I am of the opinion that all social media is ultimately bad for your brain, esp for people like me who deal with severe anxiety, which makes them all look the same from my chair.  I read magazines or books like medical journals or the economist to get my academic reading in, still a better source for me since I don't have to wade through the same garbage articles about politics to get there, that and the lack of comments allow me to draw my own conclusions.  Maybe I should curate my feed some, but doing that is just like adjusting your fb feed and ultimately narrowing your view.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Win some lose some I guess.

Lol there isn‚Äôt one. A situation like GameStop‚Äôs is a once in a lifetime type deal.
As if a boomer can understand what the fuck is going on in here
We‚Äôre rich bitch!!!!!
The key is the volume. A WSB (redditor) can come in and buy 100s of shares if they wanted to, but the short sellers eventually need to buy 3 times more shares than are available to be sold (allegedly).
Man ... u/deepfuckingvalue is receiving so many mentions he could basically dictates the next short. Fuck 2% of GME, he might make 2% of anything at this point.
E-commerce for nerd stuff
I sold 29c‚Äôs for tomorrow and even I‚Äôm scared. I bet it goes retard like SPCE

I like that PLTR AH action. Holding may 17.5c and jan 2022 25c and shares.
I'm hoping for a correction and for it to hold sub $45 for the next week so my covered calls don't get exercised next week lmao
I might go in on this.  The thing is streaming alone won't replace the money a single marvel movie can make.  Endgame by itself made 2.7B.  That is one movie making 2.7B.  I just don't see people letting that slip away.  No streaming service is making 2.7B more worth of subscriptions revenue cause of 1 movie coming out.

what does it mean that the $43 call has 0 open interest?
Computers aren‚Äôt just for sharing memes, we can also use them to do things that would otherwise take us too long. 

The results would be biased with the bull market, a strong pullback could also result in negative return memes. Only way to know how reliable it would be is to implement it.
I looked around and found someone so much smarter than me lol. They said this:

With the volume of puts sold, whoever sold them needs to hedge (basically insure their loss incase they expire deep in the money), they do this by opening a tonne of short positions, when the puts expire worthless these short positions get closed by buying back shares they sold short.

You are absolutely right. They see trump as a liability. This is a strategic pivot away from him. He‚Äôs made them a lot of money but his usefulness is waning. They‚Äôve calculated it‚Äôs better to cut bait now, coincidentally at the end of his term üòâ. I guess seditionist using your platform will do that. 

Tangentially related, I wish we‚Äôd all stop pretending corporations care about anything other than money. They only exist to make money. I don‚Äôt care how much of a good game they talk, it‚Äôs just marketing. They don‚Äôt care about you, why would they? We shouldn‚Äôt care about them. Them giving money to charity is nice and all but I‚Äôd rather them pay more in taxes so we don‚Äôt need their charity.

Closing stores is bullish. It's cutting costs and non profitable cash burns.

They're paying off debt faster than anyone anticipated.

They have a deal with MSFT for a cut of ALL digital game sales in the Xbox store.

They've expanded to all and everything gaming. Need a phone case controller? GME. Need a new mobo or GPU? GME.

50 million power up rewards members is consumer access that literally cannot be bought anywhere else.

Ever heard of Chewy?

There's piles of research on why GME is bullish.

Mfs will trade tesla and nio to the fucking moon when they're already valued at 1000x earnings.

Cramer pumping the bbby post holy crap
Ok bois, ill admit im actually a boomer and ive been buying stocks all this time and have no clue how options work.

With options, is your liability only limited with your positions?

For example if i buy a SPY 400c expiring next week or whenever and it doesnt hit that price and stays at the current price, does my option expire worthless?

What if the current price is 380, and it tanks to 360, what happens to my position?

Thanks and i know im gay and retarded.

I'm just glad I decided on funding a much larger amount on BNGO than JAGX so for once it's worked out yay üôÇ
PLTR will go to the üåö. But do you remember in Men in Black where those aliens were playing with marbles and each marble was its own galaxy? GME will leave the Milky Way marble, shoot through the head of the alien, and go to the üåö in whatever fucked up supra galaxy they play marbles in.
Lmao maybe
E*Trade is the one I would prefer.
Google ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù
Yes. Or if you must "prove" it to yourself, study up as much as you can and open a very small account with money you can afford to lose. Day trade one share at a time and then assess your results. As others have said, you'll see how hard it is to be consistently profitable. And you'll feel much worse if you put up all your capital right away and quickly lose it.  I wish you and your family well.

Congrats on not giving up! That's the key. Losing money is not a reason to give up. Not understanding why you lost money is. I've spent my whole adult life constantly learning (a lot of the time by making mistakes). A lot of good advice to heed re index funds. I would say it is also wise to do at least some stock picking if you have enough to build a mini divirsified portfolio. It will teach you a lot about yourself (patience, greed, fear, ego). The most important thing is to be honest with yourself: did you make a killing because you were smart or because you were lucky? Even the most seasoned investors struggle with this. Good Luck in 2021!
yeah but it was upgraded by cathie and wsb so ...

Bro you are trying so hard to pump sunny D it‚Äôs pathetic.
In the scheme of things, no.  He did say everyone pays fair share of taxes.  Top 50 companies can't pay no federal tax.  It's fine.  Trickle up will more than make up for what those companies pay in taxes.

Usually for promotions like that, the bank account has to stay active/open for a certain duration in order to 'keep' the signup bonus. I personally like Capital One. I have a couple of checking, savings and credit cards with them. I haven't had any issues.

The banks just look for the deposit and there's no minimum balance required. I would read the fine print like the other comment said.
how is that possible

Hi big dummy here, if I buy $3 call options expiring in 2022 for BP (Currently trading at 25.63) for 22.43 a call. 

Assume BP stays at 25.63 tomorrow at open, is that a free 20 cents a call? 

So if I put 10k down on puts, I‚Äôd make 2k easy?
Hold tight brother and keep your head back because it‚Äôs gonna rocket very quick
Gme retards would be more tolerable if there wasn't 500 questions about a squeeze, ridiculous pt, and talking about melvin
If you sold the stock at a loss and did not buy back you could hold the loss. 
You could also buy into a similar company. For example sell one airline company and buy another one so you can take a loss but overall maintain the same position.

It really pisses me off that people spend so much time talking about ICLN in this thread.

Go buy it, by all means.  I dont care.  It's a nice ETF and I put it in my daughter's custodial account.

But fuck man, this is WSB and you're fixated on your precious little ETF.
Not biting
First, have your parents open an account as you cannot legally invest yet. Then start research, try to find an app with 0 fees/commission in your region.

Can a few of you guys give me a couple pointers on how to buy calls for BB when trading opens? Not sure how much higher strike price should be and what expiration date to pick.

If Delta or Theta are saying 0.000 is this a bad thing?

I had a bride who told be during the initial consultation that she didn't really want a photographer, but her friends told he she needed one.   The groom got drunk before the wedding and passed out before the first dance.  Eventually came down for the cutting of the cake, yet was still totally sloshed that the mic was taken away from him.  Oh yea, they also paid for extra time after the reception.  Worst Wedding Ever!

I've always had a BB phone and still use my Blackberry Priv phone, it's been 5 years now but just this week I cracked the screen and will have to get a new phone, but guess what? BB is coming out with a new phone Q1 (they're not making it, just licenses the name to another company to make, but i dont care, keyboard!) and I will be buying it! If this isn't a sign that BB is going to üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ then I don't know what is.
This explains why pltr is up 5% afterhours. Fucking inverse world here. Announced contract. Down 4. Announce shit news. Up 5. Yup.
Make sure it‚Äôs a limit order like 50% above the close price of the option
I‚Äôm putting a huge chunk of my paycheck tomorrow straight into GME shares at open. No toilet paper hands here
Holy shit she's gunna make me come
If you can‚Äôt afford to exercise it expires worthless and you only lose what you pay for it. If it‚Äôs far OTM and nearing expiration you might be down 99.99% with no buyers anyway.  Watch some YouTube vids guy.
The next big short squeeze is üéõ‚òÄÔ∏è cannabis stock.

This is fascinating.

Not sure. I‚Äôm new to all this. The 2k was a stupid idea of throwing my paycheck in for a quick short return. Just want to get my best utilization.

GME Trail Stop Zerg Blitz Theory

Several posts have recommended against using a stop on GME because it can be seen on L2 and used for stop hunting.  However, if thousands of small investors all use trail stops of different amounts, does the data become too difficult to manage and track for stop hunters?  If the trailstop was around 10 points, but something randomly chosen like $10.03 or $10.07, would that be too hard for algorithms to stop hunt?   

The end game of the GME squeeze could be in the next week.  More and more people will use stops, but I thought this theory could help more people stay in the squeeze without taking profits too early.  Is it a terrible idea?
I truly believe Cathie loves us.

BB is gonna print
The value of the option goes down if the price of the stock goes down. And if it doesn't hit the price target yes it expires worthless.
Why wouldn‚Äôt an institution see this and buy up the remaining shares to further induce squeeze?
Are my 27 1/15 and 28 1/22 gonna print??

All credit to DFV for this amazing play but I think we have to give some credit to the person who started investigating that short list. Seems like the MM was playing games until that started to come to light and Cramer put it on spotlight.

fast food chains are automating the whole procedure of ordering anyway (McD, Burger King etc.), not only because of $$ savings but also cause its faster and probably encourages a lot of upselling (u buy more products at a terminal, I suppose). minimum wage is not the driving factor here I suppose
I bought and sold Tesla over and over last year. Had I just held onto it for a year my profits would've been 4x and I would've paid half as much in taxes. So hold onto for the long term.

Yes, 100%
1mw of nuclear costs as much as 6mw of renewables. 

And nuclear gets more expensive over time. Renewables get cheaper. 

It‚Äôs more cost effective to bulldoze already-paid off nuclear plants and take out a loan to build renewables there. 

Even if you could afford to build a lot of nuclear plants - it typically takes 10-15 years to go from planning to operation. We don‚Äôt have time to wait, need clean energy now.

Oh shit actually in this case cathie wood bought it
I‚Äôm just gonna let you guys know now, I‚Äôm buying GME and BB in the morning so you may wanna buy puts
I don't think that this will pass because of the raise of minimum wage to $15 federally across the country in such a short time. I don't think even if it did pass that the country could manage to switch to that in such a short time period of time. If this does pass the money would be nice we've all experienced tough times, though just because the minimum wage goes up doesn't mean that the price of daily living won't go up. Everything will go up, that's what the majority of people now days do not realize. That stimulus would be great though, I won't say no to another stimulus!

I‚Äôm not the most read on space and cyber as it comes to these companies, but I do know Lock Mart appears to have the 5th generation aircraft market cornered, now if we‚Äôre thinking decades long then it‚Äôs very grey because LMT has the experience and is familiar to the defense industry when it comes to a good production line.

The F-22 is still unmatched and one of the reasons they chose it over the F-23 was that they were better at marketing it. Now the AF, Navy, and USMC may be concerned about future contracts due to some of the hick ups in the F-35 program, but they still got an amazing plane out of it in the end.

Now interestingly enough, both companies have unveiled interesting 6th Gen fighter concepts that look relatively similar. Now it doesn‚Äôt appear that Northrop is working with Douglas again (which has been rather rather poor in the past decade if I recall correctly) which will help improve their chances, however I don‚Äôt see NOC beating out the more experienced and trusted LMT.

Now there‚Äôs also the drone market which as stated by the AF and the Navy for their own versions of the F-A/XX programs will likely be used alongside them.

NOC has the benefit of having built up trust with the Global Hawk and the Triton, however it has not come out with any new stealth designs or put them into use. LMT has come out with the RQ-170 and has used it with the AF and CIA. That being said we lost one of those drones to Iran and only around 20 have been built.

In the end, I would say that LMT due to a successful fifth generation program, more successful stealth drone program, and a few other factors is more likely to be the better option in the long term.

Prob can put in $500 without shitting bricks. Why is it even going up?
You get to pop it‚Äôs cherry.
I think you‚Äôre just identifying the difference between options that trade against an equity underlying and those that trade against futures. VIX options are cash settled and since the underlying can‚Äôt be replicated, they have a term structure that essentially tracks the futures. 

Calendar spreads on equity options allow you to bet on the IV expanding or contracting because the IV at different expirations is strongly linked. There is still some term structure, but not nearly what you see in options based on futures products.
I use a calculator with a checkbox that lets you turn it on and off. I assume it will only be 70% in the case I include it.
I'm at 380 at $28.80. I bought at the peak haha. Oh well, they're shares. Just hold long.

Calls on an ETF
Thanks for putting in the time and effort to write this strat and share with everyone.  Wish we had more posts like this. I gained more from this thread than everything posted here in the past three months.  But I guess people keep their strategy guarded like kfc's secret ingredients.
By "challenge" I was really intending to say a level of market share where Nvidia would definitely feel it. And I can't imagine a scenario where AMD takes even 10% of that market by 4 years from now because the software ecosystem maturity just is not there and that's the slowest part of the whole process.
I spent $100k on NIO options this week. I wish I was only down 2.5%. Stay strong, pal.
Damn how did you guys know
I think ANUS is about to moon.

WHAT ABOUT PLTR!!!???

Buy em all
This is the right way
End of year.  Rather than thinking it as investing in GameStop, think of it as a gamble on Ryan Cohen. The fundamentals look solid and Cohen has a proven track record.
I think she saved mine for tomorrow too!
I'm really trying to minimize taxes, but yeah I've considered that option.
He sold the 1/15 per his last update.

And yes, but he has like $2.2 million now.  So if he had 2000 contracts to buy at $10, he could do just that.
>TSLA is beating SPY in daily volume basically every day now and in the past 30 days Tesla has seen about $1.1T in trading, about double SPY's and about as much as the stock traded in 2018 & 2019 combined.

Even if we wanted to increase minimum wage, a time when small businesses are in their worst position since the Great Depression isn't the time, and it should not be so suddenly massive a rise, more gradual.

Let's see if the 1/22/22 15c prints too!
Will i be liable for recouping the loss? I.e. it goes below the call price i bought it in for?

Or it will literally just expire worthless. What if nothing happens? I.e. the options stays at the price i bought it in?
497,100?
Cherry picked but fine, dude.

Ryan Cohen took over Chewy when it was failing, made it an Amazon competitor. Oh wait, he won actually, then sold to PetCo for 3.3 billion dollars.

He installed himself on the board after buying almost 15% of the company.

But sure, you're smarter than him, know more, and clearly took the time to research. Me and my DOUBLED IN 2 DAYS retirement account will fuck right off.

Just bought 50 shares this afternoon, didn‚Äôt even know blackberry was a still a company this morning.  Came on this board and saw one of my fav memes regarding BB.

Bought it solely on the meme.
Nope, VTSAX is a mutual fund. AFAIK you generally can't trade mutual funds across borders.

OP's friend could instead buy the ETF equivalent (eg. VTI) or find a similar index fund that's offered in their country with a low MER.

Dad plz it's me. I need trading money.
I started investing in around early 2008.  When stuff started to tank in what became known as the financial crisis I doubled down hard on a lot of financials and banks.  Ended up losing around 50 or 60% of my capital.  

I‚Äôve done very well since, but I feel there is more risk to the downside than upside so have been increasing my cash and positioning my portfolio more conservatively.
someone earlier said 250

how icln go up ah but not plug WHY
Yeah that‚Äôs where he gets the idea to steal liposuction waste to make soap.
I sold a $25C and $35C for 1/15 last week as the stock price drifted down to $17‚Äôs. The calls were worth pennies per share at that point. I missed out on an additional $2K in gains. I was also a dumbass and sold a $23CC on 100 of my 150 shares. My price per share $20.16. I missed another $2000 in gains in those 100 shares. I did make a handsome profit on my 50 shares I sold. I‚Äôve had to calm down and realize hindsight is 20/20, I could have had the opposite and just sold everything for a loss. Glad I didn‚Äôt!
Accidentally just called my wife‚Äôs cousin a pussy for investing in VOO and idk how to turn it around.

I‚Äôll be respectful but I‚Äôm not thanking any god for their blessings
Yes so anything you sell in less than 12 months you get taxed at your income tax bracket level. So it could be 20-35%+ depending of course on how much money you are making that year. So options positions that are sold within the year will be taxed like that. 

&#x200B;

Long term holds wont be taxed until you sell them. For me, I dont want to sell until more than 12 months at least so it qualifies as a capital gains tax, which is 15% currently. Although the current administration might raise that. If you dont sell you dont pay taxes.
A WSB ETF should be GME, PLTR, BB, and TSLA
Yeah, I agree.  I don't have any plans to sell.
Sir, this is amazing! I can see it now WSB on broadway. Fantastic job, I love it!
Sell, take my sweet tendies and buy the shares direct.
pray to stonk gods it stays around the teens in the morning
NEE always has been one of my top holdings. Only boomer shares though, no options. Fantastic company and has been the top performing stock in its industry for years.

I have 2 rentals making about $800/mo after PITI each.


When these tenants are out, I‚Äôm going to hire a PM for my next set of tenants.


It was important to learn how to do it, but every time something goes wrong it‚Äôs when I‚Äôm on vacation. Worth the $100/mo.



When it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs good, 3-4 months without lifting a finger. When it‚Äôs bad, it sucks. It‚Äôs 40hrs of labor around my job, trying to make a drive to the property and meet a contractor on my lunch, etc.


Worth the $1200/year/rental to have the 40hrs back if even one issue happens.



I had 1 big issue and other small issues‚Äî like the drain disconnected in the crawl, crawl got wet, oh well, it‚Äôs a crawl, but had to meet a plumber there to reconnect it and it was cold and the plumber no showed, etc etc.... Then it cost $200... the PM I‚Äôm gonna use does cost ‚Äî $35/hr for their plumber/electrician/handyman + materials. So the whole thing would have cost $35 and some glue which is $5 for a jar if I even got charged.
I jumped in earlier this week with 1k shares at .64 cents

No. The short selling will continue
ZOM does this consolidation thing every time before a pop. Been in since .39. It just trades side ways and coil up. 

Look at BNGO and the coil they had at the $1 range, specifically Dec 28th, BNGO had the break over the New Years and then flew on the 4th,  first day back after a long weekend is always great, we have MLK day and the Biden Inauguration happening plus there will be a new round of stimulus within weeks of Biden taking office now. The Dems  controlling both house and senate and people are going to look for opportunities to load up there Robinhood accounts and find something to run with. With so many thing happening before March I know this will break it‚Äôs 2018 high of $2.98 at least but I think it has a good chance to fly to a stupid price and then pull back as it should. It‚Äôs the perfect storm for this stock!
Aight spce.

Don‚Äôt fucking tell me it had this 20% day bc cathie woods is buying?
That‚Äôs exactly what the market has been pricing in the last couple of weeks.

if every dem in the senate supports the bill, it STILL takes 60 votes to override a fillibuster, and a bill with a poison pill like a $15 minimum wage isn't going to meet that threshold.

Is PDT tied to the brokerage account or owner?
Social media is the Dems' bitch. I wouldn't touch it.
If you purchase an option, no matter what, your max loss is the cost of the option. 

If you sell an option your max loss is the current stock price minus the option's strike price. For example if a stock is 10 and you sell a 15 call and then the stock goes to 20, you max loss would be current price (20) minus option strike price (15) for a loss of 5.
I remember when we use to make fun of share buyers around these parts. What happened?

So here is what I will say. I think we have to have some down moments at this point. Maybe we will have another year where some of us get 110% but I can say for certain that 3 years in a row without some down turns no way in hell. So it is best to just trim some off. Put some in muni Bonds. Take 20% out. Just imagine a 10-20% drop in stocks overall and think what you can buy back with that 20% in muni bonds. I am getting ready do this myself. Having said all this a 20% dip is for sure a great buy since fed is at 0% and said for next 3 years it will be there. But it won‚Äôt be like this forever maybe we will get record earnings this year and have another up year but rest assure there will be some down turns on the way there at the very least a rotation out of risk on assets.

I‚Äôm luckily over $25K now in the account I daytrade in.
I'm afraid of how often we are being discussed in the regular media
Wtf is Canada
I wouldn‚Äôt play downside dude, I‚Äôd scale in longs below 45
Matches Teslas price on open
Ain‚Äôt no thang. It goes up and down. Last week I gained $115k, this week I dropped $20k. I‚Äôm still a‚Äôight.
Yeah, this is what a lot of people don't realize with minimum wage. If you can't provide greater than $15 per hour in value to your company, they aren't going to pay you $15 per hour. I would 100% expect the lowest paid jobs that can be automated - like cashiers at fast food restaurants - will largely go away. You already see the 8 cash registers at supermarkets with 1 monitor to help people... that will only be sped up with a higher minimum wage.
> lucky timing

Lmao how delusional is this guy. In what ways is 2005 lucky timing. 2005-2008 was still a pretty shitty time for growth stocks, the NASDAQ in particular. Lucky timing would be investing right at the start of the 2009 bull run. Anyway, at what point does luck just become normal? If after 16 years your strategy is still losing are you just unlucky or is it a shit strategy?

No surprise Tesla cars are amongst the safest although for real life situations other cars might be better
Bought PLTR 1/15 27.5c as a lotto and huh might actually work out
Tesla about to pop off next week

One night a few months from now I will go to bed with 300 shares of APHA, and the next morning I will wake up with 250 shares of TLRY :) 

I will drink a Sweetwater 420 Pale Ale to celebrate, since they are owned by APHA now as well!
GME futures????
I feel this quote applies:


>A serious problem in planning against American doctrine is that the Americans do not read their manuals, nor do they feel any obligation to follow their doctrine.
‚Äì Soviet observation during the Cold War
"People just want to believe...That doing something must be better than doing nothing."

"The only wrong choice is not doing anything!"

Somebody good at maths, how much do y‚Äôall think BB 2/19 12.50Cs will be worth at open? Wanted to take advantage of tomorrow‚Äôs pop at open but now I‚Äôm thinking i bought too far out for max gains. They‚Äôre currently $.76 but that was at close pre AH pop. Hold?
Stop, I can‚Äôt get any harder!
‚ÄúOfficials working on the Trump administration‚Äôs data collection efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic have suggested to transition officials for President-elect Joe Biden that the new team get rid of a newly minted system originally designed by the Silicon Valley company Palantir, warning that it is not accurate.‚Äù

Some game developers should be making exclusive GME DLC content with this dude as a character. Like Warcraft did with Leroy Jenkins, but exclusive for gamestop purchases.
