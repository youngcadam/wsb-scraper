Your friend: Trading is boring I think I'm gonna close my account. Anyways thanks for the free Google share or whatever.For the noobies, PLUG was a banned ticker on WSB 1 year ago and if you talked about it you were labeled a “shill” or “pump and dump” 🤡Just got a message that I was permanently banned from r/personalfinance for posting about the ETFs: ICLN, ARKG, ARKK, LIT

The post I commented under was asking about advice on which ETFs they should add to their portfolio, and so I recommend some of the ones that I have in my portfolio. The mods mentioned that I was “trolling” and broke a rule that apparently does not allow people to post about either of those ETFs. 

I was genuinely trying to help. What the fuck.My father died today.  Hug your kids/parents just a little bit longer today.I think I’m addicted to this subredditUsually I'm good with "profit is profit" but my missed profit on PLUG is going to make me sickI day trade TSLA stock options just to feel alive.Jack Ma locked in a cave somewhere trying to make an Ironman suit out of spare parts laying aroundYou motherfuckers who are like:

And then you have all the plays that you were thinking about making( all the fomo plays) but didn't, just take off and gap up 100% in a week. One time that happens, fine. Twice, you're probably really annoyed. But to have it happen again and again, shit is fucking exhausting. Been trading for years and while I'm happy to see a lot of you make a killing, I'm starting to think whether something like that will ever happen to me.

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

ICLN had a 'golden cross' moment (my first green arrow from left to right: 7EMA passing 100EMA). As soon as this occurred, there was an influx in volume (400K volume) spike, mostly options driven. Of those options, 73% were bulls (calls) and 27% were bears (puts). Majority lead, bulls. The average price target on options was at a $1.98 above it's current trading value which is $32.34, which puts the majority of the bullish call options around a \~$34 call. As a result, the relative strength index (bottom green arrow) has been tapering around 65%. This indicates potential further upwards momentum. And for those who didn't read this... here are some rockets.  🚀🚀🚀  TLDR: $ICLN Call options in April/July at $34C will print, anticipate the ticker to hit a $34C by Friday post-Biden announcement.

> THIS IS THE MOTHER OF ALL BUBBLES

Someone call patrick star in here, he can stretch a bubble like a mofoJust late night thoughts... I don’t post much on Reddit but I was thinking VALE is probably going to the moon.

My thought process behind it is Apple is working on a EV. Tesla is dominating the market with EV. Nickel will be in super high demand but the main point is VALE strive on being an eco friendly mining company. Which Apple and Tesla both push for being eco friendly in their companies. If Apple works with another manufacturer they are going to make sure that they play by apples rules. Apple rules mean eco friendly no matter what. Just like removing all charging bricks from phones watch’s and even there wireless chargers. 

So to summarize Apple and Tesla will both need nickel for there cars and VALE is a cleaner mining company. VALE to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes upl gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies report blowout Q4 earnings and give super optimistic guidance for 2021. However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. 

Have a nice rest of the evening folks!

$35c June is the most liquid strike and expiration.I just want Cathie to tuck me in and read me a bed time story.

AAPL 420c 1/15Nice I gambled away all my money and have nothing left to pay for college

Was good knowing youPresident Biden, with the help of a Democrat-controlled House + Senate, will pump $2.4 trillion into the sector during 2021. My prediction is that sometime in the next 5 years, **ICLN** will cost $300+ per share (maybe more). Getting it now is still an absolute steal. Get in now before the real pump happens. This is once in a lifetime opportunity, we haven't seen an infrastructure change like this since the industrial revolution. The dam has broken, and smart money, even oil companies such as Shell and BP, have already started pouring funds into the clean energy sector.

The energy sector is about to turn upside down and clean energy will be the only way to power anything by 2035.

TSLA is a meme, a digital store-of-value used to escape USD devaluationr/investing has the same vibe as a middle school libraryMy pants smell like piss but I didn’t piss themI’m so pissed about this AAPL rumor.  The fact that they prefaced it with Tim Cook is such a good person means it’s going to be some big donation or some garbage and will tank their stockI feel empty and lost and I try to fill that hole with money and memes 😞Just discovered Indian Tik Tok..

Here is a legit excerpt from our friend David S.:

>I'd rather own Berkshire, and get solid returns over the next 25 years, with minimal risk allowing me to sleep at night, versus something like NIO which could go up 100% the next few years, or very possibly go back down to $10 or so... Young people chasing these high flying EV stocks haven't experienced the pain of the dot com bubble.  And they don't have families to support yet, so "preservation of capital" is not top of mind for them.  They will eventually learn.Bought 25k in PLUG puts 10 minutes before close. I'll post the loss porn tomorrow.#Aight boys

I’ve been shilling ICLN here for a week or so and we’ve made some fat racks, now ima tell you about a ticker just like PLUG.

This motherfucker has been mooning for a couple of weeks now, and hit a whopping **37%** today. As of now it’s trading at **$10.67**

The chart on this grade-A fuckable stock looks just like PLUG, and the best part is the ticker.

**SUN**/**W**

That’s right. The ticker is already in space.

Now i’m not a scientist or an astronaut, but I do know that once you’re in space it’s a **helluvalot easier to get to the moon.**

AAPL to the moonCarly Rae Jepsen years ago started as a meme, and now she’s probably the best pop artist in the world.Hot take. I was just thinking, online shopping should be like selling covered puts. Instead of announcing sell, customers bid on prices they are willing to pay for a product, you also have ATM option to purchase now. Like selling puts on a $5k Tv at $4k. The seller has the option to exercise anytime.

Edit: yes like eBay but bestbuy and Costco doing it with all their return customer service etc...Okay, hear me out guys. 
Apple’s big news is this: all stores are for vaccines, and if you get one, you get a discount on the new Hyundai/canoo vehicle, but they will keep tabs on you with palantir, and will partner with Tesla for their batteries. All this while going green by using PLUG to power all their stores. 
That covers all the meme stocks, right?Hows everyone doing tonight?I'm going to say the grossest thing ever. I just buy. I never sell. I guess I'm an investor...?Bears holding out their empty portfolios by the bus stop:

> While Canoo now has the money it sought at the beginning of 2020, that hasn’t softened its ambitions to work with big companies like Apple. The startup said in that same SEC filing that it is “currently in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging Canoo’s technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.” 

My reading of this article is that previous Apple talks fell apart, not that current/future ones are off the table.Apple was willing to buy Canoo, and the executives/board had the confidence in their company to reject the acquisition. Now, months later, they got a partnership with Hyundai and coincidentally Apple is partnering with Hyundai too.So much apple news so little apple tendiesCanoo gang, idk what the fuck happened, but we're waking up on the moon tomorrowAAPL pls flyAnother day, another EV SPAC popping off in my accountI would give my left nut for a massively Green Day tomorrow.🛶🛶🛶 my Canoo calls printing tomorrow!!!

When his next SPAC is announced for either IPOD/IPOF, sell once the stock exceeds 50% gains at opening (calls w/ 500% gain), or exercise your calls if you're a LT investor (which I know none of you degenerates are). Chamath's the best marketer in the game right now. He will make you money, but you have to be positioned.[deleted]This market is gonna trade sideways forever apparently. Every dip gets bought up because people think it’s never gonna go lower. Then every new high gets sold off because valuations suddenly matter at that point unless it’s the Russell 2000. 🤡🤡Feeling like shit because you missed the PLUG train? KTOS is the next rocket.

Thank you Mr. Sanders and Buyden. As the new Budget Committee Chair, Sanders wants to rev up stimulus, and pump cash into the economy to help build it back up. He'll use reconciliation to get most things Buyden wants thru the senate. It should now be fairly easy to get funding for stimulus, healthcare, climate change, etc.

Issuer:  Affirm Holdings, Inc.

Offering:  Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO

The registration statement for Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO WILL NOT be declared effective and the offering priced this evening, 01/12/2021.  Therefore Personal Investments (PI) has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering for the following reasons: 

PI is required by the SEC to obtain confirmations on indications of interest after effectiveness but before secondary market trading in Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO begins.  The Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering is NOW expected to be declared effective tomorrow morning, 01/13/2021 and trading in the secondary market will begin immediately afterwards.  As a result, there would be insufficient amount of time for PI to obtain customer confirmations and complete the allocation process prior to the security's trading in the secondary market.  Therefore, PI has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering.

Population of India = 1.366 billion
Population of China = 1.398 billion
World population = 7.794 billion

Total market of India and China represent 35% of the world's population. 

Therefore, TSLA valuation deserves 35% of the world's total money supply which is $80.9 trillion according to [Business Insider ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/all-of-worlds-money-in-one-chart-2015-12%3famp). This roughly translates to about $30,000 per share.

So the world has rendered money useless and instead people use their "time" as a form of currency. So if you want a coffee well that cost a minute of your life. And your wages are paid in extra time. So in the stock market we can gamble our time and to actually YOLO you can literally die or become immortal.Why are you retards awake?holy shit GOEV 👀Giant green dildo on ICLN 🤑🤑🤑Dua lipaMy retired mom bought TSLA shares in the March dip because she heard about it from her boomer friends. Obviously she's up a lot, so she started getting interest in TSLA and decided to sell her paid-off car and buy a Tesla car. Cool, it's her money and she's buying a cool car. The problem is, she called me this morning and told me she ordered a Model S and because she's not using a gas car anymore, she ordered the Tesla solar roof thing, the battery pack, and the Tesla wall charger. She basically dropped $100k on Tesla products because she's up a bit on the stocks. Not only that, when I went to her house to talk to her after the call, I found a poster of Elon Musk hung up next to my dead dad's ashes.

The execs didn’t want to be acquired and Apple wanted an acquisition. That means Apple really wanted access to the skateboard technology.

And now, almost a year later, Apple is talking with Hyundai who is partnered with Canoo. If Apple wants Canoo’s skateboard tech this badly, other companies will want it as well.“CCIV is crashing”

I've seen very few stocks be able to maintain any upwards momentum when they get that stretched. There will be at least one fat red daily candle for you to profit off of. Just have to get out once you get that red day or two, don't baghold.

Part of the reason why this works is because 90 on the daily is just crazytown. TSLA has only managed it once or twice. PLUG is actually still below 90 as of close today.Lottery grand prize is over 1 Billion dollars. Going all in.

Give me some advice pls!Lol Apple didn’t go with canoo. Keep paddling retards.Hear me out. 
What if apple partners with Tesla to produce its apple car. Elon knows about it and decide to make the apple tweet- as a way of cryptically telling us? 

Tim apple said we have something huge that isn’t a product— an apple car produce by Tesla. Would be huge. 

Not a product but a partnership. Paired by musks tweet today— you’re going to make it. 

Doesn’t Seem far fetched. Might load up on $1000c just for fun.Can we get Shep Smith off CNBC I don’t give a fuck about 🥭 or his shitI think Apple might buyout ParlerJust want to fast forward to tomorrow to look at my GOEV callsWas talking to my dad and asked if he owned any TSLA stock.

Tesla "Model $25k" being accelerated to 2022 is 𝙝𝙪𝙜𝙚 news: previous assumption was 2024-2025, and few TSLA valuation models include it.

With a $25k entry price Tesla can cover ~90% of the $5t automotive market by revenue (!).

Thanks jim say hi to the kidsIf you’re wondering why TSLA is not mooning on good news it’s cause all the good news about TSLA is priced in and it already mooned ladsDumb question but why do some of my upvotes show in red and then sometimes they are in green?How do you guys find all of these retarded companies?Angry orchard really isn’t very good tbhSince all of you are going to be rich soon I have some real world advice. If you fly less than 150 hours a year private do not buy your own private jet! Also if you do PLEASE for the love of god make sure the engines are on Corporate Care / Gold. Fucking things are $$$ and just because you have 3000 hours before TBO does not mean some Mechanic Jackass will not say one needs a overhaul / replacing during the annual!Fuck me. My gf is making money with PLUG and TSLA while I’m here watching my GOEV and PLTR calls do nothing...No one will ever see this...

It's the decent thing to doLast earnings it didn't crash as hard as it typically does immediately after earnings, but it did crash none the less. If you have calls I'd offload them asap, stock I'd hold on to unless you bought near the top.Why not?Probably glitch.  TDA shows 104.35volatility will kill you once or twice and wipe out all your gains from the weekly sells. They are covered calls so you still make some money but theres better ways to invest 13000. 

For this strategy I would look at SPY a little more money and volatile but you have 3 expirations a week so you can sell much more against it with a shorter time horizon.

You don't necessarily need to buy 100 shares for the spy strategy you can just buy a call 6-8 months out and then roll the profits into another one 6- 8 months and not let the theta catch your call if its not moving into the money enough,

I started doing this right before September crash and still broke even after the elections.Do it. AAPL moves steady enough to make good $ selling CC’sIt’s kinda shitty. At 127 I sold a Cc for $130 and only got like $100 bux for it. It ended up shooting to 132 so i ended up worse off by the time it expired.Or use the same money to buy LEAPS and sell even more CCs.
