I’m gonna make **tens of dollars**Tim Cook spoke at my college commencement and it was the worst speech I’ve ever heard, so preachy and fake woke like bro you literally have slave labor making your productsICLN paper hands morons in shamblesTim Cook today announced that he can't be racist because he in fact has a black friend.Buy PLTR. That is all.PLTR is ruining my reputation as a WSB traderBiggest lesson from 2020: if the company makes money, stay the fuck away from itPLTR was finally breaking out and was looking good till Demo Day and of course some cucktard analyst comes in with a downgrade to tank this shit so they can buy in. Absolute fucking BS. Wait till the rest of WSB wakes up and sees the downgrade....we buying the fucking dipMy favorite pre market activity is watching AAPL be up 1% and watching it bleed all the way down to red by open.PLTR finally started looking good and now this.Citi just wiped out all these PLTR 30c holdersBlack airpodsOn adderall and going to take a practice LSAT exam, wish me luck boys!Hey everyone, thought I’d try to bring you some alternative data every day in these daily discussion threads.

I got up at an ungodly early hour to post this right when the thread was made, so I apologize if I take a while to get a respond to any early questions, I'm sleeping till market open.

Here's what was mentioned the most in the "Tomorrow's Moves" thread for today:

|Stock|Mentions|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**TSLA**|345|\+39|
|**NIO**|260|\-36|
|**ICLN**|215|\+26|
|**GME**|113|\+35|
|**PLTR**|93|\+20|imagine 10 year from now somebody will be saying damn bro is that an apple icar 10 max plus pro*Buyden slaps roof of stock market*
"This bad boy can fit so many fucking ICLN pumps in it"Somebody really said “ARKK is up $7 from my investment, should I sell?”

Are some of you actually this retarded? Honestly, wow.If ur selling PLTR at open idk what to tell you other than to enjoy ur lossesBout to DM the baddest chick I see on the gram and ask her when are you going to spend a night with an autistWhen I drop $10k on a stock simply cuz someone put a bunch of rocket emojis next to it I feel like an investor. 

When I fill out mega millions and power ball tickets at the bodega I feel like a degenerate gambler.Palantir must have secured another contract for it to be dying this hard in PM.Jan. 12th: APPL has a big announcement that is NOT a new product.

Jan. 13th: WSB, why no product announcement!?Imagine being the ceo and your stonk moons 7% on your resignation

Citi can go suck a dick.Valuable lesson: you should be most scared when you’re on a winning streak. Don’t get cocky. Don’t overextend yourself. If you feel you’re trading on emotion, walk away. There’s always another play and another day. 🤟Yo PLTR whats you doingIf PLTR ONCE AGAIN does it’s move of reversing its pre market direction...I will do a little half smile and shake my head slightly.Trying to muster up all of my strength to pretend to give a shit on my 30 minute conference call.

i dont know about you fellas, but this makes perfect sense considering I buy a new flatscreen tv every week while I only buy food once every 5 years.Just read the “big announcement” by Tim Apple and I am lost for words. A private corporation that produces all of its products in sweatshops in Asia wants to educate people on social injustice. America is truly in the middle age😂ICLN goin up today?At this point I wish AAPL would dump another U2 album on us...Tesla giving such a good fight in the pre market, let’s hope for 880-900 EODTSLA price target is 900. we'll be hitting resistance on the way. godspeed ladies and gentlemen.I hope GME rips through $24.

Racial Justice project? Fuck you Tim. 

Tell me more about racial injustice why you use slave labor you giant cuck hypocrite.Citi is worse than CitronDaddy Karp should get on twitter so he can reverse uno card all these ghey downgradersCiti is against retards. PLTR NIODear citi,

You use word “downgrade”, yet you increase PT. I do not think you know what word meansICLN is doing the thingyAAPL is gonna be red by open and my calls will be fucked.I think APPLE made a mistake, people that care about racism know that is a poor atempt to wash their image as one of the biggest corporations that represents capitalism as It's worst, so they will not care about this program and at the same time they are moving away from part of the customers. Bad and expensive advertasing campaing in my opinion. On the other hand I am just an Europoor that bought PLTR 2 days ago so not the best one to give financial adviceCramer on team GME now 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀the market must be racistTim slept with a black dude and he comes out with a $100million initiativePalantearsAlright racism is canceled this year.

Apple doesn’t ever share ANYTHING until close to launch, why would that change now, especially considering the EV would be the biggest announcement they’ve made since iPhone? Do you really think Timmy would just pop up on morning talk show to drop that shit with no presentation or keynote?Upgrade SNOW, which has had absolutely 0 news but downgrade PLTR. Makes sense.

How do you downgrade to sell on a hunch, this is a jokeFuck AAPL. I’m going to lose so much money on calls. All they had to do was go up $10 in 3 months and I would have made money.I made my daughter say a prayer for TSLA before I dropped her off for kindergarten. You can thank me later.Citi just downgraded PLTR to sell. RIPPLTR could cure cancer and analysts would still downgrade its stock value to $10 🙄Hey this is Tim Cook we haven’t done anything innovative in 5 years so here’s some money black pplI'm such a greedy fucker. The longer I spend here the more greedy I become. Suddnely increasing my account by 40% in a year is not good enough. I need to at least 2x it and better is 10x it this year. And even then I still need to get multples on it maybe next year to reach my net worth goals that will allow me to buy an apartment. 

I spent several hours on Zillow over the weekend and picked out a bunch of 1M+ apartments to shoot for. 

I know this is completely delusional but I also have nothing else to do with my spare time and its so fun and addicting.pltr downgraded again wtf. is instant red on downgrade. bleeds slowly on upgrade.PLTR fought against citi... buying calls in the morningBears: call an ambulance, but not for me 🔫Hey Tim, do the lives of uighers matter to you?

Palantir announced the Army down-selected it to deliver a prototype for the first phase of the Army's Ground Station modernization in support of the Army's Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node program. The contract value for this phase is $8.5M, with a potential contract value of approximately $250M over all 4 phases. Palantir was awarded a Phase 1 Project Agreement through an Other Transaction Agreement with Consortium Management Group on behalf of Consortium for Command, Control and Communications in Cyberspace. During the first phase of the effort, Palantir will collaborate with the Army to design and demonstrate the ground station prototype solution for the Army's TITAN program. The Palantir solution will leverage space, high altitude, aerial, terrestrial sensors and data sources for use in intelligence and military targeting operations. It will field a "turn key" solution for the Army that integrates data from a variety of sources including commercial and classified sources from space to ground sensors. The results of the first phase of this competitive contract will be used by the Army to inform awarding of future phases and eventual production of the ground station for the TITAN enterprise.Citi downgrade and new contract = double downgrade 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡That's it selling apple and buying more GME.Tim Apple is a cuckI hate aapl.

It just cant grow anymore and has to pander to the madness of crowdsReading some of the tickers you clowns are jumping into rn makes me believe many of you legitimately DO enjoy losing your money 🤣

A toddler with 5 crayons shoved up its ass could pick better tickers 

(I’m looking at you DoorDash calls as a hedge guy)Apple embracing their white guilt and handing jobs and money to black people is bearish right?I don't get why companies take on these socially charged initiatives with company money.  Tim, if you want to tackle systemic racism, good for you (honestly), but do so with your own fucking fortune.  You can still get the morally-driven investors' attention without dipping into Apple's massive cash pile (which by the way is becoming less attractive when it's used like this).[deleted]GOEV is the new short squeeze play, buying another 500 shares on openWhy they downgrading our boy PLTR?All my homies hate citiPlease nioFellow Palantards, today we received a vicious and malicious attack from those citi cucks, remember we must hold the line!

LolI am done with MSFT honestlyI just want to be remembered as the reason this is happening, so you're welcome. Bought 4k worth of 1/15 and 1/22 $21c on Monday,  sold yesterday afternoon when I realised GME didn't present at ICR for a -50%. They're literally worth 12k now. So whoever has my extra $10,000 -- you're welcome.GME 😐GME to $100Gonna not look at stocks until tomorrow, hope gme triples eodWas $24-27 Melvin covering as-hoe?lets break out from 26, keep buying!are GME gang still holding till death?Apples new diversity dividend giving $1000 to all non white shareholders#Guh-evFor real though, AAPL probably realized they had 99% market share for white people and significantly less in the African American, latino, etc communities - this is probably a low-key hella smart tactic to pull Samsung/Google smartphone customers into the Apple ecosystem and App Store where a lot of the LTV comes fromJust imagine if slavery was legal somewhere in the world, how lit the iPhones made there would be.  Just sick profit margins.

That's how schizophrenic capitalism is.So GOEV pumped because of the upcoming Apple announcement? Which turned out to be about racial justice?????Do you think Tim 🍎 will let the Uyghur slaves who build his iPhones use his black only learning centers?PLTR is like PFE now lol. Boomer stock.God. Fucking. Dammit. I’m so sick of this shit. I know these are leaps but this is going to sting today. Should I sell and trade for AAPL leaps or just hold these hoping they recover in next 3 months? I fucking swear this stock can’t catch a break

https://imgur.com/a/9IP2gIJThis is online version of r/publicfreakoutI leveraged hard and got wiped out yesterday. Hopped in the paper trading and lost all of paper money.

Every cent you drop costs me money. So inconsiderate!BFT and my gf are nothing alike, BFT loves going down on meFuck shitibank glad i cancelled all my cards last year. So shitty that it hasnt recovered since 2009.💩How is it not illegal for “analysts” to downgrade a stock then scoop up shares when it dipsCore CPI data released for the US at 8:30 AM.  There has been speculation by some of the Federal Reserve members about inflation rising sooner than the current FOMC outlook.  If the Core CPI numbers are higher than expected, the market may go down today.  This could signal that these FOMC members predictions might have some weight, meaning interest rates going up sooner than anticipated currently.GME gang is the most sensitive 🌈 gang.

Everytime I make jokes they all charge in with full seriousness 🤣

Don't know what your government is telling you but if trends continue shit is gonna go full lock down. They just put 8pm curfew in one province and only leaving house for food and the Dr. in my province. Busting people left and right for violations. Shit is gonna get very bad for a few months.

Anyone else buying the dip and bagholding?apple car doesnt have the appeal, i mean its cool to have an iphone, but lets be honest how many people can afford an apple car, unless its $25k i dont see apple winningWHY IS PLTR GETTING ALL THIS HATE. IT'S LITERALLY UNFAIRNIO puts printing 🤑PLUG is the most retard strength stock I've ever seen.

I will average down my puts.AAPL mega trash i bet whatever they announce today will make it go downieI hate 🍏The market isn't even open yet you goddamn retardsThe past few days it's been getting in my head that I should
sell ~5% of my TSLA position.

E.g. sell $25,000 today.  TSLA will continue to go up, perhaps
to $1000+ during this year.

Next January, sell another $25,000.  TSLA will crash mid-year.
But if it doesn't, then the next January sell another $25,000, etc.

The TSLA rise may continue for another 3 or 5 years, who knows,
but it's been 13 years since a recession.  There's got to be one,
5 years from now tops.

I don't like doing a lot of little transactions, but this seems to
me the best way.

I don't like taking the tax hit, letting it ride is much safer,
but I'm just starting to feel antsy.  (Of course, last time I felt
antsy I sold a boatload of TSLA at $890 pre-split.)

Also, my kids are having some issues and it's looking like
child care costs are going to triple for two of our kids.  Starting
to feel the pinch for cash again.Guys, Apple going full BLM is bullish. They just got the entire black market in the states. Now, Samsung will look like racists, cause they didn’t do it first. Q2 sales are gonna be ridiculous now....and TSLA is green. Nice try TSLA bears'You can go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy'

Be very very careful entering call positions at this point.What just happened with PLTR??????!!!Umph Citi downgraded PLTR to sell.GOEV gang what's the move at open, hold strong or sell?If we all just agree to buy PLTR we might make it move upwards with out retard strengthF u NIOIs anyone getting in GOEV?It keeps making a lower lowAnyone else hear rumors of $ZM being added to S&P?KO shares are still at a discountSlowly going cash gang over the last few days because I’m seeing some wacky shit.

The stock I'm talking about is LMND, IPO in July at $29, traded as high as $188 yesterday (526% in 7 months) when they announced the stock dilution.Any 1/15 lottos to play? I have $25k to gamble.

Change my mindCongress is wasting time today trying to impeach a President that is on his way out of office and probably will never be a viable candidate again.

I don’t care if you like Trump or not, that’s a monumental waste of time and resources for their own political gain. During a pandemic they also used for political gain at our cost..

Blackberry has always been betterapple green within an hour of opening? bullish AF\- AAPL does some snowflake awareness move.  
\- All of DC is fucking blue.  


While MSFT and AMZN are slapfighting over JEDI deal and other contracts that seem to matter, AAPL is doing a power play to get full govt support seeing as they cater to giving made up electric vehicles specifically for the two-spirit transgender navajo fox-kin.   
AAPL is playing n-th D Chess. Bullish and yes I know this is a Wendy's.Get ready for four years of pointless virtue signaling.Lol pltr just got a quarter billion dollar contract and is crashing because of a hit job by Citi. Literally makes no sense.TSLA.., you are dead to me. You bastard.AAPL is just marketing to their future consumers. Same way Nike supported the kneeling.

Team RKT or GME Gang?Anybody in GOEV for the long haul? Feeling bullish when a company like Apple in talks of buying them and they're just looking for investment and it sounds like other blue chips in talks with them, partnered with hyundai.

Holding shares that I just bought before the pop and 2 5/21 30c contracts and feeling like the right move might be to sell one contract at the top today and let the rest ride.

Or im the only retardFUBO is a sports streaming service that yesterday announced they are buying a sports book company to accelerate their entry into sports gambling. Draftkings sits at a market cap of around 40b and they do not have a streaming service. Fubo is sitting around 2.5b. If they can grow their gambling business, which should be easy given they already have a subscriber base, we could see a huge jump in the next year or so. Also, fubo was trading in the 60s a few weeks ago but dropped down to the 30s. Could easily see a run back to the 60s and beyond in the coming monthsMy calls in ICLN went up 33% yesterday, hope to see it again today!Aapl fuckWhat is going on with AMD?Imagine being outperformed by INTC 🤡This AMD drop might literally be the most retarded panic selling i have seen in my life?

Also, first step in being decent: stop it with the slave labor, ridiculousGuys a play like a short squeeze does not have longevity. When it happens, you need to take profits right away. After a short has covered their position (causing the squeeze), that’s it. That’s the end. There is no more fuel for the rocket at that point.

The Q3 numbers fubo reported (58% paid subscriber increase and 71% surge in revenue) were impressive, and the Q4 preliminary report shows a surprisingly strong increase in both metrics. The strategic acquisitions of Balto and Vigtory increase fubo’s competitiveness, and they will release a sports book app by the end of the year. The legal allegations against fubo seem to be without merit, and the stock has shot up over 34% in a day in spite of the allegations, so that should be telling.

---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give optimistic guidance for 2021 (due to a vaccine being available and an actual competent administration). However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. 

Have a nice day and make a lot of teddies today!

P.S.
The most liquid strike and expiration is $35c June. But looking at how it's moving even before earning season, i think even the $40c June will be ITM and print bigly before June.

You are enjoying a fully automated cruise along the pacific coast highway with your significant other and little ones in your Apple car while streaming a movie from your Apple TV across your entire windshield. The little ones grow tired of the movie and decide they now want to be entertained with video games. You prompt Siri to fire up Apple Arcade and she does so right away. The little ones are now captivated and distracted by the interactive gaming content leaving you and your significant other just enough time to pull up the divide between the front and the back of the car and do the naughty. You manage to safely finish and proceed to quickly get dressed and just as you finish getting dressed you receive a small notification in peripheral of your vision.

He is a value investor, not a trader, so he looks at stocks he is happy to own for years. I am personally bullish on BABA but I think it's going to hit 200 before it starts climbing again. When it starts showing signs of recovery I'm going to buy some for a long-term hold.Potential upside is also HUGE if jack ma is found, baba no longer delisted, and earnings good and get PT upgrades. Imagine all 3 happen, how you’d sky rocket to 300+ and this could all happen within monthsBABA held 220 bottom firmly after delisting news, doubt its going lower. Earnings in 2-3 weeks, should be huge. Can’t het delisted lol all major investors are USA funds. Biden replacing trump should help too, feels like silence before the storm.LolWhat he’s saying is IV crush is going to change deltas of OTM calls (lower) and subsequently the dealers will have to sell stock to stay delta neutral.

Good luck my dude. Not saying they aren’t over valued and won’t go down but I don’t think it will happen anytime soon. 

Your puts are wrestling with a 800 lb retarded gorilla.Imagine buying puts on clean energy stonkThe premiums on those must be insane...if you are going to short it you have to short shares and just take your lumps along the wayI’m quite concerned about that...They already announced it wtfIt’s some social justice initiative 🤡It’s garbageIt’s already announced dumbassThey announced a racial justice initiative. 100 million being funneled into areasRacistLol you have kids and you’re still holding that much TSLA? You’re nuts. Expecting tsla to just keep rising like this is nuts and letting it ride is not safer lplTSLA gonna crash. You should sell it all now and use the profits to invest somewhere elseAre they that dumb that they can be pandered to that easily?They just lost 70 million trump voters.

Gay. They should sell it to a better company.Yes and to get a cash injection without having to pay anything back ie debtThey do share offering when they need money for projects. They can’t just sell their stock in the company because that can collapse the price as well as give up control.  They usually try and announce the the price is surging as to keep a stabilized price. If you sell when it’s down you
Can destabilize your stock as well.Doesn't it mean that the company needs cash?They’re  selling shares to generate income so their earnings report isn’t dog shit, yes they believe they’re price is high and they’re trying to profit from itI know morning about LMND. Could be that, or an indication that they need more cash for either growth or to stay afloatCould indicate either high price (ZM) or they are desperate for capital (GME)One of many reasons, alot of it has to do with raising capital for whatever the company needs.Yes. Just like Tesla doing an offering at $500TSLA 880c 1/15. Sell at 20-30% and don’t look back good sir.NGAShitty bank downgrade 🤡🌈🐻Some random analyst downgraded it.Classic wsb, encouraging others to chaseDo you think it’s too late? What strikes?Would shares in PLUG be (relatively) safe?I'll hold off a little. 100% gain in 6 days I aint no FOMOWith a question like that you will be unemployed for a long time sirThey’re unrelated lolNoWhy?

🙌YepWhat is this thing next to the 20?BANWell this is how it works, Im assuming you have weeklies? or probably something expiring  soon because the way OTM/ Out the money plays work is something like if your play is going to expire in two days, why would you buy a 36$ contract and pay the premium to exercise 100 shares at 36$ when you can just buy the share right now at 22$?

&#x200B;

So Im not bragging but just giving an example, I have 23$ c and 25$c expiring in april, those are up bigly today because Im practically In the money /ITM so my contracts are more valuable because we have 4 months to get to 23/25 + we are AT 23 RIGHT NOW so that makes me contracts worth infinite amount more .

Yeah i took a 4k Loss learning options too... You really want ITM/In the money plays mostly with far out dates, 3 months ish or 6 montish, I NEVER win with OTM plays tbh, always won with somewhat ITM or like, things that take 5$ to make me money, not like 14$ in your case with 36$ calls.

&#x200B;

I love you retard, keep your head up high. We are here for you \~

&#x200B;

Edit: I FORGOT TO MENTION, IF YOU HAVE APRIL CALLS THAN YOU COULD HOLD AND MAYBE IN A MONTH WHEN WE ARE AT 30/IF WE ARE AT 30 YOUR 36$C WILL BE WORTH MORE THAN TODAY I PROMISE!!! YOU JUST NEED FAR DATED CALLS OR ROLL YOUR CALLS TO APRIL/JUNE/DECEMBER ETC/ 

OR BUY SHARES MY BROTHER!!! YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH SHARES BECAUSE ITLL KEEP GOING UP AND YOU CAN HOLD THAT FOREVER!! I BELIEVE IN YOU!!Don’t buy 80% out of the money and that won’t happenMaybe you accidentally bought puts idk bro1) Didnt say the expiration

2) you chose a contract thats more than 100% OTM if you dont include today - of course no one wants that garbageThe iDildo is coming next monthiphone sales in china red hotuse ur gains to buy sharesintc news, good dip to buy for earnings run-up tbqh.if you need another dip on gme its your fault! we have already launched theres no coming back sub $20 now$100its the Cramer squeezeJust the beginning....Nope.

Most people have to purchase them shits.Nothing is being taken away from youWhat they say?No?Wow AAPL is trying to challenge systemic racism; let me tell you how racist that isAnd let the orange have all the benefits for the rest of his life? Nah fuck that.If he's removed then no pension and perks for the rest of his life = savings of resources. *Taps head*imagine holding people accountable for their actions. Thatd be the society i wanna live inYour mom wasted time birthing you on the day you were bornKayfabe ma dudeAll those resources being wasted on a vote! The horror!Oh no, one day, that they were going to be on recess for anywaysWasting time and resources for his own gain is 🥭's MO lolSounds like someone is upset- but it’s ok to use resources for superspreaders for the last six mos.?Well, if he is guilty he should be held accountable. Also, if he is then why should we take care of him until he is dead?Lol no. “Waste of time” is the dumbest take on this situation.

This is literally congress’s chance to shut down trump fascism. If they don’t do anything because “he’s almost out of office anyway” it would be a huge mistake.>don’t care if you like Trump or not, that’s a monumental waste of time and resources for their own political gain.

You know actions have consequences, right?How else would they say “X didn’t vote to impeach Trump the second time They’re a nazi sympathizer” in two years. ?CES presentation today, rumours of Apple partnershipRumorsI’m looking to buy in a year or so, gotta build cash and hope for a crash 💥💥yep.

maybe a new CEO is actually worth that much thoughYupCareful.  Alteryx did exactly this -- new CEO in Oct 2020, went from 113 to 145 overnight and maintained that range for about a month.

Hovered for a while, but shit the bed again in NOV 2020 back down to 115 after shit earnings.

They've had much better than expected us phone sales Q4, grown to capture 20% China phone market share, grown to capture 49% laptop market share, EV news at a good time with a partner, playing ball with the new administration, and iPhone 13 coming with bigger rumored improvements than just a refresh (we'll see if the stimmy goes to these for people who havnt upgraded in abit).

Apple would also have the least to worry about out of big tech for taxes and anti-trust. Hell even this racial fund is a good thing in terms of avoiding those. 

The issue is people buying weeklies on Apple, it's an earnings and leap sort of company.This just proves the entire GME thesis.

FTNT is Fortinet (cybersecurity company), not fortnite.down 1%, falling down past 2 stdevs from median price not sure what the news im not an oil guymakes sense, but then why can’t options be traded in the premarket lolIts down 40% in a week do DD before you talk shit you idiotSo far the market has only been trading 20% of the overall share supply. When the remaining 80% becomes available what do you think will happen?True. I have 10k shares at 19.

Just when I thought it couldn’t possibly get gayerI willSameIt was a consistent ETF with cheap options with low strikes for months until last week when it started getting memed. Shit skyrocketed for 2 days and now strikes are super high even way OTMThat’s good actually. $25 million will last you 70 years spending $1000 a dayAs a minority, I cant say I disagree with you man. Especially coming from Apple, who makes their products in fucking China or India or whichever country is cheapest. Such bullshitI already did on 31st dec, need more to fuel the fireLol I'd never buy puts or calls at what...160% IV at the moment? Need like a 4% overnight move to wake up green on the shit no THX

It's funny more than anything imma short this trash laterEven with the downgrade, I think that's a good move.  Most investors know analysts and their PT's are a joke in the current market.  BTFD; I will be.Lol these fuckers just hate PLTR, I bet it's still gonna go up. Bull cycle is commencing.Yeah but they raised the PT. Always blows my mind when they do that shit.PLTR got beat down by Citron then by Morgan Stanley then by Credit Suisse, but slowly it's getting stronger and punching back. Citi's downgrade will only affect PM.I know the DD but was there a catalyst today?Tried playing TSLA twice this week. Burned massively.That’s fucking geniusSaw that. It's fucking crazy.It's true, last march was a great month.Yup. And I don’t even post nudes or porn. Just shirtless pictures that can be found on my Instagram 😄I'm not sure we have had a public official also break the norm of the big sex issue. No politician outside of the actors kennedy's has every really gotten as wild and crazy. You have to understand though that back them everyone got news from the papers and the 5-0Clock news or the 10pm news. We are in a day and age where nearly every person has a phone that is equivalent to, OR GREATER then the ibm systems used to land us on the moon. We have leaped and bounded over tech hurdles like we are olympic sprinters. Sure we have our setbacks but we have ultimately grown as a society so quickly through tech we don't see it anymore. Wrap you head around some of those ideas and get back to me. 

I just remember NC-17 RATINS AND not knowing anyone that could buy them for me. When now that level and a 1000's mor e is FREELY out there.

We have moved into a new age/era/whatever you want to call it. Tech has changed everything and we still think in PG-13 STANDARDS. That alone should show you how far behind we are.NIO is literally the example OP looking for. 

That ship sailed.Would you mind breaking down the leaps process for me? I’ve only had my fair share of success in the market buying weeklies/selling puts. Would certainly like to learn about leaps and how the returns work.Yeah sucks , that thing could of been running like a hype machineWon't they release earnings at the end of February, like 21 - 23 or so?I'm in EU, trading options on US stocks isn't just a push of a buttonIt’s a diversity initiative. Which all things considered shouldn’t harm the share price like a privacy related announcement or getting involved with vaccines.I just wanna break even on my pre-GOEV call purchase, anything else at this point is greatThe camera is killing me and he randomly starts shouting during some of his tangentsUr dad is gayGayHey...(ง’̀-‘́)ง late feb calls? or april?really tho. citibank announced their first female ceo and the stock tanked.They’re gearing up for long-term democratic reign as the republican base crumbles under Trump. 

Buy into green energy now (or like several months ago). Sell shortly before 2022 elections, buy according to the results of that.

Edit: stop editing your comment. You’ve completely changed it like 3 times now smhNo, it isn't.  This is over.  Amazon has vast documentation of Parler users committing crimes, and Parler refusign to moderate its own criminal content in breach of agreement.  In addition, 0 merit to competition as there are numerous other services (who also deny this sort of behavior) available to host.   In order for Parler to win, they would have to convince a court that corporations should be FORCED to host illegal and immoral content, no matter what their contract stipulates, and that ALL hosting services other than aws are not competition.Buy low sell high bruhIt rises after hours and dumps at open every day..I thought my 1/15 60c from summer was dead.🤡I think he's doing okay ;)Haha thankshater.

So it is going to happen?Are you sure it wasn’t just me three times?Think it may piggyback?Honestly, probably a decent idea. If you’ve have your day trade safety net just get FD’s.Ya never know with this marketConversely, it has concerned me greatly how this global etf has somehow exploded to become the second most mentioned ticker on this sub. I don’t get it. I’m invested myself and this sub has a tendency to be late to the party, so is icln another Palantir, GME, or spce where a few early people made money, it became super popular ticker and the creator of thousands of bagholders? I keep reminding myself that, no, it can’t be another Palantir or GME by its very nature as a global etf, but if you just were to read the posts themselves and didn’t know that, you’d think it was falling victim to the same fate.Not going to $800 then?I bought at +23% expecting it to stay there all day.

But ya, have fun being gay.Short squeeze is a ridiculous myth and it's impossible for it to happen again. Why take such a risk when there is company with more future and better chances?

Edit: also to the comment belowThey wouldn’t understand...I got out at 26.80I have more karma in 59 days (all form this sub) then you do 

SoWhy do you even try to reason with them bruh...Seriously? It still hasnt even surpassed its ATH back in early 2020 when it spiked over 900 briefly for two days.😂😂All that butt action really got you heated huhI did. I am in actuality a very serious and intelligent person!!!!!+1, really like the streetsmartedge platform.heard some stocks weren't available on rh and wanted to move up a little. i didn't think i'd be able to make this much money off of trading, so hitting 5k is a good indicator for whether or not i'm serious about this. it's more of a personal thing, and i'm looking to fund my way through grad school with my gains and hold stocks until i die. 

i just got the vibe that rh is like entry level. i've got a good 2k to go before i got 5k, so i'll see how things look for me tbh.thank you bro this actually was some pretty good insight. do you trade options at a high volume? and how much would you actually keep in your rh account at one time? i'm scared of not being able to transfer out my gains or some shit lolThat news has been going all week.   Futures were green at 5am. Now I checked and it's redYeah, they’re ass fucking those people too leveraged.Agree lol

Its too stupid a play, even for wsbfed printing tho ?It’s at $23?

Poor effort50% gain this is the wayI like your style guy, take some silverapparently lolllllWow 🙄Yea...so ignorant!🥇No doubt it will hit 30 at some point. Just going to be a slow frustrating climb, I believe.

Give it a couple of quarters and we will be rewarded 200%they don’t it’s just a joke😭No that racism has endedWell they might slowly tread into profitability which will make them a decent company but if they can't hyperscale then don't expect the stock price to go up much from here.Yeah at the core it’s absolutely just a PR thing. Democratic administration, which is generally tougher on tech, favors minorities. People need to connect the dots moreLmao I hear ya man, it would be super. Expect breadcrumbs throughout the year 😞I doubt MARA hits 1300so, you want them to give more?the methodology behind this calculation is giving <5k RH portfolio vibes.Strap in boyoIdk either I was just asking about his PE because I wanna know what workouts can make my hair look like thatAwesome dude 🤙I agree completely.

I can see them doing huge things.Aye, i've heard of that. Sounds like it may be worth itApparently retards are buying it lolBut it's definitely a long term hold1/2022 leaps...That is fucked upIght, imma go all in calls in DASHThey sell xboxs so they got that atleastFrom my limited research, it seems like they will be a large player in the smart home and smart car revolution (because come on, we've known for 50 years that technology will progress us to the Jetsons level)

Even their website is entirely different than I expected, I was very impressed with the substantial changes they've made to their company (at least on the surface level)

Also, peep the deal they have with Canoo (GOEV) to design their ADAS for the smart cars, and GOEV has connections to Hyundai, which has connections to AAPL...I'm not tbh. I think this a good play.

I can’t even defend this as a progressive .wonder who that could beyikesGot it, loading up to the titsAh more, more stimmy! Perfect!I have ACI and KR in my long term.It's not illegal to be in both, homie.I made some money of a few swing trades in October but maybe it’s time to get back to basics.I mean they are still tech and tech has been on a bad run of dumping after earnings but this intel news could be a great catalyst.I feel ya. Sorry bro bro hopefully the market sees this too at openBut it's still down premarket.... :( I need to see a 27$+++ brake to sleep well again...Didn't I just read this exact comment?Lol...this thing went up 100$ in a week..5$ is nothingi have a lot in shares and a 6/18 122.96 call. I'm not even close to being ready to sell that yet. Up 60%.ICLNLol I’ve been holding ICLN for a long time too but I’m not really qualified to give advice. I just thought ahead to what industries would do well with a Democrat in charge and got lucky to choose some winnersIt's split, retard. The majority is 11 seats in the House and the VP is the tie breaker in the Senate. Manchin and the other moderates are the power brokers. The Green New Deal and whatever else are dead on arrival.I’ve got 855 1/15’s

Pray for us.It’s just gunna do that thing where I sell and then on the day my calls would have expired, skyrocket.Ya 2020 was fun but that’s the pastRSI on the 10 and 20 day chart is bonkers. Been above 70 for virtually the last week. It literally cannot sustain this, one because it’s not TSLA, and two because they lose money. I expect this to be in mid 180s today.ya defenses are aggressive at 860Sorry Jerome 🙏🏻 JPOW 🚀The children have tiny hands give them a breakHmm that’s weird just one single titty flash, but I’ve never seen a titty before irl so you’re winning 😩😩It’s coming back up!Oh you are the guy that keeps taking my moneyThey did a direct offering, not an ipoPeople did not expect this kind of announcement (because they have unhealthy expectations) in my opinion and for this trading day I think the announcement won't move the stock price up.I think more of sideway action, but don't take my word on it.Never selling shares babyyy. Also if you think a war isn't coming to lift countries out of the recession you are seriously retarded btw.Nah, you’re just a retardI might have to bail out of this company with all this woke bullshit unless it brings in extra profitsSo am I!

This is the way.They can say whatever they want.

But when the “joke” falls flat and people want to cancel these people, they aren’t allowed to get upset.

His tweet is saying that he wishing he could say derogatory things towards groups of people without getting any backlash for it.😔 yepIf it hits 30 I’ll probably sell half, I’m a pussyI have a July 16 2021 Call at the 3200 strike that I purchased for $30,500. 

It's down to aobut $29k right now and was as low as 27k when it dipped yesterday. 

Should've held off purchasing it last week woulda got in at a much better price but oh well.Lol my current play I entered yesterday MOMO 15$ 7/16 calls , now the Iv just started to increase so either get in now or never 
I won’t hold it close to expiration at most I’m holding for a month maybe 2 . It’s been beat up the past year so I think it runs the fuck up before earnings.I agree. The DD was my convincer

Bought 3 different strike/expiry combos and they all printed yesterday in the runup. Hopefully they moon after conference tooEh I don’t see them getting back to where they were since the big company’s are making their own chips or using amd nowI held deep itm weeklies (30.5 1/15c) overnight but planning on selling at least 90% around open. Then roll out after the mid morning dip 🤞🚀 🌙No clue.I’m not talking shit, I’m talking memeLol yea exactly.

So sorry for your massive gainsWell at least you made some money. Nothing wrong with that. I just don't see a scenario where I sell any GME at least until the summer.fuck yes, so 2 🚀🚀 or 3🚀🚀🚀 is what you’re sayingSounds great man. As I build up more money I'll try and do my best to roll it over til the summer which is when it will really take off from there. It's an excellent recovery play and this before any new price targets, updated news or anything so far.News were 1 month old

ICLN has calls for sale that expire January 2022.

Longest I think I held was 2 days onceYup and it’s cheap af. I’ll always be bullish on cyber security.I like it, that was the exact position I was looking at as well. Will buy at open today.lolzDidn’t realize you were saying Bank of America. First glance just thought you were aiming to claim bofa these nuts set the target to 900Yes.It’s been beat up not a long term hold but it’s definitely going to have a run up before earnings 🤷🏽‍♂️Bullish?OuchEhhhhhh I like where your heads at  but maybe make it 20?Same, my whole account is almost tied up now. I’m in SPY, ARKG, ARKK, AMD, NVDA, SQ. Figured most of them had enough of a dip to get in, just need to wait for the recovery now and hope there’s not some crazy correctionYour profit will be

Why don’t you take your soy latte and go cry somewhere else nobody here gives a shit about your feelings pussy.Damn better suck away all my bad moves for that priceoh so you make the rules now ?Same 

Those TSLA calls really clutched it out last year 😍😍😍I hold TSLA since 2017 already cashed out at 880, I don't give a shit rather it crash since it will never affect me. Unlike you I'm not in the red, good luck to your foreclosure.It's definitely a long hold, I also bought tons more Monday when it opened -25%YepRight, but now that this happened, amazon is going to have to be even stricter about their services. And apple, googl, etc. tbis all happened right in front of their eyes and they didn’t do anything about until enough people complained. 

This’ll push stronger regulations from each of them, and most likely some legislation to hold them accountable (230), which still fucks them Long term.

Which means more censorship! Nice work libs!Very low volume after hours don’t even look at itNot anymore he aintLol.  What a legend.Whats your contract price?Bag holding some 1/15 30C maybe I'll get $25I gave up on it and went with NGA this morning. Probably won't do another ETF for a while.Since 5am 😎I’m building a startup, and sneaking in 2 hrs of trading...grow a pairMight not even be enough when they start buying the dip it’ll hit ATH by Friday2/19😂Cross your fingers and hope Biden helps you out tomorrow.APHA/TLRY these 2 companies are merging 

CGC
CRLBF
CCHWF
GTBIF
MSOS

These are just a few, but I would wait to get in. I feel
They will consolidate in the next few weeks. Now APHA/TLRY merger is supposed close in Q2 March/April tike frame. This will create largest Cannabis company in the world. They have a deal with Anheuser Busch INV (BUD).Big established Canadian companies that are going to absolutely devour the patchwork of state business once US goes federally legal. 

EV, weed, stable government. Look at me. Democrats are money now. Thanks Buyden very cool.*Monkey's paw curls.*You musta bought stupid ass callsThey had a public offering not too long ago, which usually means down - but like TSLA did BLNK shot up on they’re public offering, they went from 41-50; profit taking one day and now they are set to take off againno they're afraid Fed will change interest rates based in rising inflationI too wonder about this contradiction every time it gets raised.I doubt itDamn... in comparison they are just damn near free.YesI’m a retard too but I don’t think thats how it works, if you sell OTM call, you have to buy back to close the position. 

Say you sold a $30 call for $0.25, while the price is $20. Say the price rose to $29 bringing the option closer to the money, because you’re short the $30 call to close you’d buy that contract back. In this scenario, you’d buy back for $1.00 for a loss of $0.75. 

Id look at credit spreads.Stay strong brother sending love, i only do shares now been burned too many timesIn that case then goev

Apple already passed up on them and that says somethingFair enough, but it’s gonna keep going up. Slowly, but it’s gonna keep going.That’s in the sequel!Sold all my 60c yesterday for 50% gains. Still have my 55c leaps and June calls left. Hope it'll reach $60I sold at the bottom today I love myselfJust bought 17k worth of apha sharesStop!Money should be available to trade immediately, but to fully process will take longerBtfdif only we were allowed to change our usernameslol

It ain't no fun that muchCan’t tell if you’re being serious but if so you’re gonna die so you should probably do something about it. I was in a similar but not nearly as bad situation as yours and went back to therapy and that helped a lot. Maybe think about doing the same thing.I’m happy to hear that. Keep trying - you can do it.You should read more on what you invest in so you know why it’s a good investment. I watched people buy buy buy and then panic all in 12 hours while the market wasn’t even open. It’s extremely telling of people’s intelligence. Doesn’t matter, I read. GOEV will be everywhere in 5 years.I don’t see it?WestMara is solid as long as corn is above 27k.Should have put “ “ around it. 😂This aged wellWell also consider GME recently was trading at 1x earnings.It’s true they’re closing stores but lots of retailers are downsizing unprofitable sites.  It’ll take revenue down but improve profitabilityI have a 1/22 790p. Need to get out of it this week obviously. Just not sure if today or tomorrow.r/wooshGo fuck off to r/conservative ya skyward bound twatThanks 😆oh ok. You have to realize that American moms and people who like buying physical games/used games will still to go GameStop for its convenience and popularity. If I wanted a pre-owned game I'd go to GameStop rightaway to save a few bucks. Also gamestop is now focusing more on digital e-commerce and now with Ryan Cohen and other two former members of Chewy joining in the future looks bright for GME. Just find GME in /r/wsb and you'll see a ton of infoStrangers showing up at your door and then haggling at the last minute?

NahLmfao the equivalent of my pp is bigger than your pp. Fucking 🤡I dunno, I'm bored🧐I have a bridge to sell you.I don't know what that has to do with anything.😂 I didn't get enough butt action 🥺All the best with it! Big props for starting so early.yea i have calls only on 4 stocks, all high volume. i put 30k total into my robinhood and am not gonna add any more. and don’t worry about that, robinhood has its flaws but if you have nice gains and wanna transfer them to your bank account or to your schwab account you’ll be fine (if you wanna transfer positions to schwab you’ll have to pay a fee of 75 bucks, transferring cash is no fee though)I’m just saying...that’s a pretty good reason to be red lmaoI would say 100 is unrealistic but a 15 percent jump in the first 30 mins is pretty solidHe “bought the dip”I’m sorry you’re holding so many bags you have to lie like that

I know the people at Stripe and they say hi but not a chance in hellStripe is a 50B co. No fucking way they get SPACd.Lmao my bad, I wasn’t sure if I made that clear or not from the original postOne of my only qualitiesYea I’ve got a 3x long Tesla ETF currently bleeding me dry because of course I bought the day before NIO day. Holding it long term thoughhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwera5/jimmy_boy_might_be_pickup_up_the_gme_story/PLTR is dead and downgraded. Go check our Cramers Twitter.

Obviously I did my DD.I dont think it’s a private corporations job to educate the people on social injustice. It’s a nice gesture but it benefits them more than anything. It’s marketing money well spent. Look at us talking about it.


What I mean is, it’s a calculated investment, not a gift. If they really wanted to make a change, it would cost much more. But it’s not their job to solve this issueYes daddyAnd you good sir!man - I guarantee the same people posting on those subs are the ones posting on this one at my work. I swear its that weird group that just do it to try and one up each other and humble brag. its fucking bizarrelol someone at least just called him out on the message board and said what he is saying is complete BSthat's my favorite way 2 tradeAm unloading my leaps today on this piece of junk..... and buy back only during then I guessYeah there are condos here. I'm not from here tho so i just use the terminology i'm familiar withDidn’t even notice he commented lmao. Yeah, it’s weird that they have their own community.Thanks for an honest answer, I agree with you. I’m holding for the long term. The more I read on GME the more I believe that this is a long term hold rather than looking to profit from the short squeezeIt all makes sense now. You’re envious because you can’t afford TSLA, so you’re banking on a hard tank with your cheap puts. Got it. 🤡We live good lives ? 

We are forced to go to work, while our government tries to keep us from interacting in our free time. 

We are wage slaves.Bro, that’s a gem. She’s so slutty yet classy at the same time. Good lookin out 🙏I literally just imagined her jumping out of a birthday cake butt naked and crawling on all fours telling me she wants Daddy’s birthday loadTo be fair 1/22 is so next Friday. Easy mistake.at first glance, yes...if you're an apple investor it's brilliantProof or gtfoI actually quite like my Xbox tbhI wanna know who was the dumbass that hyped up this bullshitWow how stupidOh shit I thought you were ragging from when I posted that ACI was a good buy-in right now haha. Glad to see someone else sees long term potential for it.Definitely not holding through ERI’m so sorry. There’s too many retards who don’t understand and won’t go down to see it in the thread so I’ve been pasting it. Realized that’s probably spammy. Thanks for letting me knowStill a majority. Still able to control the rules in the Senate. Still able to control the legislative agenda.  You’re downplaying the significance of all this. Agree about Manchin and moderates.yeah lets create a prayer circle for the stimmy talks tomorrow to send TSLA to the moonso what were you saying?Order book is completely manipulated. The float and trade volume is tiny so it’s super easy to move the price. Most of this run has been short squeeze.Well they better fucking mine faster and the stock better be < 21 by March, otherwise I’m toast. Go children gooooooooooooooooTrue but doesn’t change the point as the banks still get approximately the same cutSome were thinking it’d be a vaccination announcement.

So it may move up just because they aren’t passing out free vaccines at their stores. 🤷‍♂️

But not a price moving announcement.Sure. Let's hope it's trying to go upHoping for mass death and imperialism is super coolCool story broFound TrumpTV’s first customer[deleted]But that's not what it closed at like you said...What do you think about $30 1/21/2022 

Only $201 each....

Part of me even thinks that’s not being greedy enough due to the merger and if any sort of legalization happens I think it’ll truly fly

Canadas legalization soared it to $300 somehow in 2018Bro it literally says legalize comedy it ain’t the deepBecause of that it'll hit 40 EOW 😂So the short squeeze is next week ? Or todayYo we gonna moon today ?FUCKAll on green. Cuz I have ballsI agree. My calls are for april so ill be fine. It was just more aesthetically pleasing to see a slow gain rather than a huge jump and pullback. 

Im also pissed at this GME cult vindication going on right now. This sub will be 100% GME memes by 1pmwell when ya don't short by calling the top yeah it's pretty easy

You wait for the bulls to break down firstIndeed. A dude paid me probably $200 by himself just to send selfies in my boxer briefs 😁Ahh got it 👍thank you for taking the time to help and have a great week aheadYeah I’m not too sure right now . Guess will see next few days. Makes me mad Xpev and LI pumped so hard yesterday and we fell redOk, thanks.By feb 19 puts on feb 5 and then the same dates in mayThere’s a SPAC etc#THERES A SPAC ETFS P C XSPAKGMEOuch?Yea I’m thinking $20 is more reasonable.No no, LEAPS are a big part of my strategy for a while now.. i just went way too big selling premium on FCEL.. i sold 11 strike calls just after Xmas, and you can obviously see how far that's went against me but i was able to meet margin requirement up until now.. just the way she goes i guess.. but i bought PLUG puts yesterday with what was left.Doubt it bruh. MAGAts can't flyGotcha, thanks. You think it's still worth buying calls at open today?What would I see?I'm very aware of the shelf offering. On the call they said they have no intentions of using it, only if its a dire situation.No but I don’t think you can continue to collect UI from the job you lost if you’re “willing & able to work” the same job again.ok callout will be in Vegas first to make sure that shit ignites.I have bought shares.  Been buying up shares in my fidelity account.  I am using RH to learn options.Lol you’re so hurt. What a nerd 😂we are the captain nowOh fuck off. There are 20 comments saying the same thing, go cry elsewhere.I also made a shitton of tsla. Just highlighting that nothing matters anymore.Cashed out at exactly the top.. sureI got MARA and NIO stocked long, aiming for Pluto, just gotta buy the dipWow, you are just out of touch with reality.  But either way, PARLER is fucked, as I said.  Which is a huge positive for the world.  You say censorship, the majority of people say: "not allowing you to commit crimes".  Freedom of speech, does not include violence towards others or the removal of their rights as you right-wing nuts seem to think is fine.

Because lets face it, only the dumbest, most impotent, losers embrace conservative policy (with the caveat that there are a few very rich creeps who enjoy stealing from you clowns).hell ya. big gains incomingDon't forget to tip us off insider style when your startup makes an agreement to go public via SPACI’m not even trading ICLN. RH shows calls down on a 1%+ yesterdaylooks like a cup and handle on the daily.. handle hasn’t formed yet. potential downward before breakoutOhh but there is no way they fed would raise rates right now. That would be insaneYou have to weigh the risks tooNo, a call is a right to buy 100 shares at a certain price. So imagine I have 100 shares of a company X, and I sell a call for 200 bucks at a strike of 30 and X is trading at 20 right now. If X is at 35 by the time the call expires, I have to sell my shares of X at a price of 30. I lose out on the 500 I would’ve gotten if I didn’t sell the call, but I also gain the 200 premium, and I gain the 1,000 from X going from 20 to 30but the burn hurts so goodhopefully it does, it'll be a sad day if/ when all of the original U.S automakers go out of business for goodI'm holding 50c for May that I bought last summer. Also 60c leaps and ERX sharesMe too. At least I was still up $200fuck lol[deleted][deleted]Nothing that’s why there’s a sell off right nowNot for this sub, no. But then I’d have to assume that means the momentum is on big NGA. 

Assume means hope, right?You’re not wrong. PM this morning was a huge mislead. Looks like we’re gonna see GME continue it’s rise to power, plug will eat it for today, and Tesla well Tesla just needs to break 860 and then that’ll stop being flatRight on.  I reallocated my IRA to very similar, but want to up the exposure to these, particularly ICLN.  Appreciate it.I bought Feb callsThanks broOnly one dreaming is idiot buying GME; a company with no future.It was excellent. Bought Jan 15 $63 puts for 1.55 and sold for 2.00. Easy money. 
Now back to watching my GME gains. Fucking idiot can obviously tell your new.Closing stores = desperate for money and everyone like digital more now, trend will only continue with thing like xbox game pass, anyone who know videogame industry understand thisNah I’ll stay here and piss off your kind some more.You literally brought up the age of my account lol

Sorry I’m more liked than youBRING ON THE STRONG VHe deffo FOMOed at the topi agree, to hype this up definitely makes it weird. But the reaction on here is beyond APPL, which is why i'm a lil peeved.It's just depressing seeing people bragging about their shit investments thinking they're some sort of fucking genius when if they'd YOLO'd into TSLA they could have probably quadrupled their investment 😂Yeah it's a tough call. We've been range-bound for ages now. Who knows what will happen once insiders can sell at will. I think institutions will snap the shares up tho.Right lol.. ‘round here you rent apartments, buy condos / townhouses etc.. where do you “buy” apartments?In that case, thank you for your service.There’s just something about that half awake no makeup hungover I just got fucked all night look she gives. And the innuendos omgAh! Sorry man. Not trying to blast yah over it.All you can expect Biden to do is agree to another climate deal that's not even binding for us unless Congress ratifies it (which they won't do) and to do whatever he can within the powers of the executive branch. This means he'd decrease the supply of oil & gas, which will make the price go up. He has expressed some interest in a version of cash for clunkers. That's as much as we can expect him to get through this Congress. Meanwhile, expect big increases in oil and gas consumption across Asia. 

I expect the price of XOM to rise in the intermediate future so that the dividend yield isn't so out of whack. Eventually the stock price will put the yield somewhere in the 4% ballpark. This, and not some lottery ticket, was was where I put most of my 2020 investing money in. I have almost 2,500 shares. I also bought a decent amount of Big Tobacco and a small number of other blue chips. The only long term meme stock I'm holding is PLTR, just 185 shares. 

My focus for 2021 is Altria and PM. I'd like to get my tobacco holdings up to around where my XOM holdings are.I’m in, but I wasn’t planning on holding into tomorrow.Lol you’re bagging about 2%? Wasn’t this turd at $30 a couple months ago?You got puts? I got a 1/29 165p when it was at 195-196 yesterday. We’ll see.Cope more, I said that every recession/depression since WO2  has been "solved" with war. 

If this is too real for you get an ETF and fuck off.That’s not wokeYou don’t understand what woke means. Or you are trolling. Either way you’ll find out soon enough when Wakanda starts to control everything.There’s no doubt at all that it will fly if it gets legalized. That’s the part that we’re gambling with. No legs no jump, and probably just a steady decline forever. 

Personally I’m doing $15 1/21/22

More expensive, little safer, but also let’s me cash out for profits easier in the short term if I’m wanting access to more money for some reasonI’m not even going deep!

Its a cancel culture reference. Probably more specifically to the pronoun memes he sent out.What the fuckNot complaining as the other half of my portfolio exists out of XPEV 😅 but it sucks after the great announcements that they have made on NIO day, which for me was higher than my anticipation.Spac elfOh my god we’re all billionairesMy shares of MARAI prefer 15 to be on the cautious side but I woulda fired off on the 16-17 calls as wellFCEL was really fun selling puts on for a while but I’m glad I didn’t get assigned tbhI would love to be wrong in this case!No idea. I'm not putting any more into this one personally. Might still go up though its a relatively small cap co.Well a vaccine isn’t the end all be all to protection against Covid anyway. I’d still be worried of catching it if I had a respiratory issue like asthma. I say go for the vaccine. You can still be wary of returning to work with a vaccineOh lovely, I’ll dm ya real quickWhy i get da bootNah I really just want you to leave the board and not come back. Try r/politics those are your people.you're the one crying fuckin retard. go back and read your cry baby comments. you big fuckin cry baby baby. WAHHH I MAKE BAD DECISIONS WAHHHHHH WHAHHHHH WAHHHHHHREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIt’s interesting that dems want unity and look at the response I get. “Out of touch with reality”. “Dumb impotent loser”. “Clowns”. The most hypocritical party of all time. 

What’s even more funny because I’m anti-censorship I’m “right wing”   How about considering I voted for Joe biden because trumps a dumbass?  

Point is that It’s a slippery slope to start censoring. If you don’t think it’s dangerous when big tech controls the narrative, I have a bridge to sell you.Lol !  But actually a good idea to let this group of geniuses & retards knowOne of the holdings did poorly, 1% is nothing on options when I tripled my account last week YOLOing on themOh nvm crayons do whatever you do broOk, I’d try that strategy out on a paper trading account first. Let me know how it goes.

Edit: I just realized you’re talking about covered calls, in which you are correct. I thought you were talking about selling naked calls because I naturally believe everyone on this sub is as poor as me.You sure proved me wrong bud, great comeback and everything.

Back to twitter cupcake :xPeople making credible threats of violence is an arrestable offence. And no, you're right, we definitely do not have the technology to track people down from their Internet activity.

Fuck me you're dense. You truly belong here.No it just means NGA holders are kind of desperate for retail buys rather than having news that adds momentum/excitement without spam begging on another ticker.Good luck my guyJust buy shares then and watch them climb all yearBeing a 🌈GME🐻 is gonna be bad for your health retard. I wouldn't bet against Ryan CohenLmfao 🤡🤡🤡Do you think the leaps is worth holding? I got in at $8 for a 2023 45C. 

They keep getting good news n new contract but keeps getting downgraded wtfI grew up in Japan, where you buy apartmentsDidn’t think you were lol. I wasn’t trying to grief you either. I just actually reviews a bunch of ICLN holding and was like damn. Less of a US etf then I thought. I think a lot of people are expecting a huge pump on ICLN in the coming days. I would love that, but I think it will be more subtleI’m short shares and long puts and got absolutely annihilated yesterday. I’m considering just closing everything and coming back closer to March 9 which is when lockup period ends and all the private investors can sell. I have a buddy who works there as a low level sales rep and he’s a multi millionaire I have to imagine a lot of them will be selling first chance they get.[deleted][deleted]What’s that?Yeah well i would have been up 15K instead of down 60K if i sold puts instead of fucking calls.. man. This shit will not stop rallying.Yeah I might as well, I doubt I’ll even be able to get it before my UI expires in March anyway so it will probably be good timingdunnoI guess your mom didn’t put enough vanilla extract in your pancakes this morning. It’s okay your obese ass will survive 😂>reeeeeeeeeYou are getting that after calling the "other side" tards and threatening them.  *Shocked face*

"Why does no one like me when I mistreat them constantly and abuse others and promote violence and want to take away everybody's basic human rights?"

DUuuuuuuuurrrrrrrthat’s not what I’m saying. April calls up only 2% when icln up 1% eodNot going near that autistic thing, I just know it's retarded and playing with fireMy gut says hold. But ngl, the downgrades make me think shit i dunno.Right. The amount of people who jumped into this play have zero understanding of what a ETF is and how it works. Well get a pump but in reality I’m expecting this to be at 60-70 by 2022. Using this has my main investment while I roll FDs on meme stocksWoke is social justice warrior/racial equity bullshit not being mad your guy didn’t win the electionMmmmmk simp.There’s a SPAC elfOof I saw a recovery play from SRPT at the beginning of this week if it’s not too late I would get in MAR19 100c or just some shares atleast.Understandable, have a nice dayS'alright. I didn't even get a ban notification, I just noticed one day I got boxed out. No biggy.And in classic dem fashion, you ignore my point. Not sure where I called you a “tard” or threatened you, but okay. 

Good luck to you, make sure you wear your helmet!Buy some puts after the surge then motherfucker. You won'tThanks buddy I think imma hold and average down. Long term outlook for this company does look q juicy though but idk man.... this is insane.... would they ever go up....!What?Prob do GILD and BABA.I addressed your "point".  Noone likes you because you want to mistreat them all.  You call them names.

You can't even read your own writing?

Sounds like you got issues.  Here, have some tissues child. Did that help make it better?

No, well, that's rough.  Maybe you will learn from your experience and try treating others slightly better instead of clinging to an ideology of hate.  

Otherwise, we will have to step in and continue to be the "bad guys", enforcing consequences to your negative actions.

You poor little thing.I like the GILD idea, not sure how I still feel on babaI never called you a tard nor threatened you. Go back and read.

You clearly want big tech to think for you instead of thinking for yourself. That’s hilarious. 

We’re done here.Well if you're feeling fear then that's prob the ultimate buy signal..Go for it brothaRobinhood: "iNviTe A fRiEnD gEt A fReE sHaRe LiKe ApPlE oR fAcEbOoK"

Anyways thanks for the free Google share or whatever.For the noobies, PLUG was a banned ticker on WSB 1 year ago and if you talked about it you were labeled a “shill” or “pump and dump” 🤡Just got a message that I was permanently banned from r/personalfinance for posting about the ETFs: ICLN, ARKG, ARKK, LIT

The post I commented under was asking about advice on which ETFs they should add to their portfolio, and so I recommend some of the ones that I have in my portfolio. The mods mentioned that I was “trolling” and broke a rule that apparently does not allow people to post about either of those ETFs. 

I was genuinely trying to help. What the fuck.My father died today.

Twice, you're probably really annoyed. But to have it happen again and again, shit is fucking exhausting. Been trading for years and while I'm happy to see a lot of you make a killing, I'm starting to think whether something like that will ever happen to me.

Genius.My father was a retard, my grandfather was retard, and I am also a retard.**How much $20,000 invested in SPY at the bottom in March is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 1/15/21 $300** strike calls was **2.07**. Lets say we used $20k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

SPY 1/15 $300 calls at the ask price of 78.78 which gives us a total value of:

[https://imgur.com/a/NrC5JJE](https://imgur.com/a/NrC5JJE) 

ICLN had a 'golden cross' moment (my first green arrow from left to right: 7EMA passing 100EMA). As soon as this occurred, there was an influx in volume (400K volume) spike, mostly options driven. Of those options, 73% were bulls (calls) and 27% were bears (puts). Majority lead, bulls. The average price target on options was at a $1.98 above it's current trading value which is $32.34, which puts the majority of the bullish call options around a \~$34 call. As a result, the relative strength index (bottom green arrow) has been tapering around 65%. This indicates potential further upwards momentum. And for those who didn't read this... here are some rockets.  🚀🚀🚀  TLDR: $ICLN Call options in April/July at $34C will print, anticipate the ticker to hit a $34C by Friday post-Biden announcement. CheersI feel like everyone here is balls deep in ICLN lolLol I remember when I thought in order to “fit in” in this sub I had to have a ton of money in my portfolioEveryone still on here needs to go to bedCan't sleep again. PLTR to the moon by EOY 🚀🚀🚀I'm gonna get rich off tsla one way or another through FDs or jumping in front of a moving tsla. 🤣😂When my grandkids ask what I did during the pandemic, I will never mention I spent the whole time playing video games and shitposting in online forums.Fuck I forgot how shit it is coming on here before open when the fucking bears are still sniffing around trynna spread a bit of fear*Buy high, and sell low?

# 😒Some financial advisor reached out to me via LinkedIn alumni network looking for clients. Gonna tell him my net worth is already locked up in TSLA derivatives.Since I started frequenting WSB, the rest of Reddit has become incredibly...bleh, more so than it already was. It's not the whole "too PC" thing either, which I honestly don't care about at all, but people here just take themselves so much less seriously -- it's so refreshing and fun to be a part of.

Anyway, PLTR $28 EoW.ICLN gap up tomorrowAny insights on the Wendy's work from home policy?

1. A deal and investment with Hyundai.

2. Other yet unannounced partnerships.

3. Proven technology platform that can be used by any manufacturer to quickly build EV models.

4. Based in California for all the sweet EV government money.

> THIS IS THE MOTHER OF ALL BUBBLES

Someone call patrick star in here, he can stretch a bubble like a mofoJust late night thoughts... I don’t post much on Reddit but I was thinking VALE is probably going to the moon.

My thought process behind it is Apple is working on a EV. Tesla is dominating the market with EV. Nickel will be in super high demand but the main point is VALE strive on being an eco friendly mining company. Which Apple and Tesla both push for being eco friendly in their companies. If Apple works with another manufacturer they are going to make sure that they play by apples rules. Apple rules mean eco friendly no matter what. Just like removing all charging bricks from phones watch’s and even there wireless chargers. 

So to summarize Apple and Tesla will both need nickel for there cars and VALE is a cleaner mining company. VALE to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Otherwise wtf am I doing in ICLNIf apple announces its comitting to 100% green energy by 2050 ima plaster cum on my phoneTim Apple the type of dude that will announce he is gonna Cuck the ZuckApple tried to buy Canoo and they told them to fuck off  😂😂😂My daily PSA (reminder) for QQQJ
---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes upl gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies report blowout Q4 earnings and give super optimistic guidance for 2021. However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. 

Have a nice rest of the evening folks!

$35c June is the most liquid strike and expiration.I just want Cathie to tuck me in and read me a bed time story.

Calls on APPLNice I gambled away all my money and have nothing left to pay for college

Was good knowing youPresident Biden, with the help of a Democrat-controlled House + Senate, will pump $2.4 trillion into the sector during 2021. My prediction is that sometime in the next 5 years, **ICLN** will cost $300+ per share (maybe more). Getting it now is still an absolute steal. Get in now before the real pump happens. This is once in a lifetime opportunity, we haven't seen an infrastructure change like this since the industrial revolution. The dam has broken, and smart money, even oil companies such as Shell and BP, have already started pouring funds into the clean energy sector.

The energy sector is about to turn upside down and clean energy will be the only way to power anything by 2035.

**ICLN** GANG WYA??!!Anyone else do 8 hours of DD then throw it out the window at open?Plug and FCEL doing hulk dick things but ICLN only up 1.1%?

AAPL 420c 1/15The Wall Street Journal online comment section might be the most boomery place in the history of the universe.  Boomers, boomers everywhere! Here is a legit excerpt from our friend David S.:

>I'd rather own Berkshire, and get solid returns over the next 25 years, with minimal risk allowing me to sleep at night, versus something like NIO which could go up 100% the next few years, or very possibly go back down to $10 or so... Young people chasing these high flying EV stocks haven't experienced the pain of the dot com bubble.  And they don't have families to support yet, so "preservation of capital" is not top of mind for them.  They will eventually learn.Bought 25k in PLUG puts 10 minutes before close. I'll post the loss porn tomorrow.#Aight boys

I’ve been shilling ICLN here for a week or so and we’ve made some fat racks, now ima tell you about a ticker just like PLUG.

The chart on this grade-A fuckable stock looks just like PLUG, and the best part is the ticker.

Boomers kicking our millenial asses boys.Little insider info here for you guys. I'm renewing my Amazon Prime subscription this week.BABA Service Announcement: I speak for all WSB when I say that I legit hope Jack Ma and his family are okay. WSB looks at China solely as a money making opportunity and joke about the CCP and its authoritarianism from time to time, but what's never mentioned is that Jack Ma is a free market capitalist and seemingly a decent person so I hope Jack and his family can get the fuck out of China and move to America and innovate and create jobs here.

> While Canoo now has the money it sought at the beginning of 2020, that hasn’t softened its ambitions to work with big companies like Apple. The startup said in that same SEC filing that it is “currently in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging Canoo’s technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.” 

My reading of this article is that previous Apple talks fell apart, not that current/future ones are off the table.Apple was willing to buy Canoo, and the executives/board had the confidence in their company to reject the acquisition. Now, months later, they got a partnership with Hyundai and coincidentally Apple is partnering with Hyundai too.So much apple news so little apple tendiesCanoo gang, idk what the fuck happened, but we're waking up on the moon tomorrowAAPL pls flyAnother day, another EV SPAC popping off in my accountI would give my left nut for a massively Green Day tomorrow.🛶🛶🛶 my Canoo calls printing tomorrow!!!

When his next SPAC is announced for either IPOD/IPOF, sell once the stock exceeds 50% gains at opening (calls w/ 500% gain), or exercise your calls if you're a LT investor (which I know none of you degenerates are).

Always have been.#WE SMOKING ON THAT BEAR PACK 🚬👌😎😤😤😤😤Here’s my secret sauce for cooking up tendies. 

Do scan for stonks hitting 20 day high. Buy calls. Set a stop 1 standard deviation (I use ATR) below price. Add to position on the way up. Hold/add until it makes a 10 day low.

Pretty much buy high sell low as opposed to buy low and hope.

You'd have to be literally mental to be a bear right now“Based on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax reporting rules, TD Ameritrade generates and sends IRS Consolidated Form 1099s to our clients whose accounts during the previous tax year had:

Population of India = 1.366 billion
Population of China = 1.398 billion
World population = 7.794 billion

Total market of India and China represent 35% of the world's population. 

Therefore, TSLA valuation deserves 35% of the world's total money supply which is $80.9 trillion according to [Business Insider ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/all-of-worlds-money-in-one-chart-2015-12%3famp). This roughly translates to about $30,000 per share.

Apple and Amazon have merged into the entity known simply as "A" and run the entire planet. They defeated Google in the Great Monopoly Wars of 2050 with the help of AWS AI, which could not be outcomputed.

Cars are known as Canoos now, but not because the world is flooded. The company grew quickly in the archaic 2020s to dominate the industry and eventually lobbied successfully to ban other manufacturers for being inferior.Had 40k net worth a year ago. Been driving a 08 Volvo XC90 I paid 9k outright for 5 years ago. I’m 26 now and Currently at 400k (my ATH), and I make about 90k a year. I told myself I would never buy a new car, I used to be frugal, but now the market has desensitized me to money. BUT now I really wanna buy a 2021 4Runner TRD OFF-ROAD and mod the fuck out of it. Should i fucking do it? Or someone talk me out of it. Or talk me into it. Just got a 45k loan approved at 2.19% 60 months. Could pay it off anytime but wanna keep my tendies in the market.I add lmao to the end of everything I type to remove any sort of seriousness even if I'm pouring my heart out and I mean what I say lmaoOn the year, ICLN is outperforming ARKK 🤷🏽‍♂️I’m just chilling. I’m drinking a beer. Looking at all the plug calls that I’ve sold in the past that expire next month. I’m not going to rope. I promiseso people are really paying celebrities on Cameo to shill penny stocks and it’s actually working?

Issuer:  Affirm Holdings, Inc.

Offering:  Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO

The registration statement for Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO WILL NOT be declared effective and the offering priced this evening, 01/12/2021.  Therefore Personal Investments (PI) has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering for the following reasons: 

PI is required by the SEC to obtain confirmations on indications of interest after effectiveness but before secondary market trading in Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO begins.  The Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering is NOW expected to be declared effective tomorrow morning, 01/13/2021 and trading in the secondary market will begin immediately afterwards.  As a result, there would be insufficient amount of time for PI to obtain customer confirmations and complete the allocation process prior to the security's trading in the secondary market.  Therefore, PI has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering.

Ingredients:

2 cups all purpose flour

2 tablespoons baking powder

1 teaspoon kosher salt

3 tablespoons light brown sugar

2 eggs

1 teaspoon vanilla

1 1/2 cups milk

5 tablespoons butter, melted

2 cups fresh blueberries

butter for frying

Instructions:

1.	⁠In a large bowl whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and brown sugar together.
2.	⁠In separate bowl whisk the eggs, vanilla and milk together.
3.	⁠Add the wet ingredients into the dry and mix until just combined. Lastly mix in the melted butter and stir until combined, the batter will be slightly lumpy.
4.	⁠Set the batter aside while you heat your griddle to medium-low heat. Melt a small pat of butter on the griddle and then scoop out 1/4 cup of pancake batter onto the hot griddle and top evenly with blueberries, as many or few as you prefer.
5.	⁠Cook until the edges are set and bubbles form on top of the pancake. Flip and cook until browned. Serve warm.🥭 TOLD PENCE ON JAN 6 : "YOU CAN EITHER GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS A PATRIOT OR YOU CAN GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS A PUSSY"Tesla price tmrw at open boys? 900$?Just rewatched Big Short.

So when everyone human is born is given a random amount of "years" to live. To extend your life you can take it or transfer it from other people. So the world has rendered money useless and instead people use their "time" as a form of currency. So if you want a coffee well that cost a minute of your life. And your wages are paid in extra time. So in the stock market we can gamble our time and to actually YOLO you can literally die or become immortal.Why are you retards awake?holy shit GOEV 👀Giant green dildo on ICLN 🤑🤑🤑My retired mom bought TSLA shares in the March dip because she heard about it from her boomer friends. Obviously she's up a lot, so she started getting interest in TSLA and decided to sell her paid-off car and buy a Tesla car. Cool, it's her money and she's buying a cool car. The problem is, she called me this morning and told me she ordered a Model S and because she's not using a gas car anymore, she ordered the Tesla solar roof thing, the battery pack, and the Tesla wall charger. She basically dropped $100k on Tesla products because she's up a bit on the stocks. Not only that, when I went to her house to talk to her after the call, I found a poster of Elon Musk hung up next to my dead dad's ashes.

I've seen very few stocks be able to maintain any upwards momentum when they get that stretched. There will be at least one fat red daily candle for you to profit off of. Just have to get out once you get that red day or two, don't baghold.

Part of the reason why this works is because 90 on the daily is just crazytown. TSLA has only managed it once or twice.

At pixel time, the French car company’s shares are up 1.5 per cent to €36.80 on the news. That gives it a valuation of just under €11bn.
Yet in early trading, Plug Power’s share price is up 17 per cent to $62.36, giving it a market capitalisation of $30bn. Yes, that’s billion with a ‘B’.
So, in short, the press release caused the market to forecast that the discounted value of Plug Power’s future cash flows from this joint-venture agreement will be worth almost exactly a third of Renault’s market value (which, as a reminder, is the discounted value of its total future cash flows).

If I buy a call option and the contract goes up in value and then I sell it before expiration, do I then owe the person I sold the option to the underlying shares at expiration if it’s above the strike price? Or is that the person who originally sold me the options contract? 

I’m tempted to trade options once I’m 18 but I really don’t want to be one of those guys who goes into negative balance cos they had no idea what they were doing.

Find a stock you wouldn't mind owning that is a good value. Dividend stocks are bad for this.

Buy a call and sell a put. Both at the money. Total cost $0. Have the put be cash secured. If the stock goes up, sell some of the calls (not all) and all of the puts. Now you have all the upside of calls and no downside. You can move on to the next stock and repeat.

If it goes down you will just end up owning the stock.

There are so many missing commas in this thread. So little correct punctuation, capitalization, etc.

Anyways, SPY to 385 EoW.Oh my god GOEV after hours I am going to fucking cumI honestly think Tesla will hit 900 EOW but definitely 870 tomorrow we tested it today but didn’t have the trading volume to past itIsn’t GME’s ultimate game plan entirely like Blockbusters? Blockbuster realized it was losing market share and copied Redbox and tried to get video on-demand but was too late and died. Coronavirus + new console was saving grace for GME but let’s be honest — you didn’t try to get that PS5 at GameStop. You first tried Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart before succumbing and standing in line with the neckbeards who sell new releases back for under the going eBay price. 

I know you all are only here for the short squeeze but I get a bad feeling about investing certainties. Something tells me your timing will be off and theta and IV will screw you. Well, good luck then.AOC is life rn 👀

More riots like the last one and will cause even more unrest. Just let trump leave the office peacefully so biden can pump my tsla calls with his stimulus package[removed]You idiots who think the article is bad for GOEV. It’s good for them. It shows that they were talking way beforehand, and now that Hyundai has come in picture, GOEV can easily partner with Apple. Retards think just because the talk failed in early 2020 that GOEV cannot partner with AAPL in the future. 🤡twitter:

Personally, I don’t buy anything above 80% IV, except TSLA maybe.Say I put in an order to buy 5 call contracts (all at the same date/price) and it immediately goes through.  A couple hours later, I sell those same 5 contracts and they're all 5 sold at once.  Did I just make one day-trade or five?Where can I buy GOEV short shorts 😂So is apple doing their announcement through an interview on CBS this morning?any thoughts on $dash?My friend in UK works for an agency that books flights and accommodation for car companies sent me photos of a NEO sponsored E-Grand Prix car prototype, and says after 3 years their planning on coming back this year to explore potential retail forecourt options. 👀How much longer before we can switch to shorts for a few weeks and ride this pig down?We don't deserve Plug FCELWhat’s the correct way to sell my calls at open? I’ve always just placed market order in to make sure my orders are filled right away before the sell off start but so many people have told me I need to use limit order. what if my order doesn’t go through and I end up missing all the gains?

Got 1/15 GOEV callsFUBO FUBO📈📈📈📈📈 Straight to the MOON!I use TDA, I bought a bunch of stock last Thursday.. how come it says I’m using margin on them?

Shouldn’t the trade be settled by now?[deleted]NIO can be such a disappointmentthe fuck just happenedI'm kinda retarded, but does the senate have those dem seats immediately?

I wasn't here for the first one but now Mitch the Bitch says he wants to get rid of 🥭NIO to the moon 🚀🚀🚀 Think about it.  Instead of being stuck with a sealed battery that will become shitty over time, NIO swaps out your battery in 5 minutes with a new one.  Just like wouldnt you love to have a smartphone with an easily swappable battery instead of the sealed shit they sell you now?  Maybe NIO should make smartphones too!Apples big announcement is that by 2023 half of all employees must be of color or identify as something other than male or female[deleted]Damn we had record deaths again yesterday. 4280+.

Anyone else?Def buying more GME in my IRA and taxable. I'm having visions of Ryan Cohen laying out 'Strategic Plans' during future earnings calls and its all the confirmation I need to keep buying at this price.

Bullish GME 🚀
Bearish my ability to focus at work anymore 🐻Pfizer just said they can produce 2 BILLION doses this yearI would let Cathie peg meWhen are cciv options opening?So musk donates 5m to khan academy, anyone think the huge sell off tesla saw Monday was musk liquidating some shares? We will find out soonSo the market hasn’t drilled due to expected tax increases because the market doesn’t think we will actually see tax increases? Lol sounds logical. 🤡🤡

This is also the same market that thinks we are gonna have some perfect world this year.What kinda loser opens the Reddit app and downvotes people for “fun”God just looked at GOEV. WTF! Literally bought calls today because someone said “GOEV 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀”Kimbap lowkey is just a better version of Sushi, korean food good af, Kimchi Jigae, Bulgogi, Korean fried chicken, JajangmyeonOk so futures gonna fade, rip my tesla calls. FuckWHO IS DOWNVOTING? I will find you and upvote you!Who else is gonna buy this TSLA dip tomorrow? I heard its gonna get as low as 780!Plug almost gets me going as much as AOC🤤Today’s  moves. Had a good position in plug today made best gains I’ve ever had. Decided I wanted more exposure to hydrogen so I dumped meme stock nio which I fomo into yesterday for small loss, (people on Instagram were even pumping it yesterday, the echo chamber got to me, it was like I was fucking being subliminally programmed or some shit) put that shit into bldp when it was at $34. BLDP is leader in hydro for transit, buses, trains etc and it had a news release today about  a newly secured contract. rt it’s absolutely ripping ah so seems like a good move. Otherwise after seeing some gain porn on wsb about a dude make 20k off of 200$, put some speculative money on aqms. Made a grand on eng, don’t know why it shot the fuck up, it looks like a regular engineering consultancy that will struggle to compete with arcadis and Jacobs, but it’s meme stock with a cute ticker so a lot of autists.

On the bio side tried  getting more of Dtil but spreads too wide. Speculative position on ziop. Bought $500 worth of stock in amrn don’t know why except my cash needed to be parked  somewhere.

Tomorrow... really confused about eng. will probably see if I can trade it more or something or take out a small $200 dollar position, but the max leap is like july which is disappointing. May also speculate on fuel tech, ftek, another $200 or so. But really I shouldn’t make any moves. It’s wise not to feel like you should trade every day, but I’m a retardSo extremely bullish on TSLA, we dip for one day, then we pump for a week. Today was day 1, strap inJust curious, are any of you little shits from Nashvillewould lex luthor be an incel if he wasn't mega rich?How fucked are my Apple 130 calls that expire this Friday I bought at today’s dip ?

They're probably shorting the fuck out of the stock so they can cover and deliver the shares at a minimum loss. so it's really not Melvin cucks doing all the naked short selling it's the brokerage firms purposely not delivering shares and they desert to naked short selling. idk maybe i'm just retardedOnly encouragement I needed will be yoloing for the 22ndSomeone told me to sell Plug!

* The market went overbought on Dec. 2.
* The market will remain overbought until Jan. 13, 2021.
* The Big Money Index will peak on Monday, Dec. 21, 2020, at an S&P 500 level of 3,731.56.
* The S&P 500 will peak on Jan. 18, 2021, at a level of 3,828.50.
* The S&P 500 will then subsequently fall until Monday, April 19, when it will trough at 3,341.81.

Let's see what happens.

Deadass they try so hard to play a good role in the movie, especially Gandalf (Ian Mckellian)!Guys, I think I’ve figured out what Palantir does and how they can actually expand their core products and business. I work with the network security field and to me besides business intelligence their core focus for their products is cyber security with the core product for commercial use being asset and information tracking and mapping. To me that can expand their product going one of two routes. Create APIs that also integrate with existing cyber security systems and build their data sets to also be able to analyze and track actual network analytics from the perimeter and multi site management of network security assets similar to solar winds, but also be able to build it out so network traffic from malicious entities can be tracked within the UI so notjust for hunting and locating criminals but mapping attackers, the partners in attacks of a network, and using that information to identify the location and identity of the attacker. They could even build the system out to track where malicious software originated. 

They can truly build this out and customize it in truly unique ways. It can be a platform for physical security, cyber security, or simply to asset tracking and logging as in covid. This company isn’t just building with military in mind if you think about how they can expand their existing platform to even integrate with big players like Cisco and Palo Alto with APIs.You guys gotta stop trading on emotion.

I'm up 20k this year on that alone.Bro honest advice take a month or two completely off. Don’t trade, don’t get on WSB, don’t look at the market just do other things. Come back less emotional and get ready to profit 🤘Try entering with a small position and then averaging down. Everything goes up eventually. That’s what I’m trying to do nowDo you try any momentum plays? It’s like, we all know many of these meme companies are complete crap with a few exceptions...just try to hop on and ride the train vs. doing a weeks worth of DD and missing it. 

If you’re buying tech/ev/genomics stocks lately it’s fucking easy mode. Just don’t get greedy and have an exit strategy. Sell the shit companies for short term gains and use that to buy shares of companies you believe in for the long term.What are you invested in now?Do you want a bone, or a ticker, strike price and date?If you are consistently losing Just do the opposite of what you want to doJust start inversing yourself. Looks like a shit play but retards on WSB have relatable emojis for it so they like it? Calls. Company looks like it has a lot of potential, you’ve spent hours doing DD and the company seems to be ready for take off? Puts.just take a break and start swinging/ stop weeklies/stop watching market.Dude. Buy. Fucking. Shares.Time to change strategies. Maybe your processes for choosing stocks are all wrongI don't know if this is what you're doing, but don't buy into the hype on certain stocks being hyped on WSB.  I've learned that by the time a lot of them are being hyped, they've already had a parabolic run, and are starting to level out or crater.  If everybody is talking about it, it's probably too late.Yeah man, I don’t think this is for you. Literally any tard could’ve made money this year. VTI and chill from now on?

Also I always pull any speculative profits and throw them into the main index fund account. 

You're right to be weary of the advice from people here.

CumExercise early in the morning when you wake upFeel you bro, others have already given you good advice, I would add watch some r/aww b4 bed.
And the underlying cause is probably stress, figure out why it's happening and a way to bring it down (meditation, exercise, physical activity, traveling, hell just relaxing in a hammock can help)I had 1 year of chronic insomnia in college, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. The main cause of it was initially anxiety, later on I found out when you don't sleep properly, yourbody starts to produce less and less sleep hormone and mix that with anxiety and then you created negative feedback loop of long term insomnia. Solution? Like other people said you have to replenish your sleep hormone, start taking melatonin supplements. If you want something natural, eat a banana and drink a glass of milk before you sleep. It really helps. Reverse psychology, start telling your self it's ok to not sleep instead of stress yourself out of it. They may just calm you down and help you sleep better. Also try to remove as much anxiety from your life as possible. That's the key to get your sleep back.

🧑‍🚀🔫🧑‍🚀Diamond hands here.......  ICLN Gang.950 EOWjoe manchinThe stock needs a 35% move to break even. I don't know why I keep telling people this... I'm the one selling them. Tons of iv baked in.Underwhelming green new deal? I’m long Icln though just postulatingPLEASE PLEAE DON’T YOU WILL HONESTLY LOSE A LARGR CHUNK OF YOUR MOOLA. 

Why?  It’s what I call the WSB INDICATOR.  
During any given week couple of week and if very lucky a month max.  There are a 2-4 stocks many “investors” better said degenerates including myself pile into. 

The first ones to go into the trade makes the most.  Logically they / we all advertise our positions in hope others also join. The ultimate dream is to find and sling calls on the next meme stock. 

However you can tell when it’s getting very hot and you need to sell or definitely not be the last dumbass buying at the top.   Maybe there’s still some room on ICLN however we are way closer to the beginning of a correction than a new lengthy pump.   

Scroll around and you’ll still find the poor souls asking when PLTR will pump again as they got killed and refuse to sell.   

Not saying ICLN is a bad idea, just think it’s horrible timing.  I’d also add PLUG, FCEL and even TSLA to this list.  There are sooooo many good stocks find one which gone up 20% in the last week.   

Check MSFT it’s been a dog and they are reporting at the end of the month. Without a doubt they will post fking amazing numbers.Could be making more doing something else. It’s not a bad position, but you askeddepends what exp. eft moves slowThere is none lol even dipping down today those leaps increased in value. 
PLUG & ENPH will carry ICLNPLUG is weighted at just over 8% of ICLNs holdings after today, if it pulls back we might see some red. I strongly believe ICLN is going to pump, here’s some rockets as proof 🚀🚀🚀too much moneyICLN has been artificially blaoted by retards on this sub. It may drop before it gets chugging again.

Additionally, there are other green etfs that may provide you more profit.

Think about the bigger picture. Car is depreciating asset. A toy in your case basically. I’m sure you will find better alternatives that don’t cost as much. Also, the economy is not doing well. Chances are, things will get worse down the road. Save the money and invest or buy assets that at least maintain their values in inflation.[deleted]They got the nachos taco for 1.29.

TDA shows 104.35volatility will kill you once or twice and wipe out all your gains from the weekly sells. They are covered calls so you still make some money but theres better ways to invest 13000. 

For this strategy I would look at SPY a little more money and volatile but you have 3 expirations a week so you can sell much more against it with a shorter time horizon.

You don't necessarily need to buy 100 shares for the spy strategy you can just buy a call 6-8 months out and then roll the profits into another one 6- 8 months and not let the theta catch your call if its not moving into the money enough,

I started doing this right before September crash and still broke even after the elections.Do it. AAPL moves steady enough to make good $ selling CC’sIt’s kinda shitty. At 127 I sold a Cc for $130 and only got like $100 bux for it. It ended up shooting to 132 so i ended up worse off by the time it expired.Or use the same money to buy LEAPS and sell even more CCs.

I want to add four roses to the mix tooEvan Williams bottled in bond or wild turkey 101.Best bourbon under 100$ is eagle rare. If you can find it, it’s 39$. 2nd place would be woodford reserve. You can find easily in every liquor store for 32$. 

They are both made under the Buffalo trace distillery. The same distillery which makes pappy van winkle. 

If you’re broke like most retards, then Jim beam black is 20$ and by far the best bourbon at that price point.

It’s expected to go up due to high demand and low supply around summer, so get like June calls... Anything around August should be fine. I wouldn’t get a call 2 years from now. Just my 2 cents.Safe maybe but dont 3xpect to see any return in your investment until maybe a year and a half in. It will trade sideways and fluctuate a lot until then because no one knows for sure what will happen with the stock a year and a half from now. I would strongly suggest looking at calls for April and June for VALEhttps://youtu.be/7hhQLozezakYahoo Finance, any good broker, NASDAQ appBecause there’s a lot of SPACS and some takes months, even more a year to find a target... Your money might just sit there doing nothing at all. I suggest you find a good SPAC with a team you believe in like Chamath and hold those, still no guarantees. You’ll get like 2x return from NAV on average right before merger, but a lot of plays could’ve gotten you more...

Don’t ever think about the “other” side of the party if you aren’t holding to assignment, it’s completely irrelevant.  You buy to open a call, it goes up, you sell for profit.  That’s it.  They’re basically highly leveraged shares.  

Obviously that’s an extremely simplified view.  DM me if you have other Q’s.You can only can only go negative of your original investment if you are writing calls on shares you own.Thank god you didnt make a post about it.

If you buy a contract and sell it before expiration, you shouldnt owe anyone shares. You opened a position by buying, and closed it by selling. Remember, (buy to open) and (sell to close)   


If you SELL TO OPEN, you're going to put down cash to cover (sell puts to open) or shares(sell calls to open). But if you arent SELLING TO OPEN, then you shouldnt worry about any shares/cash you have to hand over at expiration.Some investopedia and YouTube videos will be wayyy better resources for this question

Do you know whats in the mind of a young successful e-commerce billionaire in Cohen and the ex-chewy team that he's brought with him 😂? Highly doubt it mate 

E-commerce sales up over 300%

Hugely recognisable brand all over the world... I've one here in my small Irish town that's uber busy and the focal point for gaming

Roughly 500 million in cash on hand and will have a lot more with the store closures 

Hugely undervalued at 1billiin Market cap 

And to top of all the fundamentals.... Possible setup for the greatest short squeeze of all time, hence the GME gang spam here and discords full of excitement.

Even without the mother of all squeezes happening.. With Cohen at the helm.. This stock ain't a meme anymoreCohenI’m with you, just trying to figure out what could Cohen’s strategy be.  Game developers are skipping the middle man (retailers) and any future game will simply be just come as any other soft wear product and update.  

Gaming continues to grow and if there was an applicable none brick n mortar distribution model other companies such at Netflix would have pounced on it.  I just don’t see it.  He’s done great with Chewy however they sell actual physical products (just making a spread on used and new consoles isn’t sustainable specially not at that valuation).

Democrats want to rush in with a win and sentiment for legalization is at a high, with other countries and the UN lowering the schedule of marijuana.  
Also at the debate it was mentioned as a top priority to avoid police using easy racial profiling with cheap tactics.   I don’t have much invested, but I think this will have a strong push right away.

You'd be in a much better position to do slighty OTM spreads and just diamond handing those for a year if you want max gains. Not saying it can't happen but that's a lot of growth to expect for a company as large as AMZN in a yearthinking of doing this myself. but it also ties up a lot of capital and may not go up much. AMZN can go sideways for 1.5 years before gapping up if u look at its price chart that is what worries me.buy under $60I sold mine!!BanBANYou have a pool? Life ain’t all bad!ARKK,ARKGICLNBOTZPBWHACK, cyber security etfStep one: sell callsSell weekly 1000c.You mean you have $40,000 in shares and not 40,000x shares I assume. 

If you don't have 100x shares most brokers will not let you sell only partially covered. TD won't let me, it throws an error

So I hold 100x shares of TSLA and during consolidation I can make an easy $1k a week when in consolidation. When it's skyrocketing I will try to wait for the top and sell an ITM call for maximum drop protection

But right now TSLA isn't going down and I'm afraid it will rip another 8% randomly 😂It’s pretty simple, look at sell call premium and that is your answer for each date and strikeWhenever TSLA gets near a $50 or $100 mark sell ITM calls then set a bid to buy it back for $20 less

It’s bounce back a little like it always does and you get free lunch foreverWell, no, cause you need 100 shares to sell a call and you only have 40k so it's not 100read some of Gary Black's tweets about selling covered calls on TSLA. think he tends to sell ~10-15% OTM weeklies after big pops

but also, if you only have $40k in TSLA shares that isn't even 100 shares, which is what you would need to sell a single covered call.Something something too big to failall the currencies r fuk therefore none r fuk?Go read The Accidental Superpower by Peter Zeihanyes go all inThey’re making an announcement about the announcement for their next announcement[deleted]TSLA at 852, so it will be at 2852 after announcement.I wrote in 2k stimmy for president so it should be 2kplease don't teach them math rnFirst month probably 1400 next month 2k.

\-Bo BurnhamNot really, your sell call is gonna eat up a lot of premium. You would be better doing debit monthlies.I mean they do... but some bullshit like an ATM long call and slightly OTM short call is just sloowwwww fucking money.

Figure your target price, timeframe, then figure out what's maxing your leverage given those constraints. Could be a striaght-up long call, could be a spread.

Very high IV, maybe a deep OTM spread with potential for 400-500% return potential makes sense.

The shale producers are increasing rig count, but slowly and not taking on debt to do it.  The price is creeping up because the storage is drawing down because we don't have enough rigs up to maintain.  The extra profits are paying down the debt loads of Oil companies who didn't like being as leveraged as they worry after the crash.  Once it get to 60-70 a barrel they might bring the rig count back up.Uh. The market is forward looking and OPEC cutting supply.Oil is used in a lot of everyday shit.

So I said hold on a I gotta piss. She said do you wanna piss on me. This was the kinda girl where if you show even the slightest hint of indecision or lack of confidence she wouldn’t fuck you 

So I took he hand out her in the tub and pissed on her tits the came on them. She loved it. Was my first time and was wild. But the sex was insane and I thought it was weird but some of my buddies have similar stories. 

She wanted me to piss in her mouth but I didn’t do it.

Plug has 7%, do you know how many more stocks exist in the market that make up that other 93%? A ton of them and early today most weren't going up. PLUG is a meme stock it's on a different trajectory. It's just a matter of how much a stock is going up in the market at that moment and its ETF weight. That is all. No time delays, same as any other normal stock.There are these things called buyers and sellers that determine the price in the free marketAs I understand it there are weighted averages, etf share price reflects thatI would like to know as wellIt’s Thursday my fellow autist.Thought it was ThursdayPretty sure it's Thursday Jan 14its thursdayYou're obviously living in the future.

Take cuck bozzos away.Imagine thinking you were the one that told everyone about PLUG lmaoI had a chance on Friday. By some rando autist. Should of done it. At least my ICLN is doing alright. Waiting for uncle Joe to make a speech.Nothing alike.  Literally had no cares in the world in 1999.  US had no enemies (most were aware of anyway) and we were still the only super power.  Interest rates were also like 6% or some shit.  Way more optimism in general back then.Long way to go before we hit those days.  Imagine March free fall but in reverse.   Can’t wait for that to return.  This is a good ole fashion melt up in a bull market.  Stay strongOne day the dips wont bounce and bulls will give back all their money "dip buying" and then chasing their losses until you see a big fat fucking capitulation as WSB lets out a collective "Guh".Nah, Plug literally went to 1000, this is nothingSame thing happened last Feb 2020lmfao 30 to 40 hell nawLmao ford has almost 200 billion in debt.

Some fucker even said I was racist for lumping all China stocks as CCP controlled. Its a government, not a race of people. Fuck me. Vindication was so sweet yesterdayUsually 50%-100%. Let my FUBO calls ride to 150% today because it didn’t show any signs of stopping. I’ve definitely missed out on some gains by selling too early, but profit is profit & I’m up 50% on my whole portfolio since I started 3 months agoNot long50% upSell it, take the money... come back with an exit strategy next timeGenerally when I start asking myself that question.  I don't play weeklies.  I buy 3-4 months out, and if they make a bunch of money in month 2, I'm fine selling and finding another fish to catch.always try to buy more than 1 contract so you can Sell enough to make back your initial investment and then let the rest rideSell and rebuy something elseone way to hedge is to sell enough of the contracts that your initial cost basis is covered, then you're playing with house money and can let the rest ride to expirationBoth?No it looks like it will not go up for most likely the rest of the trading week and possibly into the next.

MACD : Flat on 5 min, 15min, and 30min. Downward trend MACD line coming off highs for the one hour chart, but has not entered bearish territory. 

MVWAP vs. SMA: The indicator is giving mixed signals, but is mostly pointed towards flat in the near term with the indicators crossing alot over the trading day on the 5 minute chart. On the 15 minute it does show that the MVWAP has crossed SMA which is a bearish intermediate term indicator. But on the 30 minute chart the lines have yet to cross and the price has yet to sink to test these level, which still does give us a more bullish stance. 

Volume and RSI looks to be pretty low as well and nothing exciting developing there. The NIO Day hype train was fun while it lasted but we have a lot of people taking profits off the table for the time being. 

So if you ask me, it looks like it will test some support levels at 61, and 59.50, before we start to see another rally behind it. Which makes perfect sense as it would be about a 10-12% retreat from the all time highs. 

So yeah, time to find something else in the meantime.

KLSE doesn't make much sense to me. I don't have the data but the number of retail investors is relatively small, hence the real market movers are the institutions (EPF, PNB, KWAP, etc.). 

I've stopped monitoring local counters but if you see an opposite reaction to the overall market sentiment like you pointed out, chances are they're probably gonna release some good news in the next couple of days (maybe Gov free/low-interest loan or bailout?) and the big guys have all bought in. Same goes for bad news. Check out who the big sellers of AirAsia couple days before the Founders were investigated for kickbacks.

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

Rudeness towards other Redditors,

Spreading incorrect information,

Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s

Saying the N word without an N word pass

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.Who’s gonna tell him...Nice DDFor what? Weed dealers in east coast r at basketball courts😂 and bars or clubs for white and pills .

Half the reason Twitter has been relevant is mango.All the dudes pushing twitter calls after mango ban were trading on emotion. You’re looking at a huge possibility of a mass exodus off of twitter onto another platform, substantially decreasing ad revenue. It’s just numbersI’d buy it if Jack Dorsey stepped down and let his older twin brother Peter Dinklage be ceo.

Easy for lawyers to disassemble.tendies or soup kitchen?It’s your first day trading huh ?Lol[deleted]WhyY?Cost of contract onlyyou hold the contract. it’s up to you to exerciseBANNoYou don’t have to exercise an OTM option, it would just expire worthless and you’d be out the premium.Exp. Date?? The most you can lose is the 100$ you paid for the premium, when it expires worthless if its still below the strike price...Only the $100 will be lostThe premium you paid for the option is the maximum risk, if the option expires below the strike price it will be worthless.If it goes to expirey still below the strike, it expires worthless.BanYou are not obliged to buy it. So when buying calls you either win with the difference or loose the cost of contract.if it expires in the money you’ll buy 100 shares at the strike price of 130, unless you don’t have enough buying power in which case the option will get sold an hour before close. 


if the contract expires and the stock is below the strike price then it expires worthless.Either from FDS or an MCD shill angry we’ve been ragging on the clown🤡🤡🤡Make it to the underpassGo to bed*fffffffff*uck offindeed.comWhat is going on hereMan shut the hell up what are those, Hang Seng versions of the tickers?Googles ticker is GOOG you retard.

I gave up and accepted another sleepless night.This actually helps me sleep, it tires my eyes outTwo big announcements coming up:

* QQQN announces new CEO

* QQQN and ICLN are collaborating on an autonomous vehicle projectlike norton security 🤑🤑1) [This ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kscrx2/why_qqqj_isnt_done_yuuuuuge_potential/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) is a good write up on QQQJ specifically.

2) QQQN doesn't have options on Robinhood. I wrote this specifically for options play.

3) QQQJ has more liquidity than QQQN which is important when it's time to unwind.

4) QQQJ has more non-tech companies, which are still relatively beaten down and yet to recover, compared to QQQN.

5) All that said, if you're fine with stocks, then QQQN is also a good play.I'm so thankful I've found this sub. I've never lost so much money so fast in my life!

I had no debt and and my total monthly expenses were $1,250. I was saving 30% of my income into 401k and still yoloing for fun. Now just my mortgage is $1,250 and utilities and all that shit are so much more. So in short yes.That's what's stopping me tbh. Plus I like the freedom of renting but I dunnoI have 7 rental properties and it’s a fucking nightmare. Landlording blows and I’m not giving up 10% for manager. But have fun unclogging their sinks and drains and ant infestations and all the other gross shit that happens all the time.Because now you owe someone 600k you son of a bitch what do you thinkBuy a rental home first to split the costs, and then buy a home. Saves you a ton of headaches in the future and gives some play money after overhead is covered.It’s just so fucking expensive in ways you never even realize. I did not realize how nice it was to call the landlord because my garbage disposal was leaking and he just sent a maintenance guy to come fix it. A few months after moving in my toilet started leaking and i spent hours on YouTube learning how to remedy and the materials weren’t even cheap. I’m gonna sell and go condo route i think.Yeah fr.

I drive enough that in the 5 years I own it I’ll get to 100k or more miles. By then it’ll be paid off, worth 20-25k still, and I paid zero interest and the only expense I worry about is fuel and maintenance (oil, tires, brakes, etc)

Fully worth that to me

Plus it’s a business expense so all the money I spend is basically a discount. Because otherwise I’d pay a percentage of that in taxesI ask myself the same thing every day haha2.19 isn’t good?Wheel caps gains. I like unlimited loss/profit potentialAll gains.

If I had 1000 or more to start with I could have made so much but also might have reacted to certain plays a lot differently so will never knowI got in on TSLA calls right before the split and HYLN warrants when it was 16 before it ran to 54+. Those were the major plays at least. Now I'm super bullish on the major Chinese stocks. 2023 leaps on BABA.

Even the slightest search would've given you a wealth of information on what they're doing.

Canoo engineered/designed an EV platform that underpins two of the four models they've shown off. Hyundai was so impressed with it, they contracted them to engineer Hyundai's EV platform, who is also in talks with Apple for the Apple car. They've built 13 driving prototypes, and performed over 50 crash tests in less than 19 months (which would take a legacy auto manufacturer 3-5 years and over $1B) to do. Fisker, Lordstown and etc have done neither.

Jay Leno visited them earlier this summer. Yes, the vehicle drives under it's own power and Leno even drove it.

At $33K, the Canoo MPDV released last month is the cheapest cargo van in the market, period. It's cheaper than either ICEV or EV. It's 1/2 to 2/3 the price of the next cheapest EV van. Since it shares the same skateboard between all models, all R&D costs can spread across all models, and it can quickly and cheaply pivot to different cabins as the market requires.

# Oh yeah, because of the engineering service revenue, they've made more money last year, than almost all the EV SPACs, combined.

Got shit on last year. I loaded up on leaps. Of some companies I think that will do well and are undervaluedWoooshI’m in on all the trendy ev and clean energy stuff also. It will become mainstream. But I don’t think 2021 will be the year clean energy takes over I don’t care how much money Biden gives them. Economy reopening demands are going to go up. Prices will go up. And a a lot of oil and gas companies this year are gearing up for a big year production wise. I think it’s a dying industry. Just not this year. Also there pockets are very deep.Woosh???? thats what the power wall is for dumbass

If they can’t get you below 1 percent start getting up and walking out the door. If they let you walk out over 1 percent they’re assholes. It’s an almost 60k car. I’d be foaming at the mouth if I was the salesperson talking to youAnd don’t tell them that you’re financing for fun lol. Always try to work out a deal. Dealerships will almost always come down on a brand new car. Less likely on a used one but shoot your shot anyways. Good luck!For sure.  Tough to be living fat on the coasts in general.

It doesn’t necessarily mean they didn’t complete the offering via a traditional investment bank to institutional and private banking customers, which is why Fidelity didn’t get any allocation.I usually try to keep it around 50% options/50% (safe) stocks, and if the options rip I try to adjust it back.

ARCT followed pretty similar price action today. Hopefully tomorrow it’s gonna be back the the regularly scheduled 🚀🤡Good luck friendWait message me haha I really don’t knowOTM you never expected to hit with 90% of your portfolio in calls on a stock that has NDA's out the ass & has no catalysts until 2 weeks before expiry. GotchaMight want to do some more research before making plays like this. If the stock price is in the money for the short leg (your sell) and out of the money for your long leg (your buy) at the time of expiry and you haven’t closed your position then you will be on the hook to buy 100 shares at the strike of the put you sold and the outer strike will expire worthless. This will probably put your account deep in the negative for a day or two because RH will automatically assign you those shares and you have to sell them at whatever price it opens the next trading day. Also there is risk that someone exercises the sell contract early for whatever reason and again you will be on the hook for those shares but that is unlikely to happen. But it certainly can and does happenYeah bro if ur asking in here...you’re prolly good to go and just do it.Even better kingYeah I find it annoying that we keep rallying during all this as well. Kind of unreal how little of a fuck people giveThat’s the point. Addicts. They can’t use it responsibly. You wouldn’t offer an alcoholic a taste of your drink.Yeah I would agree that’s ineffective but you have to realize a lot of his target audience are so beyond irresponsible that that’s the only way to motivate them. When you’re dealing with someone with tens of thousands of CC debt, expensive car payment, etc it’s going to be hard to explain to them “well, theoretically the market should outperform your interest rate on this particular debt so invest that instead” rather than just telling them to get their shit together and start paying it off. I know what you’re saying thoughWow you’re a badassGMNow I get to quit my crying :’)

In fact, Long dated OTM calls have the highest returns since theta decay won’t be high. In retrospect, it’s easier to think this way. But back in dec 28, it consolidated in that range for more than a month, market was expecting a Santa rally & had the perfect wedge like setup to blast off. There was no real catalyst for it go down in the last 3 weeks too so 🤷‍♂️

Edit: I don’t expect it to hit 35 now but back when it was in the 27-29 range in dec, was expecting 40 actually. The ROI would have been insane with 35c considering the intrinsic value they would have, the amounts of contracts I could buy leading to higher delta change & IV Spike at these levelsYeah so I guess I shouldn’t touch tesla Put credit spreads with only a 5k account? I just thought I’d they expired worthless I’d get max gain and if they expired ITM or didn’t go my way I would lose my collateralNice, let’s get that bread.Cool cool cool feeing a lot of heat for my remarks lol.

I mean that justification is the same as Fauci assuming Americans were to stupid to not buy all the masks, I always vote lead with truthyou're a useful idiot for tech billionairesEquity, can't buy calls on cciv bruhOh, I seeNot buying back is bullish because it means she thinks it will go up to ten percent again

I’m in NIO right now instead but just sayingReally wish I stared during the covid crash. Only 3-4 meme stocks nowadays🤡I’ve been playing with some spreads but no precise strategies per-se (Condor etc). With those recommended spreads do you have a % margin you would sell?Haha, this is a partisan issue for you, isn’t it? You honestly believe your chosen side is better somehow? Dude, they’re all shit. They don’t care about you. Fuck Pelosi and Fuck Perdue. Stop SimpingSure is but democratic admin coming in. Buyden’s already outlined a plan that will focus more on renewable energy. Shit is going to printLMAO I mean, I'm always tied up in something. Rarely manage to sit cash more than a day. Never have more then 20% in one positionI know how to, was wondering if you’d rather hold FCEL or Sun/wI laughed if it makes you feel betterWhatever you sayNah semiconductor work gigs.  Music scene maybe something it has going for it.  Don't know as didn't catch a lot of music while was there.Yup. Dems and Reps have more in common with each other then they do with us normal folkHow would it start trading tomorrow if the offering didn’t go through?Good luck buddy. Went to ranger school with a psyops dude, good fucking dude. Wonder how that’s gonna be with the captain that is under investigation for the riots in DC. I’m shooting for 18A with selection date in Aug. Godspeed.Well, it’s not the equivalent(legally speaking). He did not call for people to be violent. The legal consequences should fall on those who chose to bring weapons to the capitol, not the president. 

That’s why we have the law in the first place. If I go shoot someone because I thought you did something bad to me, it isn’t your fault. Even if you did do something really bad, you still didn’t shoot that person. Therefore, you shouldn’t be held accountable.

Edit: changed “bring armed weapons” to bring weaponsBe happy that trump is out, my man. Likely no more republicans are going to be in office after this. So there’s 4+ years of peace and harmony for you. Lighten upNot really? All those right people thought TSLA was overvalued last year are not rich yet.I don’t even have the appWhat about OXYNo biggie. Most shops have dedicated teams who handle AWS and Spark. These things tend to be large and complex. 

Just read up on Spark, what it is and why it’s important. 

As to AWS, look up Lightsail. This will get you a small Linux instance on AWS. Just get it up and running, put Python on it and run some simple script. It should run you $5 a month. 

You can then say, I am familiar with AWS, Linux...experience: mid level. 

That’s your stack. YouTube is your friend and build up your skill set. Lightsail will at least give you hands on experience - better than nothing. You don’t have to be an expert but present a good list of skills and willingness to learn, especially if you list Linux and how you stood up an instance.You mean besides algos & big firms pinning it between 23 & 26 to shake out the paper handed WSB FD retards until said catalysts?This is the same logic with put credit spreads for any stock. So I would recommend less volatile stocks that won’t have 10% swings or sell/buy very deep OTM puts for the strategy. You will get way less premium but it gives you more peace of mindYou know itI don’t have a Twitter or anything like that but we both know what happens when you assumeDuh. I’m dumb. Good shit thoLol what’s the username im curiousGood retarded tesla logicYeah, during the covid crash I was like...damn, everything must go up and it did😂I make small plays and hold them until close to expiration.Dude, it's not even worth it. Can't argue with someone who is so biasedShe is objectively not the most corrupt politician in power right now lol. It’s not even closeSo what companies are part of it? Shit mooned already kindaIt doesn’t.Basically everything here kind of sucks. Great weather and weed though 👍Did you Read the message?

PI is required by the SEC to obtain confirmations on indications of interest after effectiveness but before secondary market trading in Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO begins.  The Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering is NOW expected to be declared effective tomorrow morning, 01/13/2021 and trading in the secondary market will begin immediately afterwards.  As a result, there would be insufficient amount of time for PI to obtain customer confirmations and complete the allocation process prior to the security's trading in the secondary market.  Therefore, PI has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering.You too man, maybe I’ll catch you at Bragg this fallUnderstood. The law is the law. However mob justice doesn’t work like that. A similar case was debated in the courts before that’s why this is not technically a crime.  Kkk member got together and lynched people in the past, in the court it was argued the guy who pointed the finger was not responsible because he was not involved in the lynching. You draw a line where you want but when something as critical as this happens everyone remotely involved and looked the other way should be charged. People don’t understand how quickly everything can go to shit.I’m saying they have to go together not that you can’t be right and poor you tardI'm not talking about the app, I'm talking about the company. Uber has: ubereats, postmates, uber etc.

Lyft has...lyftPersonally i don't invest in crude resources so not rare earth metals/steel/oil.ok I'll check it out thanks broHonestly I don’t think the catalysts will matter much atm if it doesn’t plan to move since we have shit ton open interest on Jan & feb calls esp 30c. If the market has some sort of correction in the next two weeks, that would make things worse and will go sideways in the best case scenario. I do expect it to be 40+ end of febAlso I won’t be surprised if we hit the resistance at around 27.6 wed or thurs, fail to successfully break it and come back to 23-24 range. Will be massively fucked at this range.

But if we do break it, 30+ coming v soon<3, LRHR.

Lots more too that I haven’t researchedYeah take hippie politicians over bat shit crazy ones have here so always positives and negatives.Yeah I read it. I’m not sure why you keep asking that. So PI pulled out because they didn’t get it priced in time to be part of the offering. It doesn’t mean it wasn’t priced with another bank. It specifically says it starts trading tomorrow.I’ll know who you are by your WSB lisence plate.Yeah I agree with that. I don’t agree with quite a few specifics of the law in these situations.

1) Q4 ER is starting and banks will set the mood going into Q4 earnings in general. With low interest and the market run-up, it's expected that they're performing well. It's really if they can blow past expectations at this point and what management's guidance is. Just meeting expectation won't justify their company's valuation;

2) Biden doesn't seem like he'll have a honeymoon period with how polarized Congress is. While he wants to get a larger stimulus package out there, it depends on senators like Manchin, Murkowski, and Collins, who are as moderate as you can get;

3) Dec economic report wasn't that great. Manufacturing is expanding but the economy is pushing out both temp and long-term jobs. Important to note, however, that manufacturing is a leading economic indicator while payroll is a current indicator; and

4) Santa rally typically lasts a week after NYE, so starting this week, it's over. There could be a rotation or profit-taking this week.The next 4 / 8 years will be the greenest fucking years in the history of green. It'll be so green they'll literally have to re-define the color greenBuy anything 30 mins after market openNext time I’d rather just get born richCan't wait to autistically look at futures all nightʕ•ᴥ•ʔ r fukcan't freaking believe it.

What do I doNice another green week for Tesla 1000$ EOWThis is just spitballing so tell me what you think, but the user flair space is a pretty good spot to convey information which works cross-platform. What if we created a system that gave you, at a glance, 2-3 pieces of information about a WSB user?

Say, a 'WSB age' field, a comment activity field, and a submission activity field

Maybe something like Noob, 1-3 weeks, 1-6 months, 1-x years for the WSB age, then one of three emojis (ice, normal, fire) for activity.

So your user flair would be "3 Years 🔥 🔥" or something like that if you're both an active submitter and commenter. 

This would probably completely overwrite our current flairs or maybe allow extra text on the side. idk. Just an idea as to how we might address putting more eyes on the post history of people bringing information to our community.

**EDIT:** It seems like the most common dissenting response is "Yeah that's ok but I like my flair. Would a combination of still having unique flairs and the wsb stats be a good solution or do you not like it either way?My move tomorrow is to “invest” large sums of moneyAnyone know any pornstars that look like Nancy Pelosi?

**A**: My move tomorrow is **ICLN**

Joe Biden, with the help of a Democrat-controlled House + Senate, will pump $2.4 trillion into the sector during 2021. My prediction is that sometime in the next 5 years, **ICLN** will cost $300+ per share (maybe more). Getting it now, even after a week surge, is still an absolute steal. Get in now before the real pump happens. This is once in a lifetime opportunity, we haven't seen an infrastructure change like this since the industrial revolution. The dam has broken, and smart money, even oil companies such as Shell and BP, have already started pouring funds into the clean energy sector.

The energy sector is about to turn upside down and clean energy will be the only way to power anything by 2035.

Words of wisdom.These doom and gloom posts won’t age well by tmrwMan... remember the days back in like March when we’d watch futures together and they’d hit 5% up or down within a few hours? Those were the days.Anyone else get a bit scared when you see similarities between the dot-com bubble and the currently proclaimed "EV-Bubble"? Everyone seem to be buying EV-stocks and they pop up everywhere. It doesn't matter which EV-stock you buy, it will go up. Same as how people in the 90's just put money into internet companies because it "couldn't go wrong".

It's all about which companies will win the EV-race in the end, and there isn't room enough for all of them..Stocks will be either up or down tomorrowHERE COME THE BEARS SLITHERING OUT THE WOODWORK LIKE THE SNAKES THEY ARE\*markets down .4%\*

The most impressive features are the intensity and enthusiasm of bulls, the breadth of coverage of stocks and the market, and, above all, the rising hostility toward bears. In 1929, to be a bear was to risk physical attack and guarantee character assassination. For us, 1999 was the only experience we have had of clients reacting as if we were deliberately and maliciously depriving them of gains. In comparison, 2008 was nothing. But in the last few months the hostile tone has been rapidly ratcheting up. The irony for bears though is that it’s exactly what we want to hear. It’s a classic precursor of the ultimate break; together with stocks rising, not for their fundamentals, but simply because they are rising."say what you will, watching buttcorn price action is entertaining AFTo everyone shilling Boeing puts.

We’ve literally mooned so hard since the market re opened after Christmas.

That balance is Nio and Apple car gaining traction. 

So. At open I’m gonna wait for the biggest, fattest, green Tesla spike and buy puts for March. Somewhere in the range of 650. I’ll have to look at the prices. ($3050 with 87% volatility.

Change my mind

Edit: the fact that the only response you all can make is "it only goes up" and "buy puts" should make you all concernedBABA $260 by eowFor those playing PSTH, I’ve been in for a few months now and there’s a pretty predictable trend;

PSTH should dip some tomorrow. That’s when I’ll be accumulating some more (probably more feb/June calls) . Small bump at market open then drift down to 28-29(maybe 27 but I doubt it). It’ll reverse sometime late next week and end with slightly higher highs next Friday at market close. 

Obviously, if there is an announcement this all goes out the window. ✌🏻Social security is an MLM change my mindThink I’m gonna turn $1250 into $4000 tomorrow :)New price target for nio from BOAWith all this PSTH shilling I'll certainly sell tomorrow.Snow in Austin caused a blackout.

EOW 20 FOR MY CONFIRMATION BIASGlad I went all in on TSLA puts on FridayHoly shit this drill, hoping we see 20k againWhat’s going on with RIOT? Have a buddy who FOMO’d in last week and was trying to convince me to get in before it hits $100So should I buy spy puts?humans are so brilliant and so braindead at the same timeRoony MARA so hot right nowBought TSLA poots on 1/4 and 1/8 if they print I’ll give myself the vasectomy that I haven’t had time to getFirst post I saw when I checked wsb tonight was circuit breaker tomorrow? This is exactly what I needed to see to give me confidence in my calls.# waiting for my STIC shares to BARK lmaoBill Ackman has had a cumulative return of 51% since 2012. If you put your money in the s&p500 in 2012 you would have a return of 210%


FOMOers piling into PSTH thinking Bill Ackman has the touch of gold are in for a rude awakening. Specially after it ran up over 50% from its NAV. No it's not stripe, or bloomberg. It's probably some boomer brick and mortar store like subway, that's Ackman's specialty.Anyone shorting Tesla here ?Holy shit spy just took a massive shitCouple days of correction before the next leg up.

GME has no solid fundamentals, their brick and motor locations are useless and their corporate culture is a fucking mess.

The whole entire thing is a fucking cancer shoot.Racist WSB freakout means NIO calls absolutely printingHonestly the only person that loses by caring about covid is yourself; so many are just not giving a sh1t and doing their own thing. I genuinely dont care if i get covid anymore, i can't live life scared shitless everydayI'm most likely going to get downvoted to death but I'm thinking it may be a good time to start buying TSLA puts. What goes up, must come down - laws of the market and as much of a gay bear I may sound, it's never wise to bet against the laws of the market.

For example on Friday I sold my puts I had bought earlier in the day when SPY hit a major trend line on its mid day drop. It later went under that trend line and I jumped in on more puts because there was a chance we could drop a while until we reached the next support.

I sold those puts at a loss when we recaptured the trend line and bought calls and rode those all the way to above 380. All of that was planned by me.

Resident JPM intern downvote once to confirmAre 1/15s still considered leapsSector rotation to Nasdaq 🤪Nerds who hate section 230 talk look away now

Section 230 likely won’t be repealed because it would be useless. Repealing would have such a chilling effect on free speech if social media is held to The NY Times rule that almost every scholar agrees that the Supreme Court would analogize social media to bookstores instead of newspapers which would in effect give the same protection as 230.

The biggest issue right now is what happens to Amazon AWS etc. that is arguably infrastructure, and when infrastructure starts acting too discriminatory the court might step in. Amazon delisting Parler is somewhat like a public water company refusing to provide service to a white nationalist group. It’s going to take some new doctrine to get there but this does strengthen  the antitrust case against Amazon imo.Idk why but I have such a hard time spending money on myself..  Idk.

Stop the countIf you’re Biden why would you announce anything on Trump’s watch?FDs on the steelersIs nio done for?QS up in a red market... It is such a beautiful sight.

CHALLENGE UPDATE:

I took a very big risk trading QS, and have been getting hammered hard by it recently. However, things are not as bad as they appear, when you consider the insane amount of premium I am collecting...

My true cost basis is $65 - $5.50 premium = $59.5 / share. After selling a single weekly covered call, that cost basis will drop to around $54 / share. Each additional weekly CC will continue to drop the cost basis over time. Which means **even with the stock I own being down 20% from my entry, I would still end up with a profit.** That is the power of selling extremely high IV options.

Only if QS tanks well below $50, and stays there for months on end, do I risk an actual loss on this trade. I just hope that doesn't happen...

Tesla is actually going to open up futures down 6% 🤔Sucks my duck, bulls.Blood red fuckI kind of feel bad for cons. All they have left is downvoting the evil commie comments on reddit 😔Holy shit apple!First, flair me

Most of you are too young to know you had to be the first 3 commenters on the weekend thread to get a flair. Fastest fingers wonIve been trying to gain a better understanding of the bond market and its relation and implications to other markets. 

I understand that when yields fall this is an indicator and effect of investors higher demand for bonds and as a result bond prices rise. Generally investors are piling into bonds as a safe haven asset and money  flows from riskier asset classes like equities to bonds?

So if this is true then the falling yields during corona, should mean that money has been flowing into bonds, correct? 

I have a hard time understanding this with the background of the general sentiment that during corona investors apparantly have been piling into equities FROM bonds due to falling interest rates and yields in bonds? Thus explaining the huge rally in equities. 

The only explanation I see is that money has been flowing into BOTH equities and bonds during corona, because of falling yields and a huge rally in equities? Where am I going wrong?

Edit: I knew you were all retards already but couldnt think of another place to ask at this point in time.Holy fuk these futures. What's a good stock for the apocalypse?Okay i am trying tk help out my gf is there any weekly call that will return like 15% guaranteed next week she only has like $200 in her accountMake tomorrow red and the rest of the week green so I can take huge gains from selling puts and moving them into sharesYou don’t have to fuck with country music but Jason Aldean and Morgan Wallen are people you need to buy calls on[deleted]I want to buy this dip.. but what if it dips lower$BABA fucked tomorrow?I know Ken Kriffin the CEO of citadel.

Edit: I don't actually believe this but if some fucking time traveller told me that we hit 1600 by the first week of February, I wouldn't be surprised; these TSLA bulls are getting so eager and the FOMO is too real with Papa Musk becoming the richest in the world.I’m full tilt on TSLA shorts & hedged with some ARK Calls has been working well.

ModsChildren hospitalMeWhat price would be green?Is NAMBLA a charityPeople love their flairs. I don’t like the ban info either. Like why do users need to know thatI just ate so much buttThis is stupid.  Lots of long time active posters are full of shit and people who never post and just lurk can provide pretty valuable DD. Like if somebody is mostly lurking on here and then they take the time to post something then it is likely to be more thought out than whatever the average WSB dummy shits out his frito-hole.  If anybody is stupid enough to fuck their life up by blowing money based on what somebody posts on the internet then you were gonna fuck your life up by getting scammed one way or another anyway.Why can’t you just sticky a comment on posts from people who have no WSB history?Once the user is called out in the comments for their lack of activity/age of their account, I think our hivemind is strong enough to shoo them away, or at least bring attention to the fact that they're "sus"People earned their flair, and I think they won't want to lose it. Mods are gay btw.Don’t get rid of my flair!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥Feels basic for this sub. Can I also please get a change in my flair to “Patron Saint of Anal” or somMaybe - but I like my current flair I earned from votebot

I also like the ban flairs to mark the degensI like my flair. Has a subtle touch to it.I’m a 3yr commenter and DD poster of ICLN in November can I get some new flairpleas include penis size tooSounds like a good idea just make it super short like 5 characters. Just don't fuck up former flairsAnything for a flair daddyLoses the uniqueness of it

Plus people make alts that they use so age might not be as fun as flairs given

Edit: Ban numbered flairs are kinda pointless imo as it just crowds the good flairsCan we just use dick ascii? The longer the dick the more trustworthyNah man, stay true to WSB. Don’t go vanilla.

People love their flair.Separating new people from veterans at a glance would be nice.I’ve been here over a year and still dumb as hell. No one should listen to me.I dig it. Better than the ban flair at the moment.Any flair at all would be nice...I think the combination of unique flairs and those with WSB age/activity would be coolLet's do it. I don't post anything because I don't know how to make funny videos so I just talk shit. Have only flair to gain.I think its a great idea so we can more easily identify the gay noobsI’d rather have a funny phraseI fuck with this.thats a fire ass ideaI think that only activity should be considered with flairs, nothing elseYes both would be perfect thank youI would like a warning like only has ghey shares, or gme retard ectAny way for the user to pick 🌈🐻🐂?

Like the idea thoughYesSounds goodI’m down.I love it - gives a weighted believability. 

Kinda sad though to think that the “local virgin” flair guy would lose his. It sort of is the perfect flair for him tbh.Just flag PLTR holdersIf it gets this damn prison tattoo I got for mentioning something between a boat and a raft I’d like that.I like it1. imo a flair like "ball licker" conveys a lot more information on a person's comment history than how long they've been commenting. 
2. I think flaring users based off post age has the potential to create a bias where old DD is pumped and new DD is in the shadows never to be seen. 
3. For a sub that dicks on boomers all day, I think the last thing we should do is recreate their mentality in possibly shunning new ideasBetter pin biden tweet to fuk bears.I’m inGayWorth a test run maybeI'd say try and keep unique flair too but it's a great ideaLike it. Do the account age.  The other thing with I've and fire... maybe.I fuck with itWhat if people hide their flair?I like this idea, but I also like earned flair for stupid shit too.  Why not both?I like the account age and the activity levelFlair me daddyGreat ideaAll I wanted for Christmas was WSB flair. To answer your question this is meh. It's kind of a cool idea but the flair here is such a badge of honor, I'd say keep it unique.🐂 and 🐻 flair plsThis sounds cool, how does age work if I quit and re-joined at one point? I’m gonna look like a noob :(. Thanks for always working to make this place better zjAs someone who cycles through reddit accounts every couple of months, I don't really like the idea.Just the stats. Or...if someone has been here say 3 years or more, let them pick their own (within reason).sounds goodThere's a healthy chunk of those who are very active in the daily discussion but don't submit much, and those are further split between the pure shitposters and the play discussers. That system wouldn't be able to differentiate between those who are dishing out plays and those dishing out shitposts.Reminds me of when r/bodybuilding did a similar thing giving flair rating people’s physiques if they sent in photos.

It ended because it turns out some of the mods were passing around the photos and making fun of people.

I feel like this would be an even more autistic version of that, we should do it.- too much info crammed into a tight space

- if necessary, the info (such as account age) can be gained in other ways; no need to duplicate

- it's irrelevant most of the time because people can post their positions to establish their credibility

- flairs for activity incentivizes quantity. could end up having users polluting more to get flairs

- better the way it isI like this, plus what you put in the edit.I don't think I would like this. Getting a unique wsb flair is one of my goals. Plus if we cared about a poster, we can just check their profile.Current flair system already displays notoriety. A flair system like you suggested, in my opinion would dilute the current flair system and also, unintentionally create a hierarchy which would not benefit the flow of WSB.

I vote against.We need gain loss verified on flairI’ve been here like 4 years and never gotten flair, mostly a lurker but I’m a retard that bough tilray shares at the top after its initial run up, I’ve earned my place in the community.I told my mommy when  I got this flair so you better not take it away. I'd be fine with combined flair with time spend in this gambling den.No ones that hotDo you even remember Battery day bro?I like your big dick energyIt’s almost certain now, with motley stimulus headline, PT bumps, NIO hyping up EV, good stimulus talks, and blue presidency.

Its a bathroom wall that makes money on ads. Advertisers probably dont like coups and murder promoting their new F150s...well bad example but u get it.People should try to take Trumps name and face off this issue because he is so inflammatory. Look at what these companies are doing and realize how terrifying it is they wield this power.how about the PGA banning Trumps courses lol. this is bigger than just social media. every industry that can , WILL take a piece of this pie and make good publicity from it. Trump fucked himself when he was at his weakest, there is nothing more to say. nothing will come of it.Remember when bakers were told they didn’t have to bake wedding cakes for gay couples? Social media doesn’t have to host terrorist.They are going to take away our shit posting.after this & what these wackos r still planning for inauguration, u better believe social media is gonna get regulated under full Dem controlMmm and who would push for this regulation?

They’ll just slowly bleed it down to keep retail from jumping ship too fast.Using all my margin to buy shares at openWhere do you find info on what Cathie buys?I was looking at that, there's no way they don't come back up. Probably won't recapture previous price, but I could see mid 90s within a few weekswith average analyst giving it a price of 150.00 probably a good time to get in and hold. How do you know she bought it?And why did it drop?Failed drug + investigation thoughwhere do you see information/news about Cathie buying ?Being reasonable isn’t allowed hereSmart no doubt. But if I had substantial money on the line at this point, I would just set alerts and watch it like a hawk. The crazy price action could trigger a sell when it really isn’t what your trying to do with a traditional stop. Just engage your own stop in your head. Just too much on the line.A lot of brokers have trailing stopsThe bears are down 14-3Or you could just buy PLTR this week and have an easier ride to the top.

Tinder is easy mode, get like 10 to 20 matches a day of 7/10+.If you’re holding for a college fund what differences does a few dollars makeIf you don't believe AAPL will be significantly higher than it is today, by the time your kids are in college, don't buy it at all.This dude next week: “so I lost my kids college fund on an FD. What do”AAPL overvalued, buy ARKK

But on a real note, if you’re DCA you’re fineProbably safe pretty much. It will go up soon before the earnings.Buy leaps on AAPL.

It is consumption.Breathe in fresh air my friendYo gotta get that gonorrhea taking care of bro! 

Go see the Doctor!!!It's simple. The CEO simply takes 100% of the revenue.Nope, ur right. CEO gets more comp than the company's entire revenue. 345,000,000 shares unlocked in March. SNOW is cancer in the medium term.It's actually so hilarious that the CEO makes more than the revenue of the entire company ahaha. IIRC it's all stock/options though so it's really just paid for by dilution.

I have no idea why dumb boomers value this company so highly. They are going to get burned so hard and then fuck outta tech stonks until they die and get replaced by someone else.Shit was manipulated up, I got burned on puts for a big loss in December 

I’m buying puts again on SNOW sometime in late Feb, but I’m okay with missing out on the inevitable drop because timing it seems impossibleMade a ton off snow, felt smart, then it took it all back from me.  In a week that stock can make you rich or send you to the poor house>It’s ... Its.

Start with looking into the people who are digital nomads and where they base themselves out of; probably a good starting point for digging around.

Also look into where US Expats tend to end up.

Lots of people ditch the US for an average life in other countries every year.

When the market sells off on scary news, that's BULLISH.

When the market sells off on no news at all, that's BEARISH.

Selling off on scary news means the weak hands, the stupid money, are panic selling.

So psychologically it feels better to think you don’t want one, instead of can’t have one.The nicest cars ever made😩Let’s goo!what happens in 15 mins?Lmao for what?You forgot the 🚀🚀🚀🚀If it hits 30 this week I’ll buy a lamboI'll buy a bar of steel if it does.

And again even if they can’t, they still living betterSteel is older than your great grandpa when he was in his dads nut sacklol why?😅Guys. That shit will still moon. Haven't you seen this movie before?:(Some new dude posted unrealized gain porn on TSLA 1/15 940c.

Look at the chart it’s like a million miles outside of the bollinger band*Grindr🤡\*Tinder>  no way we're finding anyone after.

People are going to be horny after being inside for months broI remember when I was in middle school.Literally can't go tits upYou lost me on step 2I have PLTR 2023 leaps, it’s simplerHmmmm I'm thinking for the first step use margin instead of wagesHold up HiddenPopTart, can you actually purchase 100 share of PLTR at 23-26ish and use that as collateral to sell a $50 put? That doesn't sound right.Deep ITM CSP leap? I fucking like this. I don't have 5k to throw at that bitch thoughI’d avoid PLTR.Good time to get moreLol. Last time he shorted TSLA it went from $600 to $700. Then he deleted his tweets like a bitchEverything crash Even Market Crash so Burry is not wrongRemember how he was wayyy too soon for the big short?Just have to wait two years like when he shorted housingHe said so months ago and it never didAnyone can literally say anything in the stock market, and eventually it will probably happen. To get a good idea of who’s actually good is how consistently they can predict and be right. Being right a lot more than they are wrong. Burry has been announcing TSLA crashing for several months, and it’s still mooning. He got lucky a few times in the past and everyone thinks he’s a god. He’s making a fool of himself with his tweets, many of which he’s caught deleting. If you want to listen to him, go ahead. Personally, I also believe TSLA will crash, and so does many other people. But something weird is going on and it’s only going up, and no one wants to touch it right now. It’s ruined way too many bears. Haven’t you been reading headlines about the amount of money lost due to people shorting TSLA?

Just be careful man...You can be right and still lose money btw.BYE TSLAI'm too drunk to post my positions properly, but I've got 4x  jan 21 2022 400 put contracts since Tesla is a highly overvalued car company.You’re gonna spend 2k to shirt TSLA?Apple homers will still buy itI imagine it will be all smooth and curvy tear drop shaped.

Dump the calls before earnings IMO unless they are way out.I’d say confidently over $1kTSLA was targeted by big auto, oil, and professional shorts.  TSLA kicked all their asses.  A very rare occurrence.You realize NIO rocketed as much in the past year as TSLA did? The percentage gain is about equal on both stocks over the past year...There’s 2 types of hypes on this sub. Hype when there’s clear good news, which means yes it’s going up.

Or hype just because something became a meme stock and everyone is praying together. This one usually means it’s fucked, usually, not always.I remember seeing Tesla at $112 a share about 4 years ago.

Code Red-Frankenberry.  Its a seasonal delicacy nowadays but an excellent pairing.


If you’d like a more complex bouquet- I’d go with Captain Crunch with Crunchberries. The mild  brown sugar and vanilla undertones come out after the pleasant “burn” of highly carbonated citrous elixer and Crunchberries dance across the pallet. Though its certainly my favorite pairing to date it is reserved for special occasions, as the citric acid in the mountain dew     seems to “soften” the roof of my mouth and after only four bowls and three beverages it gets so raw the pain and taste of blood become too distracting to enjoy my fifth.

There isn't a fear that it will be too substantial on the market, but while also being at ATH the upside vs downside risk skews downwardAccidentally holding calls that only expire this Friday.

🤡🤡🤡I am not Chinese and I agwee. Gyna #1! No you’re the first person to think this ever.It's a bit different than pre-corona for sure. One of the reasons is the prospect of inflation coupled with no interest rate hike in sight, causing things to go a bit higher. 

The second reason is a surge in retail investor activity not seen in a very long time thanks to apps like Robinhood and a little thing called 'desperation'. This is a soft padding but with inelastic goods (shares of Tesla for example), small changes in demand impact prices quite a bit hence the erratic nature you are seeing.

For a third reason, and this is the most speculative... I think people were fearful of a big recession before corona. Now that we know something like a pandemic (and maybe even an insurrection) will keep stocks safe, is there really that much risk relative to return?you don't say/\>looks at TSLA's p/e of 1,600

FUNDAMENTALS DON'T MATTER

NEWS DON'T MATTERTrump loses real power in under two weeks, so no one cares what he does as president anymore (look at how little effect his tweets have on the market these days).

His supporters doing moronic things like "Click all the ads! It'll hurt Google and Twitter!" is a bullish signal.Bought twitter shares after they banned the Mango.I think the market favors hilarious shit like the president getting simulatenously banned from all social media. It's the cleanse we all needed after 2020.When lots of things are uncertain, tech simply isn’t. Regardless of political comes and goes, tech is fully integrated into society and it isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Pick almost any tech company (not memes) and zoom out over the last ten to fifteen years.

Buying the dip after today’s lossZM is never a buy.  


TSLA is always a buy. 


And this is coming from an idiot who has only bought 1 share of TSLA ever and sold for a $90 gain in about a week.  
I am always 0.0001% away from FOMOing into Tesla, which means it’s only going to go up.  Until I jump in.I sure hope soTaxes were 35% for 8 years before 2016 and we mooned 300% during that time

Supply-side economics is a fucking joke. What matters and has always mattered to economic growth is monetary velocity.its  never been green recently with the dollar rallying more than .25%TLT has been sliding the past week.

Not an engineer but currently working in a high income job that I hate but it is what it isYou aren't bragging, you're whiningThere's generally a market crash every 10 years, so work for a decade, quit your job when it crashes and put all your savings into the stock market, you should be a multi millionaire 6 months laterI heard engineers turn gay coz they’re in classes full of dudes that don’t wear deodorant so they get accustomed to the pheromonesSlave away for a couple years and go travelI'm an engineer that's been making six figures for the past 13 years and I hate my life. The best my lifes ever been was when I worked in retail while in college. Sometimes I think about quitting my job and applying to work in retail.I mean you can pivot your engineering degree and go into just about anything else math/logic based. Make some money in finance, have some solid investments, and gtfo in a few yearsWhy not take a year out to travel once you graduate and get it out of your system? Then get your engineering job afterDo it.  Nows the time.  Otherwise you’ll be stuck in a cubicle for 20 years and wake up one morning and hang yourselfLive a comfortable life and put most of your salary into weekly calls in literally anything for a year. Then retire.

You're welcome, I don't even take fees.i said fuck that shit and now im living the wsb lifeTake 6 months off.  Travel the world.  By the end of it you will be ready for a stable job and friends.if you got that degree from a US institution, i regret to inform you that you know nothing about engineering yet. you’ll learn it on the job though so no worries.Life has a way of taking you where you really intend to go. Your present may not seem like that but if you put in the effort and make most of the opportunities that come your way you may actually end up achieving what you wanted to. You can not control the outcomes you can only control your actions. The moment you realize this and focus on your actions with 100% conviction you will feel free. That freedom is far more important than what people give it credit for. This is coming from a retard that got engineering degree in a foreign country and is now working in his 6th country.Huh...Bro engineers get to travel and work all over you dumb ass.. Literally construction nomads go all over the place and engineers get treated the best. Trust me you crying fagguette you wouldn't last a day doing the actual work you're better off flashing your degree at people and telling them why it's mathematically supposed to work on paper. such a kidFind a job where traveling is expected and see the world (or your own backyard) at your companies expense. Then go off on your own when you can afford it.Lmao as a professional engineer I can tell you your school experience is nothing like industryEnjoy the situation while it lasts.

I agree with you that it's a little worrisome but they have no legal obligation to let you say shit.You can speak freely all you want. But you aren’t entitled to use those platforms as you see fit in your own discretion.No one is obligated to help you spread your messagedo you not understand that the tech companies choosing not to host that content is itself free speechYou are welcome to stand on a corner and say things within reason. These companies don't owe you shit.Because it's their platform? if you want free speech, just go talk outsideWe really are fucked. You’re either too dumb to realize this and agree with it or your too lazy to careMy in-laws are immigrants who lived in the USSR before and after the collapse (Ukraine).  They tell me this movie looks familiarT...they give themself that power. We’re a capitalist country...so businesses can make their own decisions?  You can host and discuss whatever topics you want, you won’t be imprisoned lol.  Trump and Parler were banned for inciting violence. Your free speech can’t cause harm to someone else because that infringes THEIR rights. Whole “can’t yell fire in a crowded theater” thing.Twitter is just an Internet forum. Internet forums have rules, which they can set themselves. That the president of the United States chooses it to be his main outlet of communication is ridiculous in the first place, and now it shows. 

Nothing to do with freedom of speech. Everybody can still say what you want. Just not on certain Internet forums..🤡Free to speak as long as you aren’t mega phoning lies and inciting violence for millions of dummies to believe. Oh, and it’s also a private company and you’re using their service.Agreed. By shutting down their outlet, you don't pacify your enemies, you drive them to lash out even stronger.Your butt must really hurt to think that we care if you’re conservative.Yes on Reddit.

The question can only be answered by you. Clearly, it’s good to have savings and not yolo it all on advice from a meme stock sub. It’s the level of risk YOUR willing to take. Clearly, there are much more stable investments with much smaller returns. This is a casino (with a Wendy’s in the back).Always, ALWAYS keep back up cash when pour.Keep 6 months of expenses in cash as reserve for bad times.Honestly wait for some big pullback. Current run, even if you expect a long term bull market, is beyond insanity/euphoric levels so any minor red day is likely to trigger a sell off (don’t expect something March levels by like a -5% week would be healthy). Have some stocks that you wouldn’t mind owning and sell some puts after a big red day to take advantage of increased IV/premiums and generate some income without having to use all of your capitalLook at the karma number we can confirm!!!!People in HERE claiming to buy leaps 9/10 times sell that shit within a week.

On one end - fuck Nazis. On another end - don’t tell me what I can and can’t say.A belt is a belt to me man idk bout that I’d buy a nice jacket or watch or shoesAfter looking at the price of those... absolutely not. Unless there’s a whole belt market you know about where this can be an investment that appreciates in value (similar to watches or baseball cards) then please don’t spend that kind of money on a belt lol.

On the other hand - if you REALLY fucking want it and think it will make you happy then get the thing. But don’t fall into the trap of consistently buying shit because you think it will make you happy... hedonic adaption always wins and you’re typically left not really giving a shit about the thing after awhile (this doesn’t seem like it will be your issue since you have trouble spending money on yourself).

On the other other hand. No matter how much money I make, I’m still super frugal and spend my money practically.

We have moved from the previous censorship of objective calls to violence into new territory. Change in regulation=more censorship. They’re scrubbing more and more off the bathroom walls and eventually people are going to assume that what you don’t scrub off is what you stand for. If you scrub nothing it’s clear that your establishment doesn’t align with the writing even if it is subjectively wrongI only use Trump because he is a very easy example. Like I said, I could give less of a fuck about the politics surrounding the issue. But now it’s pretty undeniable  the tech giants are more powerful than the government. How we continue from here is unknownBanning trump, so hot right now!Exactly, but if they choose not to host terrorists, they need to be held accountable for said terrorist posts, no?In terms of stocks, doesn’t matter.

So we got jobs and no hurricanes. Proving your point useless.Thank god. Its too crowdedHe’s probably citing the 26 year old Boeing plane that went down in Indonesia. Sad story but there’s a reason why Indonesia has a major plane crash every year....One of their planes crashed right as it took off in oingo boingo country. They did not fuel their 🚀 enough.Another Boeing crashed yesterday. Most likely due to bad maintenance on the part of airlines, but I don’t think retail investors would think this through since it is bad publicity for Boeing again.

Hyundai Motors (and Kia) double down to invest $87 billion into GOEV over a span of 5 years to develop smart electric vehicles, with an ambitious goal of over 25% of total auto sales being electric vehicles by 2025

Hyundai Motors just acquired an 80% controlling stake in the creepy robot company Boston Dynamics

Hyundai is working with Apple on "Project Titan", an electric vehicle project. Will GOEV be involved with Apple's smart car?

Apple's smart car is projected to hit consumers in 2027, and be sold as an "experience" that changes our perception of auto travel. Think if Steve Jobs achieved ipod level creativity and success with electric vehicles

BlackBerry has entered a deal with GOEV to produce for their cars the ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) aka the computer/software of the car

Now imagine it's 2027, and the first fleet of autonomous, electric smart cars hits the streets. Branding by Apple, sold by Hyundai, designed by GOEV, programmed and secured by BlackBerry.

Subscription based smart electric vehicles.Well there is a 'business update' tomorrow...with negative news it might be your chance!


There is also NCLH and RCL, which could be better opportunities.

No need to kill yourself financially and physically to impress people you won’t see decades laterSome people do prefer renting and having done both, I can see the argument for renting long term. There’s pros and cons to both bro. Houses are a pain in the ass, anytime something breaks it’s on you to fix it and pay for repairs, you are lighting money on fire to property taxes and mortgage interest so the argument against rent is kind of moot, and the whole bUiLdInG equItY argument is retarded - houses are not a good investment, likely to underperform the market, and very illiquid with high transaction costs. Only buy a house if you really want one, never because you think it’s a good financial decision. Ask any wealthy person and they will confirm thisThey’ll find out when taxes come around 😅Nah, not everyone. I’ve seen million dollar homes on auction sites being foreclosed and sold for cheap due to job loss, divorce, deaths, etc.Not for stocksI used to tell the ladies “I have a three inch dick and only last a minute.”

With rates staying near 0 until 2023, AtATs high debt suddenly is a huge benefit. They have massive cash flows to pay it down, while paying no interestOne-time dividend. Does that hurt call options since share price goes down the amount of a dividend does anyone know?Which one would you recommend the most Xpev or NIO? I’m thinking about putting in a two weeks paycheck 😄The corn cult is expansive lol

I kid, but I’ve also never come across any mellows in Austin but I’d like to try itOh look. It’s a poorTell that to the $8k I made last week trading VIX.YesThe Osiris of Stonksbig baby jesus-virginI hope, I got weekly callsDefinitely won't drop around earningsTo shreads you say?Nice!!Oh my god I'm oldMSOS\* probably. He's wrong either way lol. Maybe in 5 years?That's precisely what i wanted to hear.“It is decidedly so”“outlook good”“It is decidedly so”Going back to pennystocks.Hahahaha.Steelers goofedSteelersNah, when your self driving car runs as a robotaxi and generates extra tendies for both you and Elon, the revenue from the sale of the cars itself is going to be chump changeYour close but not correct. I convinced my dad to put in his entire life savings in TSLA and he's doing very well, should be a nice pool to draw income during retirement. He wanted to sell last week but I convinced him that he's going to lose out on a lot of money.Yes, I have 'Tesla Investor' in my Twitter bio and I'm not taking profits from TSLA until I become a billionaire.No Fridays?It just popped up when I signed on...they might be randomizing the accessibilitywher edo you see this?I’ve got stake in GOEV, thinking about adding more on the news that they may be tied to Apple’s car projectMan all these tickers all time charts are parabolic except for FCEL. That may be good for a 4-5 bagger if it can get back to its previous levelsI think tmrWhat a [bundle of sticks].Short term though. Isn't this a casino?VREOF hereRed futures. Which will actually hold up because I have calls. A lot of calls.get out of growthI just activated margin and have level 2 lmaoIt's in beta. Only for some random users.You get a pop up. Can't miss it.lol it won’t be that cheap again until after the next splitactually gatekeeping an internet community with 1.8 million users. you're a certified retardPutting my money in NIO instead where theres about to be a run upI'm concerned alot of people going to get fucked by TSLA, considering how expensive it is and how probably 85-90% of this sub probably can only afford weeklies on it. I've been around long enough to see this happen time and time again and I do not think itll end well for call holders (and the whole market tbh) this week. Hard run ups inevitably to lead to hard profit taking and people that think TSLA is exempt are going to learn the hard way to take profit where you can.This is what I’m thinking, I think we go to $32 tomorrowBeen in since units and agree, the only comparable pump was that one day there was the bloomberg rumor, and that was even less on a percentage basis.TrueI mean, it’s not a hot take or anything. Not everyone has a birds-eye view of movementI do, this shit sucks. If it ain’t fixed by morning I won’t get a chance to FOMO and lose my money like every monday. It’s become my weekly routineYea fuck himNIO callsShort WBA sharesPTON putsARKG callsSorry for the multiple posts, had to go to my TD account...I know that’s my theory .  Let’s see how it plays out cottonWould just prefer 0 signs of life. Just random tickers with rocket emojis next to them.I mean todayYou kidding? If any weekend was a weekend to hold ANY calls was this weekend.Did any reasoning come with that?I looked at tsla options and it asked meIdk, they just asked randomlyNeverBruh believe me I know... our dumbass provider says they can’t get a hard wire to this side of the house. So retardedThinking of getting that exact pack.Quite possibly the worst advice given. 1/15 calls that are up 300%... damn it 😂Friday?Yes except it's Elon's mouth and my assBrother, I will ride with you to ValhallaNo sir her tits are fatAnd I’m guessing cheaper insuranceI have revised my price target to GME EOW 30 🚀Almost as if, now hear me out, maybe he got lucky in 2020Yeah that’s something you do closeted. Just don’t be all up in our faces about it.It’s -.24 now these gehy bears are getting out of hand.Yea but I make more money with gyna1/15 !!!!! All hail ccp!!Gynese yesFriday dip 🐍🐍✈️✈️✈️✈️This is why I come hereTesla is gonna bring spy down fatTesla going to drop 12% tomorrow, EOW $350.00

Get out now.YesI am a mod. I’m staying out of this but there is zero proof dude is a government agent and legit just seemed like he was trying to offer a perspective.Well my mental health has gone to dog shit since being locked up like an animal for 9 months , losing 10k on weeklies means nothing to me , so what other neurological affect can it have ?What happened to you ?RUN (rip), NIO, PLTRYes, CCP will reward your devotion to their cause.Plz daddySo your thinking upsies? A lot of tech earning calls coming up later in the monthLol when’s your exp and strike? I got 280c expiring mid FebI’m retarded when it comes to options and earnings. I think TSM can grow to at least 135 by March but have never held through earnings. Usually take profit then buy back in at next dip after if confident long term.Ok - FOMOing at openBOFA THESE NUTSBofa deez nuts!BOFA DEEZ NUTS

Morgan: $3.50
CFRA: $5.00
Jeffies: Recent downgrade to Sell 

I just didn’t know CS was also that bearish.  And understand the last part of the article tried to give it a positive spin as they aren’t in the business of taking down a stick but let’s face it wasn’t a positive note at allCan’t say anything bad about Cohen Chewy is an amazing story but the pet industry is also skyrocketing. I mean Petco is IPO’ing this week, or also check other stocks in the same sector like Zoetis, Freshpet, Elanco, Trupanion all of them are killing it (well ran yes but a growing industry).  Video games are probably growing even faster HOWEVER GME’s business model is broken. No one buys physical games anymore specially not in a store. As per consoles most are purchased directly or via better ran retailers.  It’s simply a broken business model.  There are so much better companies why invest in a lottery ticket.> This means something and I must know what

Super strange but legit.Because I have calls and my bad luck overrides literally everything else.Do they come with a complimentary Pooh bear?I wanna hang outWish my grandpa woulda told me that when I had 1/15 $700c back in NovemberThat's what my grandma always saysNeverI chose not to accept your facts. First!Buy and hold long termIt rose 20% in the past 5 days. I'm just keeping an eye on a small correction to jump in. If all else fails, I'll probably still buy into a lesser degree and wait for a dip for calls.“Management positions”I played the TSLA split and made a ridiculous amount so.....buy a lot, this is no lottoPlans for more maga protest, I think things more unstable than they appearWhat are you doing in my diaryHaha true. I’m gonna delete the app but I’ll still be online occasionally 🤘🏼Neither yetthat's a smart idea, but I'm afraid I'll miss the last spike before it pops. 

I'm incrementally investing like that in dogecoin because I've been feeling froggy 🤪Crox at ICR tomorrow at 930am. Coupd be some price actionupvoting is hard work palSecond half of March I bought half way back in to indexes (up 60%). I saw we were trending back up and wanted to get in at least partially. The other half I mixed between theta gang, day trading, and buying fucking spy puts as a hedge (up 30%). 

My biggest regret was buying fucking spy puts with half my money and then having to dig my way out of that or I’d be up 100%+ on the other half instead of 30%... or 1000s of % if I bought calls instead...

Theta gang dug me out of the spy put losses lolFirst time in response to corona videos I was seeing from overseas, I knew the “it’s just a flu” the media was originally pushing was bullshit. It wasn’t just Trump originally pushing that bullshit it was everyone lol

I also bought a house with only 3% down in last January and am up over 10% on that... 

This time I think it’s from vaccines being overhyped and us being in complete euphoria. Everyone I know is recommending stocks and cryptos it’s insane. I also think that Russian and Chinese disinformation campaigns are going to tear us apart.Both. I think we are in clear euphoria. Everything purchasable is going up. Retail investors are almost tapped. Even my homeless brother is buying shit on Robinhood and giving me stock advice. 

Also, the divide in the US will only get worse. This is a byproduct of Russian and Chinese disinformation campaigns. We are playing right into their hands. As we continue to become more divided we may even see an invasion of Taiwan by China or continued invasion of Eastern Europe by Russia in the next couple years.Why?Can I change my flair at least lolApple should go to the 140 MarkRIP bearIT'S A CAPITULATION BROIt's not, he would've told me about a situation like thatTruly the worst outcomeRight, but they just set themsleves up to enjoy permanent non-support of 30% of America. That can bite them later and is going to hit user counts.No but having 30% of the country angry at you is still a short term profit hit as they switch and a legit long term legislative threat. Also butterfuck, OK businesses advertise wherever their customers are...LmaoThose are the delayed results, check investing.com.   dumpppppingIv is probably like 300%

I’m going with Washington football teamSo if the nfl would’ve said Kap violated their code of conduct policy by kneeling everyone would’ve been cool with it?But the first amendment doesn’t guarantee your right to “speak truth to power” without criticism from a private business, just the government right? So why does it matter?The terrorists have won lmaoWSB is like 50% of my life 

I know it's sad lolActually did that for a while.. took a year off and moved to actually and just did volunteering work while traveling around the country and loved it. Parents and family convinced me to come back and finish my degree..So true as I’ve looked back on the small years I’ve been here I’ve gotten almost anything I really really wanted. The universe freaking scary for real...I like that perspective.. honestly been feeling like I’ve been fighting against “life’s path” for a few years now..Ik, I would say I’m pretty aware of the opportunities outside of “education” as an engineer.. and I’m not bagging on it it’s a great job (I’ve had multiple internships and have seen a broad range of jobs and opportunists).. just genuinely feel like it isn’t what I want to doI just sometimes find myself wishing I didn’t have the aptitude for it so I didn’t even have the option in the first place..They are literally just fomoing EV. Not saying it won't work out for them but it's not like they give af about the productHe was their biggest draw and they just got rid of him. That changes business.AOC shoes probably worth moreUh what size are those shoes? (Asking for a friend)You’re playing with fire my friend 😂Freshly worn?

Get a megaphone and go say whatever you want to say in personThey do when we have turned into a cashless society and where many websites require you to have their services to use anotherI understand that, but they control the way we communicate...

Just my thoughts, but it makes me sad.Your in-laws sound like they don’t know what the difference between a government limiting your free speech vs Twitter

Trump can give a press conference at any hour broadcasted everywhereWhy clown?Don't want them shut down at all!Expand past wsb on this trash site some pretty disturbing shit!!Trashy,eyebleach ,noahgetthearkThat’s funny insurrection a word but nobody knew until WednesdayIf the media can “censor” the government, we are the opposite of China you idiot.  

Also, his lawyer suggested murdering Pence... not even an opponent, but someone who was by his side the whole time.  Not exactly cool.So companies should be forced to take clients they don’t want?Lmao he was hosting nazis but yeah okay dudeHis opinions get people killed lol why is that supposed to be legal or permitted 

fuck off fashythere's a pretty big difference in that those vendors and lawyers are not supporting them based on their own will, instead of CCP forcing itGo back to parler...oh waitNot impossible but I don’t see it.

I’m not screaming bubble or something just know stocks cool off and flag when they hulk out like this eventually.No idea about that stuff, just know from a pure technical standpoint eventually stocks tend to give with a little pullback.I just need Biden to say steel and infrastructure like 20 times and im good.The fuck does that have to do with TSLA.

That’s how TSLA rolls.Monday morning you'll seeYour right on the timing, but with a PE ratio so high I’d rather be the guy taking profits now rather than riding this bitch down 20%. TSLA is going to be the straw in the S&P as well.  All those wanting the market to stay this hot haven't seen what happens on the other side.

Most of the retail traders have little stomach when shit goes bad, and they don’t have the bank account either.

No one can tell me this isn’t because of stimulus checks hitting people’s Chase accounts and everyone is like, why not? The fed rate is so low there is nowhere else to go to make returns, but it cannot keep going.37.5 expiring next week for now.

Why do people not understand that the 1st amendment actually doesnt mean you can say anything...Got plenty of shoes and jacketsHonestly, I just enjoy getting classier designer belts. Something like Hermès would likely keep its value to some regard but I’m not looking to sell this item. It’s more of a personal pleasure then not. Shoes and belts, I’ve stopped growing and already have an extensive color list for pants, belts... not so much, shirts I could careless, I have some collectible items but mostly I just wear plain white T-shirts and whatever color jeans I feel like matching with my shoes. I like the fact that these belts are reversible and last forever. I’ve spent plenty of money on crap leather belts that end up trashed in a year plus. Honestly higher end belts only get better with time if you care for the leather. I’m mainly looking to add a new set of colors into my color way or belts.

I doubt this would financially ruin me. I guess I’m just trying to justify spending money on myself for my birthday. Just a single male with nothing available to do for my birthday so any money I would have spent on pre-covid activities is saved because I’m incredibly limited to what I can do, obviously everyone is.Check futures.

Plus its easy as fuck to make alt accounts so if he was a shill he’s likely already back posting so what was accomplished? Theres a big difference between someone supporting China and someone being paid by china to post things like that.New Chinese terrorism group was declared in AmericaWe are trying to be prepared hereTrying to inform you delusionals on current events autistNo it’s pretty accurate and will mostly likely stay so for the foreseeable futureHe did actually on Friday.

We are really fuckedIsraeli tech is legit, and has been for a while..this is intriguing23.5Nothing lolHow long you want?How does that answer anything.Loads.Yeah I understand all that. My question is really in a nutshell: Why do people say that money has been flowing from bonds into equities during corona? If anything falling yields indicate money flowing IN to bonds?But i thot 2damoon🚀🚀Probably not but i wonder ehy you are saying this is it because you have no gfAnd i do i have about $45kI am trying to not lose her money thats why im only looking for 15% returnDead her husband left her cause he found out dude still a touchy subject but i didnt know she was marriedTheres no way you could be her side piece she likes brads 😛Thanks boingo sorry ill delete my post. Im trying to teach her😂😂😂FLmfaoooStarted from the bottomplease elaborate on analfarmerOnly total chodes hedge with VIX callsyou serious?There*This is the most solid advice I’ve seen on wsbNah we ain't gonna stay red, I just wanna make huge gains on the nio puts I bought friday. Get in and out immediatelyDamn that’s a good one lolNigerian Prince here...can confirm.  Totally legal.  Totally legit.Wow. So Trump ended the Paris Treaty of 1783?!? 

What did King George say?!hope it was a genius power play and u got paid 

cause if notI was wondering why the daily was so well moderated. ThanksI bought some last week at the dip and up at 10 percent. Probably pull out mid week once I feel good about the gains.So just buy all the LEAPS? Would it make any difference if I bought ITM or OTM?What kind for ICLN?Lol those hours are insane.good luck u got this20 hour days??? How are you still fucking aliveI’m in it I just want moarSame"Best" would represent the majority's consensus though.Kinda confused on the answer you are looking for. Alot of people are buying calls due to the stimmy pump and hype around the country going green. Calls = lots of risk if stimmy doesn't go through cuz potential dip then expiration.. Stocks =  less risk due to no expiration and lower volatility?Did not see that. Thought it was this year. You’ll prob make tendiesI'm down 10% atm.How?It is an ETF that traces the the fairly predictable VIX index or VIX index futures for your option purchasing pleasure. You can go short and long on VIX using UXVY, VIXY, VXX, VIXY, SVXY, VIXM. Each are designed to hedge for different timeframes.Oh like you think it will hit somethingGet rich off options you’ll get tons of puss puss. Chin up kingDoesn't matter, Dems love their regulations and conservatives are really really pissed right now. Like appease the masses level pissed.

 They'd like nothing better then to call it a monopoly slap them with antitrust lawsuits and look like the good guy.

I could totally see them taking a swipe at FAANGCambridge Analytica and disinformation was a serious issue in 2016 elections.I do agree that that's a big problem.I guess more risk based because if multiple stimulus force the fed (unlikely) to raise interest rates that will be the focus of 2021 and 2022 leading up to the midterm elections.

I don't think it matters per se and they'll pass a stimulus. $2k seems like small potatoes. Go big and give out $10k per personYou're rockets are kinda convincing, but why not CMC? :Dwhen it’s not subway ima find all of you and fuck you with a six inch extra mayoYea I’m good with whatever honestly. Every rumor has been a solid company and ackman can’t go wrong. I just want to see it within the next couple months otherwise I gotta push my calls out further again, and I really don’t want to sell them and pay the capital gains.Worth a shot LOL300k of it is on marginGlad it's nothing like that. I wouldn't wish it one anybody. 

I'm not going anywhere but to tendietown with my fellow autists.That theta tho😵Man and I thought $1080 eow was pretty retarded...I dunnoI see. What happened in September?Nice. Respect for putting your money where your mouth is. I think it’ll pay off. I’ve only got around $4k in this one but will probably buy more.Sorry... Was treasury yield... not too long ago this was in the .80% range. One of the measures to keep the printer brrring is low inflation, this is inflationary action

There's also been a treasury yield rate increase past 1%, but not finding the link for that. Basically they said the fed might have to step in.

EDIT: changed to treas yield > 1%I bought another call when it dipped to 38 briefly but still holding $30 2023 calls tooTicker?Maybe it’s time for another paper trading competitionPrint("Gang Gang")Maybe not in your area, if you are rural but it’s the most in demand fields. Overall.More than everything else regardless. STEM is always in demand and can go non-traditional routes far, far, more easier than a sociology degree.Political Science and Gender Pronoun Engineering doesnt count.Pretty much.Check other historical delisted stocks. I'm guessing it either pays out or gets zeroed. Probably dependent on if you can trade the stock after delisting announcement but prior to actual delisting. I highly doubt it'll happen though, NYSE already refused an EO to delist other 🇨🇳 companies.Same stressful division happened in 2016 post election. Idgaf what side you’re on man (I’m conservative) shit moves forward. Honestly half the shit that’s going on doesn’t effect your daily life so don’t stress out about it and just view life’s problems in general as cars riding past you while you sit on the side of the road. Don’t chase the cars don’t try and stop them just let them come and go.It’s always been this way. Now though we have two groups of people who can no longer agree to live peacefully with a shared set of values and each side is playing for keeps until one is flat out destroyed.Idk maybe... I'm holding nio for the long haul though so I just see it as a buying opportunityIn my early 20s I barely felt a hangover drinking shitty vodka all the time. I started feeling them in my late 20s. Im 33 now and they are brutal. Im scared of what older hangovers will feel like. I also drink daily so that doesn't help.I'm impressed. That's either a long time to remember a lot of knowledge you don't use or a lot of studying. Or both. Either way, good luck on your new job.Obviously mine 😬Yea but TSLA actually movesI'm playing ER too and have  1/22,1/29, 2/5, and 2/12. Mostly in 1/29 and 2/5🤙I honestly don't know, I'm waiting to see what TSLA does tomorrow; if it's flat and premiums drop, I'm thinking of jumping into calls, if red, I might wait and see how Tuesday goes; my goal is to play SPY 0DTEs tomorrow :DThis is Wall Street bets not loser football fan bets. Gtfo r/NFL here you goit was green friday ahSeems like that would be priced in with the Biden victory back in November but I’ll gladly take another boost on an announcementSame.....wtfYes, pumps can last more then one day.

Idk you’re smarter than me, I believe in u!I’m ICLN gang 4 life! It’s my largest position and have zero intentions to sell for the next 4yrs, roll call!!Haha I'm not a-scaredYou have a really short memory  because Tesla had a huge run up to Battery dayAgreed. I’m an ultra bull for TSLA. I think it’s going to keep consistently rising until 1T market cap. After that...I’m out lol. I’ll cheer for it to keep rising, but I’m done playing the lottery. If TSLA keeps pumping to $1,000 I’ll have made plenty enough to not care for moreSuch good times manWhy are you lying to this poor man lol. It’s only up 19%Holy fuck I’m stupid af.Ah rate cuts... we hardly knew ye...Think about whether anyone wants to hear that from you.

Dude seems like he has a messiah complex.someone has never been to a live game lmaoToo much big money in it to let that hold though I thinkhow do you get those?I get it for sure. I’ve just seen people get screwed hard  using a stop loss. Flash crash can really mess shit up. You could use a stop limit to guard against this. But then that might not protect you from an actual crash. It’s a tricky subject. At the end of the day it’s on you and what you want to do. But if you have life changing money sitting there. I’d be figuring out a way to check on it at work. Good luck though! Not trying to freak you out. You’ll be fine!It's just a flavor of stop lossThat's weird afDon't have one, good genesIt never is. 

I’ve created enough wealth that my kids kids kids kids would never have to work (if I had kids). And it’s still not enough to keep me out of the muck every day. 

I’ve had to train myself to self-care, because when I break down I break down hard...and then I’m no good to the gigantic pile of people that depend on me to be sharp and effective every day. 

Set goals. Meet them. Reward yourself. That is the healthy and sustainable cycle.It grewYou have it too? Fuck I’m jealousThis is true, 400k for a house for me, that was 360 at the start of the pandemic and i closed thinking “glad I got it at this price”. Appraised 10k above closing price 3 weeks later (it’s brand new)I remember the last time buyers said thatlove u boobooThe saddest part is that a shitton of the support would go to rural whites.

Prioritized and bought back our shares.I struggle a lot with psychiatric issues and I do believe cannabis helps cope with them. However, I've tried to quit several times unsuccessfully...Oh I’m sure NIO is getting a huge pump. But I think a lot of it will be premarket and I think NIO will open too high with too much premium to buy calls once the markets open. But if you’re like insanely ultra crazy bullish and think NIO is going to moon even harder than TSLA has recently, then I guess go for itI’m for sure buying in at a NIO dip. I’m uncertain if there will be one. But the premium NIO will be at open is not worth buying NIO at open. Unless NIO is going to pump like TSLA has been recently. That’s probably the only way it’s worth it. I’m just gonna sit out and watch. I’ll buy at dips if there are anyYeah at the age where its still kind of freak stuff people die my age from but imagine it gets much worse.And they’re expensive enough. I can’t think of another ticker with that volume/premium thoughOh so nonsense then? I've seen thousands of technical posts between here and stocktwits and most of them were wrong.

OPEC cut production 
Banks aren't funding new explorations
Alot of oil companies are still below profitability
Industry massively shrank
Over all supply is being cut
EV market isn't replacing vehicles at a fast enough rate to offset current demands

TLDR: Supply go down, cost to find new oil go up and harder means price go up. Even Cathie Woods highlighted this happening in her recent podcast 

I expect oil to trade atleast $70 a barrel and push to over $100 so the existing companies and countries can exit strategy to fund new investmentsI'm gonna take a look at SLV again. But funny money is correlatedI have quite a few TSM calls and was thinking of getting more, but the IV is kinda high going into this weekI’m fucking sorry I reminded everyone. Imma go #ropeMLK day my guyWhat’s a good expiry for the LEAPS?Oh yea if you’re talking shares just hold that shit. Short term idk seems to be trending down but it had a good run end of year. Probably hit 60-70 soon tbhWow he just set one up“yes definitely” he has stressed on his Chinese identity instead of Taiwanese on multiple occasions so…Because Tesla the company cannot possibly hope to meet the valuation of TSLA the stock. The market has at this point priced in TSLA owning more than 100% of the EV market.If it gets posted here all day long followed by 🚀🚀🚀🚀 it’s a memeYes obviously I know about the Hyundai thing...what is the added news over the weekendIll be watching and pulling for you.holy fuck were retarded hereThe only thing I’m worried about is inflation, but inflation is needed after the crash last March so maybe it’s not a problem. I just can’t see the economy recovering then immediately crashing again.If interest rates stay low/zero I dont see it dropping, where else can people put their money? HYSA before march were 2.30% APY or more now they are 0.2%I’m never holding anything through the holidays again lmao, lost 60% of my gains and got them all back afterMeant never loved but beaver love sounds funnierI can't afford one im poorMy wife came home and said have you ever listened to that song.  Holy shit.  Creepy.The only Dork is the Dad that can't seem to find anything in common with there Kids.It should dip this week, Along with IV. But I’m not sure how low it goes, I’m buying if it goes below $16 cuz Cohen bought at $16, but who knows it could go lowerSometimes i will buy if the price is right earlier, nothing specific about 1030, just choice. You likely will pay a premium if you want something right at 930 (sometimes you can find deals tho)The reason they have a profit is because they sell carbon credits. They also have way less volume than any other car company. Shit’s actually retarded this bubble will burst HARDHow much did they dip?Goodthat is why invest in the deflationary currency (Orangecoins)lol okay then I guess everyone who predicted TSLA hitting 800 was wrong because they predicted it too early. Shit logic!RemindMe in 1 monthEh not if you make bank. Bears get so much shit but it’s very possible to make good money as a bear. People on here act like you always have to be bull or bear. But why not be whichever one makes sense in the moment? So many permabulls on here acting like it’s a bad thing to see an overvalued asset and bet against it. Probably because they think it’s easier to just spam buy calls and hope you aren’t the last to fomoTy. They are tiny openings. It’s weird. I hope I can still find loveGod speed, retardJust gotta figure out how to get around all that camo. Hopefully they got good programmers.Go back to the fucking grave Bernanke, JPOW prints harder and longer than you ever couldSuggestion?I hear u/cashflow_ has an inverted penisI definitely took profit. Short term i had 1/8 60.5s made 200%ish on those. “Longer” term. I have a bunch of 1/29 60s, 3/19 57.5s, and 3/19 60s. Up between 100-200% on those. Will trim the 1/29s aggressively into conference rumors this week. And keep the 3/19s to play takeout/earnings. 

EDIT:takeout *rumors*Whats dollar tree protein powder like?That’s what I’m doing, there’s speculation that’s it’ll be 25-35, if you like the way the company looks then you could even hold past then. Idk, not your financial advisor

Buy the rumor sell the newsI have 1000 shares at $11Theta gang can hopeI tried waiting for a dip but it never went down. ICLN is looking like a good long term hold especially with Biden.


- Position: 9 shares of ICLN. no optionsI bought it as a joke.  Kept it because it's awesomeI’ve got 60% of my portfolio in ARKK. I just want some solid, consistent gains. I’m going boomer style.Of course not kingGot money on the over or under? My producer probably put money on them. Who they playingAgain as a non footballian—good for them! Hope they take out the packers at the super bowl (or can they not because AFC and something something.... I’m trying man sorry)P bullish to me ngl the plane was old af means they will need to buy a new oneI think it's a long position to hold. They've bottomed out as much as I think they will, and at this point, it's whether they decide to stay in business or not. I'm pretty sure they will, so it's just the long game.

When they bounce back, we'll clean up.how do you see corn?I would love a transfer to the US honestly, hoping I can do that with my company. You guys seem to run steady and pay well. 

I don’t work rigs or anything though so I have some decent job stability. Covid really hit hard though.Official news of signing deal with Hyundai for iCar by end of the quarter.EV rumors. Apparently there are talks of a partnership between Apple and HyundaiBetween that and what Q4 expectations look like, I would say we see a massive run through the month.Bubbles always pop eventually. It takes a while tho. And then you buy that fucking dip and do it again. 

Bubble has a long ways to go before popping. We’re about to expand green energy on a global scale that’s never been done in any sector at this rapid of a pace. EVER. 

The depth and breadth of this green energy expansion is the largest in history, by like 1000 fold. It’s gonna be a rocket ride for a while.Same hereThat's a really interesting question, and I don't know the answer. I will say that I just paid $5K for historical options data, after writing code for months for my new bot. 😬

You are correct that volume is a signal worth examining. I haven't really backtested it, though. I'm not sure if it's as strong a signal in predicting tops, as it is in predicting bottoms. I think declining volume on a multi-day selloff is a good predictor of bottoms. We saw this in March 2020 and March 2009. The idea is this: bottoms are formed, not when buyers come into the market, but when there are no more sellers. When there are no more sellers, the only direction is up. 

It's hard to get good intraday volume data.Ya Burry bets money while Elon builds multiple multi-billion dollar companies. Know who I'm going with.Blue or pinkBasically every stock is a bubble right nowI think it’s because the event was turned into a giant media circusif i run you over with a tesla, are u gonna blame elonFlorida man lives there and this guy ∆Tydie CCP scumBruh...that’s why i said itI hear that! It's how I started (multiples of 9) and rounded up to 100. And I've heard varying things about Robinhood, either that they just pay out the warrant or will actually let you convert. I'd rather convert if it's a good merger, but don't know what to expect with Robinhood, everybody's favorite broker.ExplainNice I'm thinking the same thing. Hold shares through merger.

I’m hella long term bullish on GOEV but got impatient losing money on it everyday for no reason. Might have to buy back inMake sure you get 100 stock so you get some on board credit with whatever one you cruise with.Go higher bro. If your buying two years out buy higher strike prices man.Ah, sorry. You’re right, didn’t really think about what you said. No it’s not tacky (in my opinion). Tacky either means cheap or bad taste. Lambos aren’t cheap and taste is subjective. 

Overall, tacky is a bad term to use for a lambo in my opinion. You either like and/or admire it, or you don’t, but you certainly don’t ever talk it down because it just screams jealousy.Which is why I went on to say the second part. And also a million dollar home ain’t shit these daysDon't worry, so has theirsYou might be right. I saw one of my friends who lives alone for the first time in 6 months this weekend and his social skills were so rusty I don’t know if he’ll ever recover. Pretty sadI feel you, homes. This year fucked up me, but at least money was made.


We just gotta get vaccinated, head back to the gym and build our confidence back up.I agree and I think Tesla is overvalued but the guy needs to shut up because he has much of a clue about Tesla stock as we do....okay?Per contract I guess. Was looking at June expiryno they don't lmaoWtf does a price target matter if you don’t know the valuation you are getting on the companyThat was a really risky clickGod you're autistic 💀I have tlry and nobody talking about itAnd don’t forget PLTR lolCorrect. TSLA is like a hybrid. It’s a meme stock, but it’s also very real.Thanks good sirNo problem bro. Im glad to help. Im  gonna try the recipe u/kangadoood put out there.

Buy the rumor sell the news#IV crush enters the chatThere’s a DD post here that explains it. Basically their filing is unique and in favor of investing in shares.

But the oldest boy who plays siege said the connection has been more stable with no hiccups and we have like 20 devices connected at all times.  1gb fiber line fyiThe app that comes with it is super simple and easy to use. Can see alot of the traffic going through each device, etc. I believe when you walk away from each pod, it connects you to the closest pod. Cool stuff like that. The only drawback is that each pod only has 1 ethernet portPaper hands — close your positions with a loss at open, or...wait until mondays power hour and close your positions with profit.

That being said I still have $10k in PSTH because of the SPAC hype.No way in hell will it ever drop below 400A lot of reports of "brain fog," inability to concentrate, and headaches, with symptoms lasting several months. It's still too early to tell if it's the kind of thing that will just clear itself up given time but seems to be affecting enough otherwise healthy people that I'm not going to put myself at undue risk. I'm trying to make money and retire while I still have some youth left, leaving myself mentally 20 years older is counterproductive.

Sorry to hear your mental health has been struggling.Literally just a slight cough and feeling tried for a week. I understand it’s tough for people who are obese and over the age of 75, but if ur not in those categories it’s better than most coughsSeems like PLTR 27-28 has been fairly safe the last few weeksI did sell my NIO calls and my BABA stock (both up) but the BABA calls were already down 80% so I figured maybe there is some upside. I think I've learned not to buy LEAPs that  cost more than $2k--but I'm about to buy some SQ leaps that cost that much tomorrow I think....I really love the semi’s this month. NVDA AMD TSM MU

That’s my recommendation. I’ve got about $600k in leaps and calls across those four tickers rn270s for feb and 300s for AprilWell the IV crush that people talk about is when idiots buy way OTM options around earnings for which they pay a lot of premium due to high IV. After earnings, even if they are right in their directions the stocks doesn’t move enough to cover the expected move so they end up losing money as the IV volatility, and hence premiums, collapse after earnings. Of course, the opposite can happen where as market had a expected move we’ll below the realized move and that is when you make bank or lose a lot if you’re selling premiumOh damn, count me in!Steel Dynamics (STLD) is said to be producing the cybertruck steelMeanwhile, Cleveland up by three touchdowns already lmfaoBut will it thoHow much does TD charge per trade?You're finethat's messed upBeen in THCB since $10.70 try again

Or do you think you're the only one capable of original thought.Hmm...I'm clearly too transparent with my wordsJokes on him, my wife stole thatI’m trolling, obviously you wait til it pops then by calls. I was saying QCOM is currently nearly double the price at the top of the bubble. So if TSLA follows the same trend, 2040 is when it doubles in priceIt’s different this time 💎Ban for suggesting banIt's generally a bit volatility my dudeDawg USA is not Japan, just enjoy the ride for now. We got two years of free money and basically 0 interest. What’s the catalyst for a huge crash like last MarchYeah, don’t get in at open$30 April expiration 😎But uncertainty not good thoughNo we said puts> Stripe chief executive officer Patrick Collison squashed the rumor like a bug on the sidewalk.  

https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2020/12/pershing-square-stock-will-find-a-merger-partner-before-its-deadline/amp/Well that’s convenient for everyone trying to pump it as a Stripe merger when everyhings pointing to it not going that way. Theres no law about them talking about going public, and the founders keep saying they have no intentions of doing that anytime soon. Can you show me something that points to it being Stripe aside from you wanting that to be the case?Prolly a good idea. i think their earnings report is Feb 18th.Neat. Mines a 19, grimmspeed j pipe, top mount, boost control solenoid, intake, inverted bilsteins, bunch of other stuff. Love the carNo, just small.>$QS

That's what I think as well, as that's exactly what my TA Bot says.Hang in there. The people you need in your life aren’t always who you think they are.I was locked up for one day does that give me more cred than Akon? Holy shitthat press release is from Wednesday: https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-proposal-enable-online-sports-wagering-part-2021-state-stateThats a good play, thanks. I'm in.I sold some $20 1/15 GH IV. Can’t believe there’s ppl that stupid out there lmaoBut let’s be real the returns unless you have fuck loads of 100’s of shares are terrible selling covered callsSo brave. Live your truth broRoku has gone up quickly. It will probably max out then dip in a week. They’re not TSLA.Yes, me too. But amazon isn't splitting.But it you didn’t have any🚀🚀🚀But why though?Eh I wouldn’t touch it with a ten foot pole unless it crashed to March levelsSPY will drag it down with it. That is usually the case when SPY diesDepends on if you think people will genuinely give up that tech because if what’s going on. Outrage is fickle and normally short lived. Full disclosure, I think Twitter is a cesspool and only good for finding things out real time and otherwise it’s just a sharks vs jets circlejerk. FB is just where people post crap for their families or just share random crap to other boomers. Really full disclosure, AAPL is bae. But also I hate it when it stagnants for months for no reason!That’s under that assumption that each and everyone one of them is going to completely boycott the companies in perpetuity. It would be generous to even say that 0.5% of republican voters will never do business with big tech forever. 

This then also touches on the point as to why the market is ATH while the economy is in the shitter. Poorer people are shits out of luck at the moment, but those with good jobs have continued to earn well. Vast majority of great jobs are in major cities, that are always predominately democratic. 

Someone from Butterfuck, OK is extremely unlikely to buy a Pelaton, as opposed to a person from San Francisco.If he violated his contract and they let him go that's fine.  If he's within the bounds of his contract then fuck em let him do his.True! Doesn't mean people have to be ok with it. Power dynamics also come into play. Twitter is the David to Trump's Goliath, here. Same as Kaepernick to the NFL.It’s joe Biden’s America. Now we support corporations ultimate authority!! But only on removal of free speech!!!!For 2020, same. No shame.Ah. In that case finish your degree then use your maths skills to live off stock market tendies and become a nomad hahaThis is exactly what i am saying. Our intelligence is too limited to grasp the workings of the universe. The best way is to control the controllable and be blissful.What happens is we try to make sense of our future based upon our present and discount the changes brought in by the consequences of our actions that are yet to happen. So you can not really look into the future. Focus on your preset and take charge of your actions. It’s as simple as that. An apple tree will only bear an apple , it may be late to bloom but if it’s growing it will definitely bear an apple.Well try this out for size my company got bought by a much larger company and I got 150k in straight cash. Only had been there a year. If you’re actually smart and get to a good company you can make good ass moneyYeah lol.

Zip locked baggied to maintain freshness.Getting more comfortable🤣🤣😍Oh shit LOLKk fine at least 2 to 5 baggers, happy? 😂So we should nationalize facebook?Easy, communicate the same way you use to before they existed. You sound entitled. At the end of the day they are a BUSINESS  and a BUSINESS can decide who they offer their SERVICES  to.Because they only have that power because you use themI did that for the firs time in a while yesterday and saw a robocop video.When your company basically controls speech, ya. This isn't a mom and pop bakery.

But glad you are ok with big tech deciding what is ok for you to hear. Don't like it? Stay off it. What's the problem?Not being democrat = hosting nazisWas able to get Feb calls for $25 a while ago and I’m rolling in it. I believe it’s gonna keep printing hence more callsThank god I was out at that time (sold for a small loss a month before), got back in after.

I told my dad to put all his money in VRTX, good thing he never listens to me or I would have been disowned.Oops I thought he said gravityyou're thinking of *charles* dickensWell if you get back in I'm the proud holder of 12 calls total.  Half 110 and half 105 02/19 monthlies.

I’m holding shares now. I’ll buy into leaps for next year if there’s a dip again.Honestly, alive just not well. I sleep through my weekends and then right back to the grind. Gotten used to running on 2-3 hours of sleepAlso this is Wallstreet bets sir this is a casino...❤️Oh well, give it a year and you’ll be doing just fineGot it so I wanted to hedge for 2021, which one would you recommend ?If you don’t know what Call Options are, that’s an entirely different conversation .By or before a certain date. That's what options are. Calls are betting it will go up from where it is, Puts are betting that it will go down from where it is. Calls are the option to buy, Puts are the option to sell.

Each contract gives you control over 100 shares. You don't own the shares, but you have the *option* to purchase or sell them at the strike price. You also have the option to sell your contract to someone else, which is how most options trading goes down.

Read up, my friend, there is money to be made and lost!Stimulus in 2020 seems to have barely staved off deflation. I would be extremely surprised to see CPI go above 2-3% in 2021. Rates aren't going up until we near natural unemployment again.just one of the founding steel stock of AmericaOh my god whyyI’m saying people here are panicking easily retard, not that we’re definitely going green.I admittedly probably bought too early. I could see it dropping down to $15-16 if tomorrow's a red day, but we'll see.For perspective, the 10 year yield was between 2-3% for most of 2011-2019. 0.80% is extraordinarily low, historically.I mean if they don't want the dollar to go to 0 and lose all global purchasing power, they're gonna need to do something to offset the printing lol raise taxes, etc.S-c-r or t-s-c-r-f. Still otc in US but they have Canada's most popular sports app and second most popular in the US. Deals with NBA, Penn and other casinos to open up sports betting as it's legalised across us states and Canada which largely has bipartisan support to raise tax revenue for all the covid expenses. They have like 500 million users monthly and are uniquely positioned to have betting inside an already popular sports app.

Doesn't have to get anywhere near dkng to payoff big time, if they do end up competing with dkng then tendie heaven.

I have 27.5k shares and will probably add more.I've always thought those were great.Yes that’s the statistic, but there’s more nuance. For example a Biology degree in generally useless unless you get more education

The market is retarded and will react to news like Paris because retail investors can't think more than 2 weeks in advanceYeah.. I’m missing something, I’ve always had this.You're a true American patriotThey typically make money off of AUM and other products. We are so used to doing our own trades that we are like "wait what why would you have someone else make your trade" - I lifted the below off of a popular WM firm just to illustrate how they make money from the above.

**Representative Assisted Trade Fee**$25 additional per trade*Flat-rate commission and fees apply*Didn't the markets drop like 15% or so something 3 weeks before Battery day?

If you actually wanna watch the game, TV gives you a better experience, you can’t argue with that.https://ark-funds.com/subscribeI appreciate the help. Even if I get dicked and it ends up selling at 830 or 820 a share, it’s still life changing money. I’m up over 700% from what I bought them. If that dips to 650% yeah it would suck, but I’ll be okay. I’m going through pilot training right now and our flights can take up to 6 hours, can’t really be on my phone in the plane hahaMaybe it has to do with the volatility.

I also think IF there is some correction, we are insulated being in the travel sector!Nice!

I haven't contacted them directly about it. I do use rh, but I own my psth shares on tda just in caseEvery share you buy comes with 2/9 of a warrant, to be received once you hold through the merger, so for every 9 shares you buy you will receive two warrants post-merger. The warrants will have a strike price of $23, if I understand correctlyI'm expecting some up and down until a merger is confirmed. Since I haven't heard any news yet, I'm not convinced we're gonna hold 30, but I'm always hopefulhttps://i.imgur.com/2uS4JoI.jpgFight me for itSorry for picking your brain for your opinion. down voted..It's a ban day - you were banned on the 10th of December 2020 for 2 days (1 bans total)

For Blanton’s price point I think I’d rather have Four Roses single barrel. Especially considering when I find it lately it’s been marked up so much cuz the name recognitionType VIX into your watch list.  It’s the CBOE Market Volatility Index.  Maybe it’s blocked for some traders?  I don’t know why it would be...  Volumes are low so spreads can get out of hand, but it’s been easy money for me the last couple months.Don’t mess with putting money in VIX if your are new to the game. Just use it as a volatility indicator for the market as a whole when considering other trades.  VIX trades have a lot of moving parts, expire at market open (rather than close), etc.RIP in peace

Username does not check out.i hope you’re right so i can afford itNo, just my current holdings...

Will adjust at Monday open.Bro if you can’t figure it out based on the information I have provided, I can’t help you.Jesus you didn’t even read that post: you get 2 warrants for 9 shares, and one extra warrants per 9 units which aren’t available anymore.You will get 2 warrants per 9 shares if you hold through the merger. There is a risk to holding through merger, as most SPACs drop then, hence the incentive. Shares are good because they have a floor of $20. Warrants have no floor and so carry more risk, but they can also offer a higher reward in the event that the price rockets.

You gotta have your facts straight, don’t just shoot from the hip based on retards’ DDs.Yeah I got fiber as well. Wouldn’t know anything about wiring shit like that. So it’s definitely possible? Might see if I have a buddy that could do it, so I could hardwire to my master. Would it be worth doing that, or should I just go full mesh network?The Nest WiFi access points don’t have Ethernet ports now. Just the main one have one Ethernet port.  I use a switch to hook up the ps5 and Apple TV.What makes you think that? I’m not being a dick. I’m honestly interestedMy last diamond hand was FB 300c ex1/15 that I got in September, was up 50% twice before all the bullshit. Lost a cool 15k so I’m pretty shaken from diamond hands. Still very bullish on FB though. I think the coming Er will be a big bumpYeah I genuinely don’t care anymore if I get covid . I actually hope I get it every day so I can finally start living a life and not be a massive coward having to put my life on pause for months on end. Trump got it and recovered like come onYeah I’ve had friends have it they are fine . People are making out to be some bullshit that turns you into a zombie like what the fkDoesn’t mean everyone else will have a similar reaction. It’s foolish to think soI did 25.5, which would've been fine eod friday but I panicked in the morning when it was over 26. PLTR does seem to be beginning an uptrend now thoughLessssgo. Are you just going to hold if it breaks lower?Yeah. I figured with a weekly or monthly you’re very exposed to IV with earnings since they’re often inflated going into earnings. I was thinking with a 3 month out option I’d be able to weather the storm if there was any type of crush or downfall in price but, honestly I didn’t want to leave gains on the table due to my ignorance or potentially go in the red when I could sell for a profit.holy fuck.I can't even text my boss to gloat. He'd probably fire meI’d buy some contracts to find out$75 to transfer an account and I think $0.75 a contract for optionsyou realize the first time EVER for THCB to reach $10.70 was on Nov 23, right after I posted the DD?lmao you literally made a post on "thcb and qs to the moon" on Dec 23 at the fucking top, please tell me what is mooning next so I can short itIt might, but a quote was created to answer thisAt least I’m not a bearLook im not trying to fear monger but all bubbles went vertical before they collapsed, I cant predict the future and I might be overreacting, but there is a scary coralationHere look at this top is tesla bottom is qcom https://imgur.com/gallery/lLghePuWhat time is the bestI don't think it's stripe either, but I think that if it was, they would still have to deny it.TA bot?yesI sold $15 G H I V myself and bought back to close when they hit near 0.15. I was pretty happy with my first CC experienceI put 10k into ICLN, made $2k (20%)from it going up last week and $160 (1.6%) return in 2 weeks. If I hypothetically sold these calls every month I would get close to 45% return just from selling the calls. 

Edit: but yeah you’re right most of the time.That's my thoughts as well. 20% in a week and due for some correction.Return to this comment in 6 monthsI’m sure you’re right. I bet there wouldn’t have been a massive uproar calling out the nfl. No one would’ve intervened and everyone would’ve acted mature.Ok I think I got it. So there’s different rules based on the perception or how large an organization is?I think his self driving will be his main competitive advantage in the future. I hope EV competitors catch up to the hardware and prices begin to drop tho:(((Umm check again we got time in this hoeNot my point. It's about legal liability and the difference between being classified as a platform or a publisher.

I should have known this sub wouldn't understand.

My bad.I get it, but they want to be free from liability (platform), but control speech (publisher). Platforms can't be sued (liability), but publishers can be sued by the content they allow.

They want the cake, and eat it too.Don’t Fox News and CNN already decide what is ok for you to hear? Same thing.Get fucked loser, this isn’t a political forum. Big tech makes me money they can do whatever they want.People were calling for insurrection and killing of politicians, big tech is not democrat or republican they just want good PR and more money.haha before i got into options that was the biggest one day loss in my accountit didn’t even know they had an upcoming drug announcementYep same I thought they were gonna expire worthlessThat’s the one she uses for herself 🤢As I like to tell folks, my business most likely is not your business.  But let's have lunch.You'll prob be fine unless IV crush. I don't really expect nio to stay down with such a strong presentation. I bought the puts on friday I'm just getting in and getting out, then using the profit from puts back into shares lmaoTheta gang is going to be killing youYeah - I don’t confirm your biases. I don’t fit in here. 

66% correction coming soon. Strap upThat answers my question. This week was the local maximum for TSLA.That's true only 10pm after all. Better idea when european market opens.Anytime you see VIX brewing while ES/SPX is modestly down means the market is pricing in more uncertainty for whatever that may be building up.

After all, means the avg pricing of puts are building up vs calls. 

Sometimes it's pretty obvious when market is pricing in a correction like back in early Sep when everything is going to the moon but then VIX was going green as well.

Anyways this is low volume and early. I was just surprised it was at 3% that's all.It’s true I bought TAN at one point lolIm just seeing too many finally people selling their shit. Which is why I said I see it flattening for a week or two before selling offWho's worrying? It obviously works just wondering if it works on an individual level although I guess it would become harder and harder to borrow money.You didn’t. You wouldn’t!No I welcome the competition and wish the best man (or in your case the best woman) luck! 😝What’s ur alt?Do you even know what the definition of thot is retard?I’d think the dude is an attention whoreEnlighten a retard, how it’s up 2% if the price is 229, but us price is 236??Adam Grimes has a book on TA that is good

Adam Mancini on Twitter is a good guy to follow, he uses nothing but TA and he does it the right way.

Those colored lines you see in the pictures in my profile are drawn connecting 2 highs or 2 lows.

For instance, there is one with a dark red line that runs through the February high and September high. 

The further back a trend line goes, the stronger it generally is. Intraday trend lines are pretty useless, but trend lines that go back months work.I saw. Very impressive. Good work.

I don’t know why you’re convinced I am making this up lmaoMy avg cost is just shy of the current price, so I'm not very bearish, only by couple of hundred dollars. I got in to diversify my portfolio more but after all of the political dramas, it's just sitting there and not printing. I'm tired of holding it while passing on other bullish opportunities.

What a dickhead.Your local drug dealer.   🤷‍♂️Basically your posts on Twitter arent press releases. They are ads. They want certain ads. If they censored your private communication that you paid for thatd be a different story.It is perfectly applicable. Scale means nothing. If i see someone screaming i should have the right to kick them out. If i dont then im gonna go to some shitty businesses tomorrow and start screaming lol.❄️ All you want, unregulated speech on the internet is not possible other than going through tor. This is the undeniable truth, regardless of where you stand on censorshipOr just be lazy and go to [cathiesark.com](https://cathiesark.com)Ah haha ya that would be a problem watching stocks while flying. No problem. Congrats. You are correct that you’ve already won big. 🙌Lol it’s perfectly fine to never be satisfied. That’s a gift we share. And there is no consumption without production in this instance. So that’s an easy argument to make. 

Just take my advice about the goals: “If I hit X by Y, I’ll buy myself (or do or whatever) Z”.Nope... only reason I’m half way comfortable is the

What do I knowBanks still are turning away from funding oil companies to push the renewable energy and climate change initiative/narrative. Means anyone finding new oil needs to float the entire project. 

You also currently have a bunch of educated professionals looking for work in other industries because oil took such a huge hit during the pandemic for employment as well as big tech no longer assisting/lending their programs and software for increased exploration.


All forces are making it expensive to find new oil while all entities are cutting back supply to increase costsPuts on CanadaGlad I heldnah to get chinese money you need to be forced to align the political correctness in China, like the hololive incidentWow that really is huge.

My guess is that travel sector stocks that are the same as they were in March last year are likely to rebound when everything blows over and people need to cure their stir crazy.

The only thing that sucks is that there's no growth right now, so there are technically better investments. We're probably early to the game, and we're missing out on gains elsewhere.https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/kui4oy/hyundai_and_apple_will_reportedly_sign_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfYou can also win by selling options or buying/shorting the shares toodo you blame Sikorsky for kobe’s death tooNIO day was boring.

Just one contract, and not because I think it's a brilliant play.  More just to break my cherry.  I want to do small, safe trades until I feel like I have some idea what I'm doing.  I have a couple 100k in play at vanguard and I want to do some puts as insurance also, I'm willing to spend some money in order to sleep well.Kinda surprised nobody has brought that back as an F2P game.And that's your argument? So more people will use robotaxis instead of personal cars? And that's supposed to help Tesla... how? 

You're a clown my friendYou said that already, but you didn't say how you know. If I own shares wouldn't they have sent me a notification informing me?Gotcha lolLolLol kI read enough PSTH 🚀That’s basically what I said though? You get 2 additional shares/warrants for every 9 shares you hold through merger at a lower cost per share. 

Wasn’t trying to tell you which way to go, just referring to the filing which you now are aware of. I’ll probably hold my shares regardless until it’s a target that I’m not high onYeah man it's really easy.  Mesh is easier but for my gaming stuff I keep all of it hardwired, but like i said, the kids don't complain about anything and I have their consoles on the wireless.I’ll start with - I’m probably wrong. But, I think with new stimulus talks, fall through and reconditioning of the Republican Party, shift to green energy - I think we are still in a solid run up, but I know that regardless of my political opinions on trump, he has proven to be a sore loser and probably has many advocates to help him hurt the US in spite (he is best friends with Un, after all)



Really it comes down to this - no one knows, I just think we have a bit more of a rally before a correction like last year, and then another turn forward, in the same fashion of last year, that will dampen the idea that Trump handled the economy poorly. If his last year and Biden’s first year are the same, Trump isn’t the “worst president ever” anymore, but instead “caught in the turning of tides”I’ll tell ya man...locking in small profits feels shitty when you see a position fly after you locked in, but hat feels even worse is knowing you could have locked in Something and then get absolutely destroyed. There are always new opportunities to make money by the market, but there are even more opportunities to lose money by you. Trust your gut, lock in your gains and keep rolling. You got thisWell its seem to affect everyone very differently. One of my friends is in his early 30s and used to run marathon, but he was stuck on a respirator for 3 weeks back in June. He is okayish now, but just started back at his job (he is a doctor working with covid patients). His girlfriend got it as well at the same time and she didn't even feel a thing.I mean I’m not gonna trust media on something like this. People like to see things go to shit, so they just hype it up. Everyone I know, including older grandparents, ended up being fine. I’m sure some people get it bad, but let’s be real, those same people would be rekt by the regular flu.Yeah I've had a few close ones too but have decided to wait until about 2pm to see if theta works against, if I actually want to close anything that's now made me money. 

I have 1600 shares right now so I'm playing with a fair bit. Closed all of them by about 2pm last Friday and opened for this Friday starting at 27, 27.5, 28.Average down lolLmfao right. What even is this game rn?I feel like I’m watching a college game, not playoff nflIf Cleveland manages to lose at this point it would probably be the most browns thing that could ever possibly happen and the universe would implodeTry harder, maybe you'll make some money too10:30am- 11am

But I have been holding my calls since NovemberTechnical analysis bot, but I'm not putting money on it because over the last 7 days it did go down at least 23%. Its likely we could see that this week as well. I can keep you updated on it when market opens.You can buy them back 🤨Just sell em every week fuck it lol20% gain is what I am waiting for. It hits that, and I am out. Bought at $350. If there is dip, I will hold and wait. 

Apple really could’ve had this market. Roku launched their product around the same time as AppleTV. 2008 ish. 

This is why I am not bullish on the iCar. Being a $2T co doesn’t guarantee success.Oh I'm not saying cancel culture would have been chill, just that it would have been fair and fine by me.It is not really a matter of rules. It's a matter of how those in power wield that power. Trump behaved poorly using Twitter and Twitter had a way to use its power to limit his impact. Kaepernick was using his platform as an NFL player to bring attention to something totally outside the NFL. Ironically, now that speaking out against injustice is a bit more en vogue, the NFL is doing a lot to try to do what Kaepernick was doing all along.For sure. On Carvana you can find 2021 Tesla for like 35k doe which I would 💯 buy if I came up big enough to do so😬😬😬You right, take it to r/politics they'll understand you there.There’s no legal definition of a platform. All Section 230 says is:

“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider." 

You can still sue people for libel/defamation for sharing information through social media, but the site isn’t responsible.Now imagine if only CNN existed.People call for crazy shit on r/politics too. You can find insane shit on any public forum with 500k+ people.

But big tech looks the other way because they clearly chose a side.Yeah I think they unexpectedly cancelled a trial so it wasn’t scheduled.

Still a huge overreaction in the share price though, they have a backup drug for that already in phase II i think.

You still in or did you say fuck it?🥭: “SAD”Lmao okay, I don’t even have positions in Tesla I’m cash rn. But yes you still must be new to the stock market and have not observed Tesla as well as the rest of the entire market since last March. Logic no longer exists pal.Looks like we got the next Autist Burry here

If it was so easy to time bubble, everyone would be doing itIt’s a secret 🤫Yeah but can you identify a joke when you see one?Making social media posts on any website is being an "attention whore" though. Technically, we are both doing that right now.I honestly don't know the exact correlation. I suspect we are leading them, and they are catching up to us?Fuck. I feel like I was touched by greatnessDamn bro, you might be right... she keeps sucking my dick, i have to do itPussyDude your digging here, do you want another shovel? 😂

I have a twitter account BTW thank you 😘

CNN? I'm a Europoor I don't watch your news channels, I tuned in a small bit during the elections that's about it.Nah you’re good, I’m not convinced until it’s +7%

I hope it doesNo you've gone too far back now! They're alluding to the Paris agreement of 1918 where Mr. Wilhelm and his howitzers were dutifully told to fuck off by Marshall Petain and his little Renault pea shootersEven gay bears like football. I’m not sure what that makes you.I think soIll try that, thank youI’m celibate, sorry boo.Do me nextDon’t kid yourself. Dems are gonna take full advantage of owning the prez, senate and house that they may only have for 4 years. 

It’s gonna be a flurry of bills. And they won’t have to send them back and forth for years cuz they’ll all be on the same page.Any chance on OPEC undercutting US and keeping prices low? I’m not sure how tariffs could come into playGme will never see $30 againso the actions he took to avoid offending the political bottomline is essentially politicalSame, I don't believe they have a beta car out in a year time, would be shockedYeah but the bubble has barely started getting inflated yet no where close to popping. You tesla bears have been wrong for years. How long until you see the light.It’s literally my name.Even if you didn’t think the dems would sweep that was the bullish hedge 

That shit is gonna be the gift that keeps on givingOf course buddy happy to helpI think it’s bad luck. Not sure if others do, but when I was big into sports gambling I swore off betting on my team after some unfortunate losses because my team didn’t cover.Ugh I know the feeling - it can be frustrating, but at least CCL is way above the S&P since April. We should get growth with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine data and more Oxford data by the end of the month.


There is also CDC data with what % of the population has been vaccinated, so hopefully cases/deaths drop as the at-risk get vaccinated...then cruise stocks should rise...


GOOD LUCK!!!My point...making money is possible at ALL times... bubble or no bubbleYou are going to extreme lengths to defend a corporation, and for that I condemn you yo retard jailI already have 20k in calls bought on Friday dip 🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🧟🧟🧟🧟Just popped up when I opened it.They will still try to sell at 3pm and it will count as a day trade.

Thats about to changeIt seems to have the right ingredients for a jump. I might go in with 1k-2k.Have you had small batch or single barrel? 

I agree the regular is underwhelming. 

If you like more oaky have you had Stagg Jr?Or Old Forester 1920You never know, it could work out given all the NIO news lately...  good luck!  My first option trade was a $300 SPY put contract that I sold for ~$1200 thanks to being a news junkie and guessing a market dump.  After that I lost a few thousand over a year of teaching myself what not to do.The US will always be divided into two groups: the haves and the have nots. The haves will buy Teslas, the have nots will realize that it simply doesn't make economic sense to own a shitty car when you can get a ride on a rich dude's Tesla for a small fee.It’s been the talk of the town in this subStill not getting rid of NIO thoYou just don’t seem 100% on the details is all. Eg “shares/warrants at a lower cost”Ight I got something to consider now. I’ll do some research, but if I can hook the Xbox directly to a mesh router i’d think it should be enough for me.Thanks man. Gl to you with everything I really mean itGood luck this week. I didn't roll them out yet because I think PLTR will regain what it lost on Friday.there's a ben's a rapist joke in there somewhereHow retarded would it be to log back into bovada and bet on the steelers pulling it fucking off?The fact that you bought common shares means you don't know how to make money off SPACs. And thanks I'm up 5M in 2020.Thoughts on 45c 1/1/22 ? Or 35c 4/16Your TA bot is saying $QS going up this week?Yeah you should almost always buy them back if you’re up over 90%. At that point the best you can do is make an extra 10% and if some news pops up you can lose unlimited profit.I would but the ducking Chicago exchange hasn’t written that many expiration dates.Roku's low cost for entry and partnerships with television manufacturers has made it an absolute force.

Bull signs include Draft Kings tripling their ad spend on the platform.

How is that anyone’s problem except the GOP?It’s optics though, 5 people dead and a cop as well. Big tech def responsible for lots of stoking of the fire but needed a concrete person or tho my to blame and they fit the bill pretty wellsaid fuck it and sold for a loss. i was over diversified at the time anyway. now i’m split between ark and icln and keep some cash on hand to play weekliesYeah I’m aware. I’m not new to the stock market. I just know what a bubble top looks like.

He is not autistic and does not belong here if he's taking posts here seriouslyMake better jokes retard😝OkayAh shit!My powers are weak nowDoubt it. I'm sure Opec wants prices higher with lower supply then lower with low supply. Everyones hurting now while China gets further ahead.

Russia and Opec need money

And frankly lets say they did. It would bankrupt US companies and eventually oil futures would sling shot higher even faster. 

Look at UCO and USO. Theres no world in the future that can exist as bad as last March and negative cost. 

Prices are going to swing up no matter what.Well I don't see you making that point at all. I was just replying to your one comment stating "You can't act like every stock is a bubble bud". Basically the entire market is overvalued at these levelslmao YOU DO yikes bro sikorsky has nothing to do with itPositions?

PENN $100c 4/16
OKTA $270c 2/19
APHA $8.5c 2/5

NIO $55p 1/22Nice, it just happened to me to. I just went to look at NIO options prices and it popped up. Good luck with these new trades!Nope. Just tired of providing info to other people for good money stocks, and they either don’t read what’s happening in other comments in this topic, or they just don’t research. Besides, the iCar news has been pretty big the past couple days.Nice. Yeah it’s fun I like watching games. This time of year is fun because of NFL playoffs. I also really like March madness for college hoopsI have had single barrel.  Didn't mind it.  I have not had Stagg Jr.  On my list.Huge Old Forrester Rye fan.  Huge.  Turned into a bar staple at my house.Except Tesla is currently worth more than the market pandering to both the haves and the have-nots.

It's always startling how Tesla fanboys don't understand how ridiculously overpriced Tesla isThat’s why I used terms like “I’ve heard” and non specifics. Wasn’t trying to be misleading just suggesting you look at the filing DD. 

Either way we on the same teamAnd you as well. We all in it together everyone wants to eat ya know. Much love happy new year100 percent truly retardedOr should I say. Do it pussy, you won’t. This is the way. Lmao 😂I’m fuckin with the $45’s... it accounts for some fuckery in the mean timeWell one of them but not the actual one which specifically says call.Interesting. So you can sell FDs on anything (uncovered) and once you profit you can buy it back to closeARKG has a pretty good stake in VRTXQuit making assumptions. When you assume you make an ass out of U and ME. I’m not claiming it’ll go up nor down, just stating my observations. If you were at all doing the same since March you’d realize fundamentals as well as any sort of logic is no longer relevant. Bubbles included.Learn how to get a real buzz (like meth or crack). I bet you vape don't you?Ima fan of the mango man

Give me racist redneck or some bullshit flair

Plz do me daddyOk then, all inThe point of my thread was about traders’ lack of conviction. No matter the circumstances of the market as a whole, conviction with trades is representative of your own confidence that stems from your research. You simply cannot use the excuse that the metaphorical “bubble” is going to pop in order to justify your lack of confidence and conviction. Traders now have 0 backbone and point to lofty valuations to give themselves reason to be scared and even lazy.I’m excited and ready to lose it all!Stagg jr is great. 

I got lucky and got a George T Stagg this year. One of the best pours I’ve ever had

Haven’t had the OF Rye but I do love a good ryeYour missing the forest for the trees, TSLA has solved the automotive and rideshare industries, and with solar and batteries they are getting into the grid which is opening up a new market.[done ](https://imgur.com/a/9wIRSaX) worth the $1

But, Definitely more risk.vrtx is absolutely dominant in their cystic fibrosis treatmentsI bet you have putsNo thanksLook at this https://youtu.be/CQr2wiFMMDMI understand this point and think it's valid to a degree but the current market situation is very unpredictable. We're at ATH, currencies are volatile, oil is volatile, pending tariffs and trade agreements, it's really hard to be super confident that any one stock or etf is going to head in a specific direction atm. These are the times where hedge funds and professional traders that know how to hedge their positions effectively make their worthI have started the move over as so much new "premium" bourbon is trending towards scotchSo it's going into... another saturated, low-margin bubble market? That again doesn't explain why the valuation is so ridiculously high.God I can’t imagine getting assigned on some shit for like 50k.

Talk about going down in history in a bad wayIf AOC made an OnlyFans she could singlehandedly pay off the entire debt of the United StatesWho is holding GME shares still?? I need to see how many of us are still holdingPuts on myself. I watched WSB for months about GME and did nothing. Congratulations to all who made tendies on this.I straight up could not do my job being up over 100k GME gang) while in a patient’s home today. I finally apologized I told them I was very distracted because I had a big win today in the market(which is pretty unprofessional). This 85 year-old women says to me, are you in NIO on Robinhood?

And by love I ***actually*** mean hateI bought cyberpunk at GameStop yesterday, you're welcome wsb.Waiting for u/deepfuckingvalue to post his gains is like waiting for $TSLA earnings to be releasedAs a teacher living a miserable life during this pandemic teaching, getting on RH today and seeing my GME calls be worth more than I make in a month truly brought tears to my eyes. Unbelievable feeling and doesn't feel real lol[removed]https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366

Told you guys it wasn't the short squeeze we were looking for, this is merely the teaser.

>“We will not be seeing a massive drop in shares shorted over the next few days, more like a 10%-20% drop which would mean 7 to 14 million of shares covered, which is nowhere near the almost 70 million shares traded this morning,” the analyst said. “Long buyers are the primary force driving GME’s stock price up. “

Keep holding, shorters only covered a small % of what they shorted. Longer we hold the more they panic.GME squeeze confirmation bias porn here ya go 

https://imgur.com/gallery/x0SRNXpI’m going to be honest. Today is my cake day. I have been on this website and wallstreetbets for so long. I feel like I’ve been here to witness so many plays come and go. So many that I’ve seen enough losers and WSBers lose their money that $ROPE was always on the menu. Enough to give me PTSD from following some of them. Today, was the most genius and brilliant thing I’ve ever seen on this website and it cannot be understated what Game Gang did. They had a hypothesis, a proven thesis & conviction to not paper hand when the squeeze that was said to come never came. It took patience, determination and will. It took literally getting together to make memes to double down & then triple down & then GME was 80-90% of some people’s portfolios. You guys were fighting naked short abuse & when this was called out you nutted up banded together and reported it to the SEC. Everything was calculated and organized. And because of that, I don’t believe Max pain is even close for shorts. GME quite literally could squeeze to $50 and beyond. And you guys deserve every single second of it as long as you remain with that same conviction. I also wouldn’t blame you for taking profits and playing some other plays that I’m sure you’ve been dying to play but all your money has been Game gang diamond hands. Seriously, props to all of you. It’s one of the most legendary things I’ve seen in my life. I’ve never seen this much gain porn on the front page at once before. Ever.

Long Edit: I’ve been on this website so long that I remember being a teenager over a decade ago and the front page was scientific articles & journals shit and people actually read stuff & commented with good discussion. Now I don’t even do that shit anymore 😂🚀🚀🚀🚀Thursday, January 14. Joe Biden walks up to the podium. He immediately begins his speech by pledging 3 trillion dollars into green energy by 2025, and immediate reentry into the paris climate agreement. ICLN triples. He then says all gasoline fueled cars banned by 2025. TSLA goes to 2,000. Then for the grand finale, he announces a government contract with gamestop to include an xbox with every 2,000 stimmy check, to all 300 million americans. The rate of GME's stock price increase shuts down every financial institutions network infrastructure. Wall Street's servers all catch on fire. The last quoted GME share price anyone caught a glimpse of was well over 10,000. In the aftermath, the executives of melvin capital are charged with treason for shorting an honest american stock and short selling is banned forever. America is great again.Well, GME finally showed it’s true colors.  This is just the beginning boys.  This was just a Correction back to what the actual price should be.

Wait for the real short squeeze.  Some shorts might have covered today, but not a majority.  Still a lot more action to come these next few weeks.

GME gang gang

The real winners were yolo call buyers that made 14,000%+ in 2 hours 

Reminds me of guys holding TSLA shares for years only for it to bounce between 250-350

And retards buying calls this year riding it from 350—> $4,000+ in a few months 


Timing is everything man sheesh 


If you made 1,000%+ on GME today you’re a legend 🍾Free my man PLTR he din do nunMan it feels fucking wonderful to be on the winning side of a massive trade like GME today. I've got a heart monitor on right now for some problems and I must have logged 15 cardiac events in a matter of hours while I was working today. Dude this shits better than any drug I've ever taken

Edit: Thanks for the award kind stranger! Ya'll are trying to kill me by getting my heart rate going lmaoWaiting up until Biden announces that GameStop is becoming a Cabinet agency.warren buffet has been old all our livesMy favorite part about today: Every time that GME dropped a few cents on its way up, people would start bragging about the puts they just bought only to get fucked minutes laterIs GME continuing to ROCKET tomorrow? I NEED TO KNOW!Cramer gonna pump the shit out of GME tonight and then we go straight upGod watching /u/DeepFuckingValue do his thing gives me serious envy, dude set himself up for life and I’m over here bleeding on ICLN calls lolI have a confession:

Sold 1800 GME shares so I could play PLTR for a couple weeks and now I'm cryingWhole market rotation into GME tomorrowBreaking: Trump banned from Club Penguin# I just want to point out that I was banned by gay mods for recommending Lucid days ago and now fucking look at it.

I will now stop using large caps. Thank you.GME held up surprisingly strong in my opinion. Can’t wait to see the gains pornCan’t wait to fucking wake up at 2:02 am and see GME at 42.70I just made my annual salary in a few days on CCIV

All I had to do was click a few buttons compared to working 60 hours a week for some assholeheld my gme calls expiring fridayIf deepfuckingvalue is still in gme it’s hitting $40To my GME soldiers out there. I salute you, and no matter where this journey takes us it has been an incredible ride so farI really need biden to announce "trillions of dollars to retarded energy companies" tomorrow or else there is a 9/10 chance i toaster bathAnalyst think only 7% of shorts were covered out of 71 million shares lmfaooTsla $1200 premarketKinda stupid a fund manager can just buy up companies, announce a retarded ETF filled with meme stocks, and pump her own positions to oblivion.

We told you countless times. You had every opportunity to get in, but no. You made fun of us and referenced Blockbuster. You said it would go bankrupt. You denied a short squeeze was possible.


Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.


And we're still holding.^ The idiot who bought 40c FDs on GME when it was at 34Pro tip: buy calls *before* it goes up, not after it already went upMy entire portfolio is slowly turning into just ark etfsBuying gme immediately at openARKX is a wsb wet dream lmaoYou guys doing good?

GME treat you alright?

Bout time some of you had a win.  I'm proud of you.The media is going to be pumping GME to retail all night long.  Tomorrow should be lit.If you told me GME would hit $40 in mid January mid last year, I would have called you a fucking retard. Congrats to all you fucking retards, proud of you.2021 monthly budget:

- 25% for rent

- 10% for mozzarella sticks

- 95% for GME/TSLA fds 

- 125% for Mama Cathie’s new Space exploration ETFBut really, who the FUCK shops at GameStopBan me if GME 50 tomorrow# this is a joke about futures being up alotThis sub needs to start collectively handing out upgrades and downgrades to stocks. Idk how we can get it done with a voting system or something, but I’m tired of these fucks just shelling out their ratings when shit doesn’t go their way. Also it would be fuckin hilariousMy DD on ICLN:

If we don’t go green, we die.

The End.Gamestop and wallstreetbets will go down in HISTORY for today boys, I’d hate be Melvin rn 😂It's so much easier making money when you have a larger trading account.

With 1M you can make 10k on a 1% price movement on a stonk or option. With 10k it would take a 100% movement to make the same amount.

Trading on 1% movements is incredibly easy. Even 5% movements on options is fairly easy if it's a planned trade.

This week I've been trading with 50k and easily making more than $500 per day without even leveraging my whole account. You don't even need to trade options. Just buy dips and sell for a very modest margin of profit, then look for the next dip. There's thousands of stonks and always something selling at a discount. Save options for plays where your confidence is exceptionally high.WE RUN THIS NOW

No seriously, how long before this sub gets deleted?JPow gonna roll out the carpet and set up the home run when he speaks in the morning with key phrases such as:

Not considering increasing rates

Use a full range of tools

Extended PPP

I had sex with Steven Mnuchin’s wife

Inflation target not reached

Aim for full employment

And then Sleepy comes on CNBC and lays down his shriveled up, veiny, and mucous ridden 3 trillion dollar cock. Says things like:

Biggest public works project since FDR

$2000 stimulus check, maybe more later

Expanded unemployment 

PLTR contracts

Free COVID emergency healthcare 

Student loan forgiveness

GME shares for everyone

EV tax credit

Solar

Legalize weed

On top of all that if he slaps a catchy slogan on a red hat like: Make America healthy again, or DOW 40,000

Then bears are actually fucked. Big tech voted with their wallets. Shits about to get grizzly for you bears.take out 10k in student loans

biden will announce he will forgive upto 10k in student loans

Someone called Cramer today and said he dropped $52,000 into sea world bc of WSB (who was recommending sea world??) 

And Cramer instantly looked at the camera with a twinkle in his eyes upon hearing “WSB” ✨😂😂

JUST COME OUT AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF CRAMERCathie should hold once a week live streams where she just breastfeeds a random WSB retard for fun.If you're an idiot who made 6 figures on gme, consider joining theta gang.

Get readyHoly fuck the GME posts are full of “first comment here what do I do” 

That scares meCathie is going to milk the fuck out of this space etf. It’s literally going to be SPCE and a bunch of meme companies from her 3D printing etf. This pop will be legendary.So what price do you think GME is gonna close at on Friday and why is it $100ARKX ETF up 20% in pre-existenceGIVE ME ANOTHER 90% GME DAY TOMORROW. I MISSED THIS ONE!Is it weird that even though I'm not in GME (I got a couple of $k off of it before it became *the* meme), I am still **super** proud of you guys, and I have zero jealously? 

Congrats guys. Fuk the bigs. Fuk the bears. Fuking hold and let them bleed and suffer. Don't give out any life boats. DEEP says when you sell.Simps: Today is the day Harden got traded to the Nets

Intellectuals: today is the day GME squozeFirst of all, congrats to all of you and your GME wins. Unreal.

I have no idea what to do tomorrow. I closed all

wsb retard: too late or does it have more room?Honestly thought you were all idiots for investing in GME but I was wrong, I was really really fucking wrong.ICLN#Yes, dad.

**I'm finally winning.**ICLN = I cum loudly nowWho else got nothing done all day because they were too busy watching GMEY’all remember those random nights someone was just giving awards to literally every single comment? I think it was Cramer

Edit: y’all really made a lot of money on gme today🤣🤣 giving out awards lolWow i think i might watch Cramer again. He’s suddenly started acting like he understands that there are no rulesMe and my girlfriend each get one exception to cheat on each other. Hers is Zach effron and mine is cathie woods 😍The SEC has concluded its investigation into user DeepValue after catching wind of astronomically high GME gains: Registered IP address discovered to be Michael Burry’s personal laptop!tomorrow is gonna be fucking insane If your future self isn't travelling back in time to prevent you from making a trade, then it's probably not that bad.Yeah the stress of trading has probably shaven at least 4 years off of my life. But after opening my robinhood up in 2017, guess who has two thumbs and made slightly over $300?I wonder if the employees of GME have any idea what’s going on lolI LOVE YOU ALL GOD DAMN , EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU!!

EVEN THE GAY BEARS WHO FUCK ME SOMETIMES BECAUSE I KNOW YOU MOFOS MAKE THE BEST MEMES EVER!!!! 

MADE 20K ON GME TODAY AND NOTHING GOES BETTER AFTER A HARD DAYS WORK THAN WATCHING THESE MEMES!!!!

Position :FOMO YOLO 39$c 1/29 /Still holding 23$c 25$c 4/16The employees that work at GME probably fucking hate that place and have no idea how there’s millions of retards who worship it lolI checked my phone during my break at work and I saw that GME was up 70%. I didn’t even have shares but my heart skipped a beat. I was so happy for those of you who bought in🥲

Now in GME at $34.02I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. If AOC made an OnlyFans she could singlehandedly pay off the entire debt of the United States.Vanguard 1-800 agents working overtime today. All these boomers calling to ask about this big tech company called Stop of the Game they heard about on Cramer.Waking up and watching thousands of retards comment live is how I start my dayI really hope this GME train is still goingWe are witnessing the destruction of the economy whilst getting rich from the bubble

What a time to be aliveCould you imagine having your money in a savings account right now and making -2% this yearAfter what GME did today, I’m no longer doubting WSB. Gonna get PLTR callsDuring the 2008 infinity squeeze of VW, short sellers at hedge funds were literally in tears on the phone as they tried to cover their positions. They described it as a nuclear bomb going off in their faces and were telling buyers to just name their price.



Can you imagine how amazing that must have been? Oh, right. We're about to experience it.The internet is fucking lit right now.If GME gets to 50 tmr. I will actually actually leave this place.Upvote for tendies tomorrow 🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔GME at open, full send from everyone expected.I will never doubt wall Street bets again.  I've been skeptical of all the gamestop posts here for the past month and thought you guys were delusional.  Who TF wants to go into smelly game shops anymore when there is a deadly virus spreading around and there is a much better way of streaming games instead of swapping discs now.  I still don't understand why it's up so high or how gamestop will continue being a successful business long term, but kudos to those who made bank, while I rolled my eyes at it all.ANYONE see GME today?If you think PLTR won’t hit $50 by March then gtfo. /r/investing is that way 👉🚪Made money on GME puts today. Dirty money. I imagine this is what it feels like to be a prostitute. .If gme goes up again tomorrow I’m giving everyone Reddit goldGME announced AOC will fart in mason jars and the jars will be sold exclusively in remaining Gamestop brick and mortar locationsWhen ARKX goes live I’m immediately throwing $5,000 at itGME GOING UP AGAIN FUCKKKKK IMMA BUSSYou can either go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy.

LONG $PLTR 🚀 🚀 🚀Y’all really made GME pop off. Proud of this sub!# Futures up after Bidens spending bill leaked, rumored to be $50 trillionIm up to 0.52$ per month on dividends!!!!!

🚀🌚🚀🌚🚀🚀🚀Did Mango get peached?**YO** congrats to all of today's winners (boss ass chad bulls every one of you) but we need to tone down the momentum of getting bigger in the public eye. Fuck Jim Cramer and his cronies, fuck the boomer army, fuck Melvin Capital. Nobody should want a shoutout or recognition of retail's strength though. The more tangible effect we have the more likely the sub gets shut down.

I’m also gonna skip work to do coke on the golf course Friday.

Balance is key.I think I just discovered poor mans margin lmao.

I saw a good play so I did an instant deposit that I fully intended to process, then bought weekly spy options and they started printing, so I used a day trade and cashed out.

Then I was like fuck it I don’t need the deposit now so I canceled the deposit in the RH app. They let me keep the profits.

For legal reasons don’t do this intentionally, RH should probably fix it or whatever.Palantir has demo day on the 26th. I need gme gang to transfer attention over on Friday close thanks 😊. 29th 40c

Edit: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀Looked at ICLN put-call ratio for today. Down the chain, the put volumes were .12, .14, .04, .21, and .52 of the call volume, meaning that there were 2-25x more calls than puts bought today. EXTREMELY BULLISHgf said she gets to peg me if I end the week in the red

what's the play boys? I gotta end the week in the redWhat if deepvalue is Cohen?Do you guys remember all the DDs, literally everyday, and countless comments everyday in the daily’s, about GME? And NOW, now look at yourself, scrabbling around, fomoing after a 60% day, wondering why you didn’t buy in, wondering why you called it blockbuster, wondering how much money you could of made if you bought last week...pathetic. 

Lucky for you the ride isn’t over, so fomo away retards.I won $4 in the Powerball after a $20 investment. Buy high and sell low in everything you do.Can’t sleep.

I found myself dumping in at market open and will continue to diamond hand it. Just remember fellow tards and singular tardette, you can be simultaneously happy for people who post insane gain porn, as well as be happy about your $100 return.

While noting that shorts definitely were a part of the buying binge, Ihor Dusaniwsky — the head of predictive analytics at financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners, which specializes in analyzing data on short selling — said he doesn’t agree that GameStop’s price surge was the result of a squeeze.
“GME’s board shake-up and stronger holiday sales is causing a long-buying tsunami, which is the primary factor for the price move,” Dusaniwsky said in emailed comments. “While I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today, this is much like the chicken-and-egg question – did long buying lead to short covering\squeeze or short covering\squeeze lead to long buying?”
Dusaniwsky believes it’s the former.
“We will not be seeing a massive drop in shares shorted over the next few days, more like a 10%-20% drop which would mean 7 to 14 million of shares covered, which is nowhere near the almost 70 million shares traded this morning,” the analyst said. “Long buyers are the primary force driving GME’s stock price up. “Sold GME calls last week for a loss. Missed out on 20k gain. Peak FOMO'd today, bought calls expiring 1/15 and then sold for 30% loss EOD lmao. I'm so fucking pathetic.I lost 700$ on GME today. AMATo everyone beating their chest because their mighty gains, time to dazzle you with a combination of confirmation bias and coming down to earth.

Wall Street is the most infested rathole of greedy cucks and a whole bunch of them are underwater on GME today.

They aren’t gonna take this lying down.
Today wasn’t a short squeeze, it was a combination of Cramer and Daddy Cohen.

Time and time again the short holders do everything they can to drive the price down when GME moons. Tomorrow will be no different. They are going to desperately drive this thing down because they have to. These assholes can’t afford to lose this big and remember fellas, the house always wins. They’ll break the law if they have to.

Expect every financial manager and Wall Street “expert” to shoot down this stock and recommend puts.

I’m expecting GME to dip tomorrow for this reason.
I took some profits today I’ll admit but only so I can go back in on the dip.

We ain’t done yet boys. Rocket ain’t even left the pad.

TL:DR Buy the fucking dip tomorrow!!!Can Tesla moon after hours pls it’s been a long dayCathie Wood filed for a space etf. Take us to the moooonMAKE PLTR GREAT AGAINRotation into everything tomorrowJust bought 200 shares GME for the fuck of it. Market value of exactly $6,420

Written in the starsTSLA consolidates for 3 days after having a 24% week & suddenly it’s a “boomer stock”.

You guys are a different breed of dumbThere was zero reason for anyone to sell GME today.Fellow GME gang

We might have another run up but please keep in mind that we will all become violent enemies of one another (taking profits) when shorts finally capitulate and close their positions.

But in the meantime, TO THE MOON.Lucid is absolutely flying. Whoever posted the DD for it I love you. Unfortunate that mods banned talking about it. Everyone could be eating tendies right now 🥴4 years of a private university. 9-5 for decades. Only to get beaten by idiots with too much money. Tough breakIT IS NOT TOO LATE FOR GME

THE SQUEEZE IS JUST GETTING STARTED 

GME COULD POTENTIALLY BE 100+ BY FRIDAY#YOU WORK FOR ME NOW GAMESTOPI clogged the toilet at olive garden lolWell, I’m retarded and officially done trying to YOLO. I’ve tried countless plays over the past year and every one has led to losing everything I have put into the market. All of them are my fault. I mean I paper-handed Tesla calls during the greatest bull run ever seen. I have been gaped by Theta gang, had many options expire worthless, and have seen my gains melt away because I diamond handed too long. I’m afraid that I will go completely broke if I continue to be in the markets.  Now I’m so depressed and poor with no income because I’m a graduate student. I’m not looking for sympathy, just venting. I’m genuinely happy for all of you who can do this and have something to show for it. One day I’ll be back. Until then, respectively, fuck you.I wonder how many GME players are banging hookers and snorting Coke off their tits right now. I’m here here with my PLTR eating chicken tendies instead of collecting them.**SPCE**

Fuck it, I’m outTraditional IPO’s will be less frequent and profitable as retail investors get smarter. Banks are milking the shit out of popular companies and will triple the IPO price by the time it goes live for us. Examples are ABNB AFRM DASH AI. They are pricing in retail investors ability to just buy immediately. Our only chance for a piece of the true value in a company in this current environment is SPAC’s.

They’re not immune to the ebbs and flows of the market, if the tech bubble pops it’ll hurt, but they’ll make some moves accordingly and come out the other side just fine.

**One week from today, Biden gives an inauguration speech. This speech has the potential to be a huge catalyst for obvious reasons, but most importantly green energy and steel. Green energy has recently been popping off, but steel has been flat to dipping in these most recent trading days.

Y'all are legit autists.Day in and day out I look at these threads and I see new traders asking about whether they should buy puts on a certain company. 

The answer is always, unequivocally and without reservation, NO. There is nothing less American than betting against a company in a capitalist society. Also, stocks only go up. 

I was fooled once and had a phase where I was bearish. I lost SO MUCH MONEY. I don’t think I’ve bought a put in at least 6 months. 

If you’re thinking that there’s gonna be a market contraction that’s fine. Don’t buy QQQ puts - buy SQQQ calls instead. In other words never buy puts.How the fuck do you pick winners?

We should focus our efforts into stocks we know are favorable in terms of short float.  Buy shares (not on margin) and wait 3-ish months.  Rinse and repeatTSLA recall is bullish AF. The recall only relates to the interior display screen which is not manufactured by TSLA and therefore is clearly a red herring that in fact highlights the manufacturing components actually produced by TSLA. 

But, perhaps the most compelling reason I find the recall to be bullish is bc stocks only go upIt’s shocking how autistic so many people in this sub are, we have been HEAVILY pushing GME for a long ass time and there are people around here who waited until the complete high today to finally buy in.

QUIT PLAYING GAMES WITH MY HEARTAnyone know Burry's cost basis on his GME shares? I think he bought pretty much at the bottom of 2019, if I remember right, so that would be 3.30. He has 1,700,000 shares. so if we take 31.30-3.10=28 then 28 x 1.7 mil we can see that Burry made 47,600,000 off of just GME!

“While I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today this is much like the chicken and egg question,” Dusaniwsky wrote, adding that he believes long buying led to short covering, rather than the reverse.

Dusaniwsky doesn’t expect a big drop in shares shorted over the next few days, noting that short sellers lost $968 million in 2020 mark-to-market losses, Instead of getting out, short sellers actually increased their positions.I feel like literally everyone in here probably has at least a little piece of GME at this pointWhere my goev gang at.

After a TSLA run up it tends to trade flat for 1-3 weeks. Occasionally it dumps bigly. Result is always the same, it will be flat/down for a couple weeks, then it will have a meme sun run again. It’s easy to tell when the meme run is starting. As soon as it jumps like 5% in an hour on a random Monday, THAT’S when you get in. But you HAVE to get out of your FD’s as soon as the momentum is gone or you will get fucking rekt. Trust me. As of yesterday, the momentum is gone. But it’ll be back.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 and 횬호너ㅓ온ㅍWhen you let the intern take charge of the futures quotesSup dudes,

So, i went to horseshoeing school in Missouri. The owmer of the school had a huge handlebar moustache, like Yosemite Sam and a huge belt buckle, cowboy hat and boots. 

One day come up to me to critique my work. He said:

"Hey Boston, you're doing great, but youre not taking your time to fully understand the material. Let me tell you an old cowboy story, and you cant get back to your work.."

"Ok, Boss" i reply. 

“Well,” he says, “the Young Bull and the Old Bull are standing on a hillside overlooking a pasture full of cows. The Young Bull is prancing around, all excited, and says to the Old Bull,

 ‘Let’s run down there and fuk some of those cows(bers)!’

The Old Bull just shakes his head. 

‘Nah,’ he says. 

‘Let’s walk down there and fuk all them cows(Bers)!'"

I remember this now and it makes me thonk about trading. Average into and out of positions. Keep your eye on only a few cows (stonks) so that you can determine how they move. And when you got a read on one, fuck it to death.

ARKXY'all know BETZ is an ICLN-tier ETF going forward, right?MARA BACK UP TOMORROW? 👀It should be a rule that everyone should own at least 100 shares of GME because 100 shares is a call contract so in a way it helps one call contract print I guess?

But we are not memeing sleep numberOkay here is some short term due dilligence. Without getting into the details, a group called Melvin Capital are balls deep in puts in the low 20s that expire at the end of the week and coming weeks. So they have to buy back to cover their shorts soon. Their problem is 20% is held by the board of GME. 20% is held by institutions. Basically, Melvin might be having a stroke right now. If you can hold for another week, you’ll see a lot of upside.

If you don’t buy the dip before buyden presser, you must hate moneyTrump knows he’s in deep shit cause he’s never sounded less retarded than this new videoIn 2018, I bought ZS first IPO'ed, JD when it was only $32, MTCH when it was only $35, ICLN at $9, SHOP at $115. Now ZS is $211, SHOP at $1200, ICLN at $34, and JD at $90. But of course, I had to sell them all to start trading IN WEED STOCKS OF AUGUST 2018. Now I'm at 95% loss since then, but if I had stuck to traditional investing or at least trade options in value companies rather than speculative stuffs, I'd be likely and very solidly a multi-millionaire now.  lmaoooo 

Being an autistic retard as I am, of course I had chosen to go all in in SPY and TSLA puts, April of 2020 :')

fuckWhere’s the recap guy? I miss him. I want his official recap of this epic day.fucking put in a limit-close for Feb 19 35c on GME. I have never been so depressed from making 200% gains...i had originally set the limit GTC close to 7.50 (bought at 1.70) but thought it was too unrealistic and planned to roll them into April. Had no clue the squeeze would happen this soon. Bought a 2D (this friday) 40c FD just incase this squeeze fucks Melvin so hard that he hangs himself with his own prolapse. Calls on $ROPE for Melvin⚰

Lets see if the GME gamma prints so I can roll a big chunk into april, and sell a shit ton of naked puts. 

*mandatory GME rockets🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀✋GME QUESTION✋: To anybody that actually knows what they're talking about;
Shouldn't we be going for puts eventually? My logic is the short squeeze will end, and the price will go down. So what should the move be if we're fucking idiot scum and didn't buy GME? Buy puts at the peak of the summit?Who here was on /b/ back in the day where we’d prank local GameStop’s asking if they had battletoads?Imagine not holding mad renewable energy positions right nowEveryone should be subscribed to u/deepfuckingvalue yt channel

GMEgood night mister ackman 🤗❤️Can we please make the stim payments universal?If GME brah u/DeepFuckingValue doesn’t have a position after his April position should that be. Red flag?I meet a girl once and she said she was like a psychic. She told me I would work from home eventually and that it was where I was most happy. 
  
Well at the time she knew I was in school for a career where it’s not typical to work from home. So what she said came out of left field. 
  
I laughed it off at the time yet here I am 4 years later working from home.With the number of stim they’ll be pumping out this year, it’ll probably lead to UBI, honestly.Missing out on all these gains is making me want to seppukuI saw a commercial on CNBC for the Lucid Sedan and realized I'm not missing the boat this timeI doubted GME the entire time, but I can’t help but be happy that so many of you guys made a shitload of money today.

All of the “sell” comments are always highly upvoted and tons of people commenting in agreement. 

Just a lesson in being confident in your plays. If you feel comfortable, don’t fucking hesitate.The fact that the vast majority of people who bought GameStop today were new buys and not shorts covering is beyond belief. This squeeze is going to be unrealSo with all the "stimulus" being printed (including what was just announced), they could've given everyone over the age of 18 \~$50,000. Can somebody please tell me why we are paying taxes? Really digging ourselves in a massive runaway inflationary hole.

Like its nice to make money, but sometimes I wish I could go back in time where I was oblivious to the world of trading and stonksIf the market is an MMO, WSB raided GMETechs opening red. Green by eodBanks have somewhere between 1/2 and 1/4 of gme shares as hedged vs their short calls and today sure looked like a gamma squeeze - banks reducing short as puts went oom, then buying stock to hedge calls as they went itm... so they may own half the shares!!

The problem is that when we sell our calls, they’ll sell those shares, and 17m shares (on 70m total shares outstanding) of in the money calls expire Friday. If those calls aren’t sold and are exercised, it’s a bunch of bag holders long shares and most people would rather sell their massively gained calls for other oom calls or options on other stocks. Could be brutal Friday and into next week, going to position short and ride it down the other way.

Again - it would appear the banks need to sell at least 1/5 of all gme shares outstanding (!!!!!) by Friday assuming normal dumping of itm calls. And if that moves the price, they have to sell yet more to hedge longer duration puts and sell-hedge longer duration calls. Stock went up 60% because banks bought a shitload of stock today because they had to.Tesla will kill tm but hope SPY rips up in hopes of stimulus and AAPL finally breaks past 131 lmaoWaiting on the old classic SPY calls to printWait, you guys are making money???Holding SPCE has me so excited for the morning :))))If fucking around with these FOMO stocks is too stressful just buy IWM or EEM calls for like a month out anytime they have a red day.I’m getting lucid ads in my Instagram now lolWhat tf does PLUG even do?Tuscan Raiders, when are we going to Mars?

So, with Biden’s energy plan announcement tomorrow, on top of price correction to come, on top of TSLA’s fomo, and it’s one of, if not the best future company to invest in....

BUY THE DIP. Easiest TSLA play we’ve had in weeks, maybe months. If you’re bullish TSLA and and you have the opportunity to buy before the correction, do it.

I know itI found it weird that despite GME mooning today, there weren’t any new options I could dump my money into, $40 is the highest for 1/15. Is that unusual?Cramer puts the sus in JesusSleepy Joe going to say taxes to rise will be the catalyst for the correctionTSLA $1000c 2/5 doubling down on the morning dip if it’s even thereFast forward to December 2021. The US Government hosts a dinner for the richest people in the world, in honour of this brutal year at the stock market. President Biden holding a speech about subsidies for EV's and Videogames, while Bezos (180B$) is jerking off Papa Elon (1.000B$) under the table.

Cut. Next Scene.

The focus is on Cohen's (10.000B$) face, who is rolling his eyes. The camera zooms out and we capture Papa Elon jerking off Cohen under the table.What’s the short float for PLTRSomeone needs to call up Melvin Captial and ask them how they are doing

Then post that shit so we can laughBiden has been very silent on China. Delisting no longer on the menu?SRPT pls fly againTSLA puts are such shitty deals. 

Even if I though it'd retrace to $700 this month and bought the 2/19 $800p for $61, I'd only gain 65% even **if** the drop happened.

Sure, if it goes to $400 by 2/19, that's a 12 bagger, but that's a pretty ridiculous bet.Tech futures anyone?

Question regarding today’s short squeeze and what’ll keep happening in the next few days:

Given that we’ve established that institutions and company insiders won’t be saving the  🌈🐻by selling their shares, given Jimbo’s call for GameStop’s board to issue new shares in a capital raising attempt, has anyone taken a look at how many more shares GameStop’s board is currently authorized to sell to the market before they need to call a shareholder meeting? 

Just wondering how safe we will be in terms of capitalizing on the short squeeze in the face of dilution but I def buy the narrative that the company would be better off waiting for a higher price before issuing more shares in a capital raise. Just wondering if anyone has an idea in order to calculate what the possible dilution could bring the current share price down to.

1/13/21, 11:03 PM
January 13, 2021 05:03 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News

One of the most popular names in the investing world for 2020 was Cathie Wood. The ARK ETFs were among the top-performing ETFs in 2020 and have become widely followed by retail traders.

What Happened: On Wednesday, Ark Investment Management filed an offering for the Ark Space Exploration ETF under the symbol ARKX.I'm honestly sad that $20 2/19 was the highest and earliest call option available 😢See See Ivy at $18, too bad you sold it because some greaseball decided it wasn't allowed on his subreddit... 🤡🤡In the fortunate position of 1. Owing a shit ton of cap gains and 2. Literally all of my positions are mooning.Everyone talking about churchill but they don't know about peter thiel btwn. They speed racing each other to 20Its crazy, I made more than I'm expecting for my annual bonus today, and all I had to do was sit on my ass and watch it happen.So you're sitting in front of your screen, cheeto dust all over your fingers like always, wondering why Canoo is moving up on the apple talks that didnt amount to much. . .apple wanted to buy Canoo but didnt, so why the big hype?  

This quote summarizes the whole sentiment behind it:  

[“Apple values innovation, and Canoo is the most innovative EV startup in the world”](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/01/apples-interest-in-canoo-underscores-why-goev-is-a-winner/)Jumia :)for real though why are these SPACs jumping afterhours?If TSLA coudl just get bakc to 880 that would convince me to stick around and help raise the kidsWHAT DO I BUY

Edit: congrats to GME holders, wish I was big smart like you folksShort percent of float for SPCE is 74.67%Whats the psth news? Got 3 grand kn callsI'll preface this with the fact that I'm still GME gang.

Can someone tell me why people think the GameStop squeeze isn't over. average volume is 8.6 mil, today is 144m, last reported short interest was 71 mil. There was twice as much volume as what it would take to cover every single short. The highest large volume puts were at 24$ . Price peaked at 65ish million on volume, which would be about where the large shorts would have finished covering.

Yeah, I'm still GME gang, it's still solid on fundamentals, but the squeeze is almost undeniably done, no? Maybe a smaller one when the last few shake out, but I can't see how it's not over. 

Also, people realize that IborrowDesk isn't all available shares right? Every single major short could have covered without making a noticeable dent there depending on how they went about it.LIMIT UP

LMAOGot to wet my beak on that GME squeeze todayIF we are in a bubble. Can y’all think of a better target than peloton(PTON)? Tesla would be the other option but way too risky. PTON crossed into a 50 billion market cap today.I want to increase my GME position, would it be better to buy 100 shares at open tomorrow or sell a 1/15 put?Curious, is there a reason no one has DD solar winds? I get that they are in the shit for having hacked software, but they just came out and confirmed that their method of distributing was standard as used across the industry. The stock has basically halved and it’s a cyber security company. As /u/deepfuckingvalue says pay attention to plays that have bad headlines but where the tide can turn.

>“While I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today this is much like the chicken and egg question,” Dusaniwsky wrote, adding that he believes long buying led to short covering, rather than the reverse.

>Dusaniwsky doesn’t expect a big drop in shares shorted over the next few days, noting that short sellers lost $968 million in 2020 mark-to-market losses. Instead of getting out, short sellers actually increased their positions.

Even though The Steel Don was banned, I’m still in steel. Keeping my MT calls, I do believe the squeeze will happen soon, everything he’s said has played out so far.

THIS IS THE TOP. RUN WHILE YOU CANWhat we think Tesla opening tomorrow at?**tl;dr: What are you going to do with your TSLA calls given the optional "recall?"**

Quick question for folks who have TSLA calls. There is a recall on older model Teslas. The stock dropped like $11 (1.34%) after hours.

From CNBC :

* The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked Tesla on Wednesday to recall more than 158,000 of its older Model S sedans and Model X SUVs, due to touchscreen failures.
* The recall effects 158,716 vehicles made by Tesla, representing around 10% of the company’s total vehicles produced through the end of 2020.
* The glitch is related to a memory device within the media control unit of older Model S and Model X Teslas-- the device has a limited write cycle, and stops working well over time.

This is the result of a formal investigation by the NHTSA into the same problem last June.

The Wall Street Journal says "Tesla doesn’t have to recall the vehicles, though NHTSA said in the letter that if the car maker doesn’t take the action it has to provide an explanation for its decision."

This from Yahoo News: "The agency wouldn't comment beyond the letter, which is a rare step toward a public hearing and eventual legal action. Experts say the letter means that Tesla has resisted doing a recall that NHTSA feels is necessary.

“It's obvious to me that Tesla told NHTSA to go pound sand, so what they're about to get, they've earned it,” said Frank Borris, a former head of the agency's Office of Defects Investigation who now runs a safety consulting business."

I have Tesla calls. I'm glad that this so far hasn't been used. as an excuse to tank the stock price.

Anyway, my question to you guys. Is this a nothingburger? Or should we be prepared to sell tomorrow morning before the stock tanks? Everybody is on pins and needles as it is with Tesla. Every $1 drop leads to the question "Is this when Tesla goes back to $400??" and people buying TSLA puts.

Not a financial advisor or professional. However, looking at the MACD we are still below the signal line although the MACD is moving closer to the signal line albeit very slowly. At the moment (looking a month out at the stock movement) we remain bearish and can expect a slow bleed until
The signal line and MACD line intersect moving it above the signal line. In a daily basis they are still continuing to intersect which albeit very rapidly and in short order which is why you see the momentum swings. In my opinion though it’s trending in the right direction to eventually meet a bullish price. I’m seeing maybe 24 dollars being the turning point, but there’s a lot of resistance at the moment even at the current prices.Futures mooningI've seen more comments tonight than I ever have that make me think the top is inLooking at ARK's trades today.

Better late than never.Tax man question I’ve always wondered about. Are the penalties of withdrawing from a Roth or 401k early worse than standard realized gains taxes, or the same?

For example - I put 6k in my Roth this year. I decide in November that I want to withdraw that 6k + whatever returns.

Vs

I put 6k in my standard individual trading account, withdraw in November, and ultimately pay taxes on the returns next year.

“Even if this were new news, and every one of the 158K SX touchscreens had to replaced, at a cost of say $5K per screen, that would represent a one time after-tax cost (and hit to the stock) of about $0.67/share. $TSLA is down $11/share AH. Get a grip everyone.”

However my puts were up most of the day and at the end they surged even more.  

I know the IV really determines the pice of the option however if the price of the stock rises by that much the most I could expect is to be flat or a tad up but def not have the puts appreciate by over 20%when will we know if today WAS shorts covering or not?fuck yeah Cathie pumping $SQ FINALLY!

https://www.caranddriver.com/news/amp33482352/sony-vision-s-prototype-testing/[deleted]So for GME, if the margin calls tmrw AM aren't as damning as we expect they will be, do we see a dump due to the failed short squeze?anyone playing apha earnings?Recall? Bullish. Tsla 900 eow confirmed.I was thinking of a hustle, don't know if it would be feasible in reality though.

Have 2 companies owned by the same entity pooling money basically. Company A buys houses via residential mortgages. Company B issues the mortgages and then sells them off to be packaged into securities. 

repeat the following basically many time over:

Company A takes out a 500k mortgage from Company B and buys a house in cash. Company B sells the debt (3.5% on 500k for 10 years) for 500k+, either directly or packages into an MBS (although maybe they have to sell to freddy/fanny to make it into AMBS?). Company B then shoots 500k back to Company A to prepay the entire mortgage. Company A sells the house for 500k or maybe it appreciated a little during this time - company A is a real estate company so doesn't really incur much broker fee. Or company A just sits on the house as an investment property.  Company B pockets the difference between the nominal amount of the mortgage and the amount it was sold to bondholders for. 

Bondholders here incur a loss due to the convexity of mortgage backed securities when they essentially get scammed after being sold a bond with expected interest payments priced in but then it is immediately prepaid and yields 0 interest.I wonder if Cramer got together with some old bodies and came with a plan to throw a little hint into a rumor that they know isn’t true.

Banks have to dump a lot of stock along with wsb autist savants selling these ITM Friday calls. Should pressure stock down for a quick gain.

Reason is most of us will have ITM Friday calls will entirely or partially sell them instead of accept share delivery. When you sell that call to a dealer they promptly sell gme stock to hedge. 17m shares of calls jn the money expire Friday. Lots of selling.

And dealers have a lot of other long stock hedge. They May own half the company at this point. Today was an epic short squeeze and gamma squeeze but Friday can easily be the opposite. What goes up 60% on technical factors like that can also go down just as fast.

Something like 70% of game purchases are digital and growing, with Microsoft owning Xboxes digital market place, Sony owning Playstations, and PC being split between Steam, Epic, GOG, Amazon and about a thousand smaller competitors. Even if Chew boy captures 100% of physical disc purchases, he is going to be losing share to digital purchases year after year. I mean, both Microsoft and Playstation have console without a fucking disc reader. 

There is literally a 0% chance GME makes a reasonable dent in digital purchases, and no one is buying physical games anymore. Over the next year or two GME is going to be a few dozen stores in highly urban areas barely making a profit and an innefectual unused online marketplace out priced and too late to the game to compete with the big boys. I see this as nothing more than some cowardly shorters giving up on a squeeze short term to a few autists and some empty hype.I have a few gme puts. For obvious reasons.
It WILL come down. There's no legit, long term reason it will stay as high as it is. All yall bulls enjoying your big gains, which is great, congrats. But how much are you willing to lose if you don't take your profits now. Just wish incould have gained on the ups, but im happy to gains in the downs. Gains is gains fam. Adios.Who is dumping at least half their Tesla shares tomorrow 🙋🏻‍♂️So GME Gang: you buying puts?
Edit: yo you autist, i was just asking. If you sell your calls/shares might also make some money when gme goes down[removed]We need TSLA AT $600My stalker doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. Ghosted me. Said she gets too attached. Only me 🙄Sell TSLA. Bubble confirmed. I’m serious.Seems like a lot of long term investors have been pulling out the past week. Interesting. Maybe you should buy puts guys.Rip Tesla bulls.Rug pull imminentIf you could puts on GME, no matter how far out of the money it is, would the IV crush be faster than any possible gain? ie its impossible to make money when GME goes back downCan we please make ICLN the new meme stock?Lord forgive me but I'm now a gay bear on GME.I'm completely new to investing

What are some moves to make?Hello people of Reddit and Wall Street Bets. My grandson has been doing quite well in the stock market lately. He’s been telling me about these gains he’s made in a video games company of sorts. I think it was called GamePlace or something. He said he made “tenders” today, which apparently is young people talk for a shit load of money. He’s finally got himself a lovely girlfriend that does not have another boyfriend and he said that he’s well on his way to buying his first Ferrari by next year, haha. To think the kid will only be 16. Anyway, he said this was a good place to come for investment advice, especially for some quick money. I don’t think I have much time left, so I could use some quick money haha. Where do I start?So is GME still going up, or are we gonna switch to puts? Asking for a friend.holy sht Apple shot up to 139Biden I need you to say word for word

“If you have puts on GME tomorrow, you’re in good hands. GME does not belong to be this high.”

Thanks man. Appreciate it[deleted]Are you left wing or right wing? And why?When does lyin Biden speak tomorrow?people who are bagholding GME need to stop tradingShorting $GMEWe finna drill

Fuck your calls chadI have a feeling that tomorrow is gonna be a big red day.I think this % change error is a sign that we’re about to have a black swan and give you bulls one last little warm fuzzy. Let’s drillGME puts are looking kinda nice. Any thoughts?Gamestop was a good holiday play. But the holidays are overGME puts at openBlood red tomorrow.[deleted]Ngl, I want gme to wipe people out. Get fukt lmaoHonestly, I would love to see GME crash and burn. Just to see losss porn 😈Can’t wait for GME to be cut down to size. All these Robinhooders chasing the meme bout to get burned.I like how GME holders think they made the best play and they are smart! Whereas, the fact of the matter is that they just got lucky with an announcement, nothing else.Ay whatup stock gang 😂 it’s your boy Meek Millah “Meek Mill”. I been in this bitch for a minute but am just exposing myself rn! Lmao! Hold up wait a minute, y’all thought I was finish!! Lmao for real!!!!! 😎 Ay “I never fuck Wayne I never fuck Drake!” Yaaaahhh dreamchasers babyGME buyers have to be some of the stupidest people on the planet, these people are incapable of thinking of themselves and form an emotional hivemind around a stock and shit talking anyone who dares question their actions. If you knew anything about Gamestop you'd know it's a dying and soon to be dead company. Everyone who knows anything about videogames knows that physical stores are dead in the water and everyone is going digital now with no need for a middle man.I'm begging please someone tell me how/where to buy GME. Literally $1000 would change my life. I'm not even sure how I ended up here but I'm so pumped and excited for everyone who did so well today. I know I sound fucking stupid but after you roll your eyes please tell a girl what to do!You have got to be one of the best mods of any space on the internet that I’ve ever come across.

Obligatory: long GME 🚀🚀🚀Looks awful, yet another L for zjzDo me a favor and remove my post from that, none of the gains are from GME and you killed all new views to a post I made trying to get people to donate to charity. Really shitty, of all the mods to see did this I’m sad it was you, you seemed like the person who would’ve seen my post had nothing to do with GMEprofit is profit is lolShow me the screens I wanna seePlease keep going I’m about to bustyikes feelsbad manThis is the kinda shit that keeps me up at nightif you keep thinking about how much you could’ve had... you will get sadder and sadder. it’ll tear you up inside. just think, theres plenty of more squeezes coming man :)Just hold palantir you’ll be millionaire but just have to wait for the run upBröther your sacrifice will not have been in vainshow the screenshots.  MakeMeSufferYou earned thisThank you for curing my FOMOf  :'(ouchI feel you, got out literally yesterday night (after 2 months of holding) as I tought this week was going down because the expiry of Melvin puts. Bought TSLA Saw +5% in the morning and didn't think anything of it, then +20% and was like ok wtf but focused on working, fast forward 1 hour later +60% and went all in, got out at around +80% after the peak (as I bought on margin and didn't want to end up in the red if it went below 60% again)

Lesson learned only focus on one thing at a time

Tomorrow, maybeWell both plays are pure phaggotry, if that makes you feel better?willing to bet $400 you won't make that mistake againGME is supposedly still going to pop up and squeeze moreServes you right, and thank you for your sacrafice.  Brokers have big data and know who you are. They knew you weren't worthy of the gains so literally waited to as soon as you paper handed.WSB totalgains and memes inc.Yesnot even, I am trading using my bank's website and pay $10 per transaction

still made bunch of $$$I've never invested in my life and know very little about it. I'd like to get started though. I am 100% aware that I will not become rich overnight, or next year, or probably ever. But I am an unemployed, dirt poor man with a family to support. With the stimulus check and tax season coming up, I have a few hundred I can afford to invest. I know that's not much but maybe, just maybe, I can make a little profit and slowly build it up and learn a lot along the way. What should I do to get started?Sir we are called autistsShut up you'll ruin itHere I am sitting here with negative gains on RH. I’m an idiot.Bag holding as well 💪No shit I probably would have sold yesterday. Madlad you a going to be rich as hellbe honest. do you yourself actually have 39C 1/15 and do you think they have a decent chance of printing?I don't see the problem. He's got two days. This is like \*maybe\* and outline, definitely not even a first draft stage.Not selling til $420.69

Edit: been shilling GME too much mods muted me60,000 shares after I exercised my 600 $19 options today.

I don't believe in the company, but I believe in you fucks, so I'm riding shotgun with you to the bitter or bigger end.

Or until it falls to 23Always. 💎🤲🏻. No matter what.Same here bud. Im a fucking idiot.I sold my 20c at 10am thinking I was making bigbrain gains 🤷‍♂️Our day will come. The thread will be full of PLTR gainsWhat if I told you today wasn’t even **the** squeeze? 🤣Also, announcement is tomorrow right?I have 2 35$ calls for 2/19. My body is ready.

I laughed when I saw people commenting that this was the squeeze.  We could see returns like today each day for the next 1-3 days especially if we find out there was insider buying.  LFG50 @ 25 because I'm not absolutely insane.I’ll admit I sold some PM because I wanted to divest from margin. I also didn’t expect it to pop **today**

Plenty of powder left 💥Keep going I’m almost thereYesDon’t get emotional and play the comparison game.  That’s how you lose lots of money.  Be smart, have a plan, and execute it.

Starting off is much harder.Sir, this is a Wendy's casino.Let's see how that strat works TomYea I've done very well but I wouldn't be able to replicate this with a 4 figure account. I theta gang though I've been interested in swing tradingHow do you figure out what’s in a dip and what do you purchaseSame with larger accounts and theta gang. You can buy and sell options on good stocks you don’t mind owning.  

Pdt and buying cheap options on meme stonks is the hard way to win for sure manIf its easy to 5% a day then it doesn\`t really matter what you start with!

Start with £1000 do 5% a day for a year, easy you say, see what you have at the end of it.5 dollars is like, a hundred times more than 5 cents. Whoa. 

🤯Yes, but I love the feeling that I myself am my own maker. I wouldn't want the money if it wasnt hard earnedCareful man. The losses are bigger tooDo you run the wheel and what is 6 considered 6 figures?

Like 100,000 enough?Now imagine theta gang selling some ccs on GME this week lolNo you fucking won’t. You’re one of us now.

Show a month of your returns. Then let's show a month of some rich fuck who has $10,000,000 in SPY and see who has a better return. This month that would be $330,000. Let's see your $330,000 return this month.[deleted]I have like negative 10% cashAmen. I'm astounded that more people don't realize what the Fed and the government has actually done to the dollar. When prices rise don't think of it as prices going up. The production cost hasn't meaningfully changed, you dollar is just worth less than it was yesterday.can't lose value if you don't have dollarsLol I currently have 122k in marginExplainCan someone explain margin and why this is the case?Nice plays king. I think P A V E is also a good play for the infrastructure billYeap we’ve gone downhill at an ever increasing pace.

Sold BABA 230p 2/19 to finance a calendar feb/March 300c.

Call spreads on Apple for earnings

LWBG leaps financed selling a strangle 17.5/35 for febGOEV: I tried riding the baby train with two calls, bought high, sold low, watched it rebound to where I bought.

APHA: Bought 5 12.50 leaps (01/'22). No doubt that will pay off, we'll see if I regret the entry.

RKT: Patiently waiting....still waiting. (13 June '21 21c, currently ITM), plus 100 shares. 

KTOS: Rode the best part of that wave, sold last contract today early, made money on all contracts (sold the others yesterday).

Now GME? I won't touch TSLA, but that might be the one to gamble on, can't believe what's happened.Ok ill go. GME 🚀🚀🚀🌕APHA putsI got into GMEGay postI HAVE BEEN ROYALLY GAPED BY X, NO MORE PLZwelp I am consitently getting gaped by VALE and MT, so I'm looking forward to this.

FCEL better pop tomorrow with his speech. 

Inauguration day will rain tendies from the sky.Valehalla?This is why I keep telling folks to get in bed with VALE, CLF, and ICLN. VALE and CLF will be the big recipients to Biden's infrastructure plan, and ICLN will only grow greener as the year goes on. These are long plays, April at the earliest for most; however, patience will provide us with a nice green payday, and we can interrupt our wives and their boyfriends wrestling session to show them our gains.

See you guys on Mars 🚀🚀🚀I can’t buy the X dip anymore after today🥴I’m all in on those 2 sectorsWe are also in a climate crises Biden, don't forget!lets go joeThe fuck is TM?I will be waking up at 4:15 AM PST to see the rocket launchIs that am or pmTried to tell people to get in. Got banned for 1 day lol.You can. I get fucked all the time.Buy farther out. Don’t buy when RSI is on the moon. Fail more but learn each time.

Or put it all in GameStop idkBUY LONGER DATED SHIT YOU FUCKING CLOWN. Theta dont touch u til like 45 dteWe wait for you to sell then we pump itLearn Greeks pick low theta plays usually a few months out but you gotta not pick shitty stockshold one day longerGet in on some of these ETFs and long play, also just make a rule to not hype buy unless you legit feel like you got in early.dont play weeklies or buy less so the 3 day losers dont hurt enough to make you sell


also most people here dont paper hand after three daysSell puts on things you wouldn’t mind picking up. If you get assigned. Sell calls on it. 

Or leaps. 

If you see a ticker in here 5-10 times. Calls

When you see it 50 times. Puts. 

And etfs. At least until we get a sense of how this is going to shake out. 

Just my strategy. 

I yolo profits on lottos. Have had some nice winners. 

Also lost a lot until I found what works for me. Losing is the tuition. Hang tight.Do your own dd and trust your position. You’re not going to be green on everything everyday, shit might be red for a week before you get a profit. Have an exit point and stick to it.Piggybacking off a few others here: if you're playing options, get at least a month+ out unless you are supremely confident of your play. Even then, it's usually better to buy closer strikes with more time.Bud you serious ? It’ll be ok1.  Get credit card

Report backYes stfuWe’ll likely have a violent correction or two this year.Easy mode about to get even easier with rotation into travel / manufacturing / energyYup bubble pops normally come after a vertical spike, consistent with dot com, south sea, 08 housing and even tulip mania I've felt uneasy these past days, I feel like we're on the precipice of a massive fucking dropIt will end but it could be years before that happens for now enjoy the ride. Don’t forget Marijuana stocks.Scared money don’t make money I guess, keep riding the wave and know when to cash out!Agreed been way too easy these 8 trading daysNah you’re right mania like this doesn’t last long. The problem with bubbles is when it finally pops everyone thinks they are buying the dip but then it just keeps dipping, they buy more, it keeps dipping, and in a matter of weeks you’re wiped out. Experienced it first hand during the c.r.y.p.t.o bubble of 2017/18. This will end the same for most of this sub.Already filmed the landing in a Hollywood basement.What's the symbol kind sirIts not confirmed yet tho right? Still bought them anyways 🤣 i ride with my retardsI did some digging after I saw it being throw around and felt the vibe. My calls printed AH. Excited to see what I wake up to.I sold at 14.60. Good times.GMLess risk. Long term more exposure. Why own ARKK and not Tesla?BlasphemyI used to say this about iwm and it's fucking up 25 percent pre covidSoon you'll amass a portfolio with all these booming stonks and then you too will have essentially a clean energy etf. And then you will wonder why do I have all my money in 5 stocks when i can have 1 booming stonkIt's an ETF lmao and had back to back 8% gains when Dem's won Georgia (that's crazy for an ETF). Expect this etf to do extremely well over the 6 months, esp when Biden actually announces his plan, etc.It’s the safe play for green energy, as QCLN is. It’s an ETF, WSB expects it to moon like a meme stock.You're in for some free money.💎🙌🏼90 eowSomeone bought a fat stack of $40 calls for Friday https://i.imgur.com/Rm5oOdR.jpg100 EOYYou’re good Boss.Same. We’re both good. I ain’t selling.Practically all of WSB is rooting for at least 36.Sorry man*everybody missed this joke*same day onlyI think it’s about a year as a minimum. I use the term with anything over 6 months thoughNo you just jump over the first expiry date on Robinhood aka u leap over the first oneA month of two is a pretty good leapsIf you are not gambling, never, ever buy options that expire in under 60 days. Once they get to 30-35 days left to expiry, close the position and buy again for a further expiration date. Don’t hold them with less than 30 days left, again, if you aren’t gambling2 weeks is close as hell lol.Leap is a year or greater, I believe.1 yearThink it's anything over a yearWhat?  Why would you do that?

Are you bagholding?Always has been...I would be tooLol why dude they just hyped it up for today and tomorrow will probably will be sell off dayWell how many shares?37.me tooDon’t be. Tuesday to Valhalla. No paper hands.hopefully only one shareHow do you fucking sloths wake up so late? I see comments like these all the timeGME more likely to hit $950 than TSLAAren't you the guy who wouldn't eat out the fatty because her cooter smelled like cheeseburgersLet us know before market open tomorrow morning. TIA!Wait, isn't it as simple as: what am I thinking today? Okay, do the exact fucking opposite! 

Literally can't go tits up!Maybe don't go into something after 5 consecutive green days? Just a thought.Sounds like you're jumping in after multiple massive runs.

Try doing it for stuff with just an initial run.Buy at the top

But do it before it's at the topI only caught Plug, bought in at 20$ and am still holding. Have you sold already?Lmk what’s next because I’m have the inverse effectthey were 500% at the peakA nice house. Serious think about it. 300k house paid off completely. Only bills are utilities. You can live off of 300-500 a month. You can quit your day job and walk dogs or some laid back chill shit with 0 cares in the world cause you got a roof over your head permanently.

Once the new presidency is settled, and especially if covid news gets too stale and goes away, its possible that climate change will become the main star again

Obviously America loves to hear news about our self-perpetuated doom, and green energy/solar/electric vehicles could be the rotation for that news cycleWhat about a longer term perspective than this week? I’m guessing you see potential if you haven’t sold yetBig upsiesyupi have 10 grand in MT calls

smhSame but my calls are a bit further out. Steel gang shall rise againI blame Robinhood LOL f themiv crushThe premiums are insane on GME. End of week near the $$$ options would need to move 20% for you to break even on a straddle basically.i did a straddle for an hour today on GME but then got too nervous and exited both positions for a lossI’m a newbie with options (or rather I’m a europoor and can’t trade them). This is obviously a very good hedge. What would the downside be if say it goes one way or the other and one becomes worthless and the other rockets up? Can’t someone theoretically do this for every trade?> You can buy both puts and calls on GME. It’s called a straddle or a strangle depending on the strike prices.

That was just excitement, this has hype + actual technical reasons why it will continue to explode.There is a 100% chance many of the buyers today have no idea what IV is.

That's too retarded for even us.The store buys it from Heinz. So it’s a sale.Their 500k delivered meant an end user purchased themTsla’s business model is direct to consumer, so the dealers are not separate businesses like traditional car dealers. Aka the car hasn’t changed hands until it reaches the consumerThis gets into the details of revenue recognition for accounting *shiver*Where is this? Tesla doesn’t have dealerships.They Dont have dealerstesla sells direct to consumer it has no dealerships.  if a tesla delivery center is flush with cars those are waiting to be delivered to those who bought themBasically that means that your car has been dropped off at the store. And is waiting for you to pick it up. Tesla doesn’t use car dealership they are direct to consumer.Hopefully it included buying lucidI had the same dream... timestamp buddiesSoftIt's not a bug. USA is now called Zimbabwe 2tbh depends on the paper hands. either way itll recover eventuallyYour fucked cuz all the attention is now on GME so TSLA might not get any pumping soonA recall doesn't mean they lose sales. A recall means they offer to fix the shit for free.


In this case, it could just be an over the air update, or replacing a memory module for a fairly cheap cost to the company.


I cant imagine this actually impacts anything during market hours.? What you talking aboutWorth between 1 and 10 dollarsExpiry?You’d think not a big deal. It’s like maybe $350mm for a company that’s raised $10B+ recently. Who knows though, would be equally unsurprised to see it moon anyways or eat shitWhat they do raise some cash?Depends. You’re trying to lose it right?Factor in cap gains tax, unsure if you bought in Jan 20 but if you bought between then and now you’re most likely going to pay 2x ST cap gains tax as I assume gme wouldn’t be a long play.roll it into the next TSLA.

me autisct tho....it's not a bad idea. strategy that has worked well in the past for me is buying spy calls 4-5 months out at close, selling the next day at open. historically, spy gaps up about 80% of the time. and with calls that far out (don't necessarily need to be leaps) almost no theta burn if you're wrong and willing to hold an additional dayI haven’t BBC yet eitherYesBecause it’s undervalued as shitshort squeezes incomingLady Cathie75 daysI have five $10c 1/15 that I got for 9 cents each that will absolutely print if ENG somehow has another big day.I asked this once.

I'm optimisticShort sellers were down $812 million in mark-to-market losses for the day, according to S3’s Dusaniwsky.

“While I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today this is much like the chicken and egg question,” Dusaniwsky wrote, adding that he believes long buying led to short covering, rather than the reverse.

Dusaniwsky doesn’t expect a big drop in shares shorted over the next few days, noting that short sellers lost $968 million in 2020 mark-to-market losses, Instead of getting out, short sellers actually increased their positions.That’s the idea ain’t it but 🤷🏻‍♂️It will be a boost to all commoditiesWhy ?NeverHell nah TSLA only goes up youll brush off those red days and never look backIt went up 4.5% in AH.

Melvin won’t get margin called like retailers do which is what causes crazy infinity squeezes.  They can take their time and offload their positions more slowly.  I’ll wait for he short interest update after the weekend but my guess is it’s majorly covered.IV kinda high rnThere’s so much IV that’s been injected today that GME is gonna have to pull off an even crazier stunt than it’s +99% intraday high for calls to be worth it. If IV dies down, long dated calls sound good otherwise shares is the safer route I think.https://imgur.com/a/u4jRycY

Chart is looking a little bearish, but given current events this could easily swing the other way especially since the MACD has been below the signal line for a while. It’s patterning down based on 1 month view, but could reverse. RSI indicates it’s not overbought. Not a financial advisor or professional but I predict a bearish morning maybe drops to 90 light swing up tomorrow to 92-93. Not a recommendation to buy or sell.

Notice the MACD trended above the signal line for a moment this month which could be a bullish sign.How that stock still gets bought is beyond meBy proxy.

If you were gonna fomo in at $38 just stay in. The DD and Cohen stuff was set in place for free money, days prior. 

Play with less money, it's a lot easier to play this game when you're playing with an amount you're comfortable losing. If you're making $7.50 an hour. It sounds like $50-100 at a time is plenty.

Yolo'ing $1500 at a time is a lot easier when it's a few days of wages. Not 200 hours of work. You're playing this game on extreme difficulty.You're too poor to be doing stupid shit like this and I'm not saying that to be a cunt.

I have two trading acctsA single order should only count as one day trade so you’re fine unless you already had 3just turn off notificationsLook into Ghetto Spreads.  Basically, you buy a call, profit from it, and when you're ready to lock in profits, you sell the call right above the original call you bought.  Doing this will turn your position into a debit spread and you can close the debit spread the next day.Yeah I’m holding through earnings tomorrow as well.

Steam (Valve) has a monopoly on PC gaming storefronts that is only being slightly bitten into by other independent stores (B.net, Epic Games etc.). There's no place for Gamestop there.

Then the fomo kicked in .

Then it went parabolic... 

Then some shorts were covering I've no doubt..

Just the beginning.There are literally 1000 posts about itNeeds a catalyst too.the way i imagine it, theres a lot of big players in on gme starting today, so retail investors are playing against more than just melvin/shorters.

i think its pretty likely a bunch of us retards bought calls from mm's today, they keep it flat for a bit to iv crush the shit out of call holders, then let it moon and reap the profits of holding actual shares.

or maybe it just hulks out immediately, who knows? idk how to check how many new call positions were opened up and sold today.R/investingYou close the position for whatever P/L?rough day for me mostly, but got a couple AH runnersI think it pops when they announce stimulus/infrastructure plan hopefully tomorrowSecurities will be bought and sold.

If you don't do either of those things, sell it on Friday.

Then turn off options trading, learn the Greeks, learn how options work, and come back and try again.Well hope to god GameStop hits 40You should have sold today, at least do basic DD about options before dumping money in. If GME is under 40 (likely a little higher) all your money will evaporateHold til Friday afternoon ✅✅✅You’ll be fine. We’re gonna blow past 40 and you can find a exit that you’re comfortableThats a short time frame for 40, I’d exit that tomorrow if I were you. (Maybe wait until noon to see if it goes up)Bro youre fucked why would you buy so far otm expiring so soonYou should just stay committed at this point. It a literal lotto ticket now.

If it gets profitable at any point between now and eod Friday sell it and then go learn about options, theta, IV, and the other Greeks.Sell them and buy further out. Id wait til around 1030 to decide if it was me. Unless of course it shoots off like a rocket, at which point...

Dr.PP messages me privately with insider information32.80Bruh I'm not sure but I think that's illegalRight here SECYou’re kinda obsessed with COVIDDo itI bought two, just to see if I get luckyI'm no expert but if you sell premiums then you miss out on any future leaps past the strike price, if you exercise the option then you just own the shares and take advantage of any upside or downside that ensuesPrice = intrinsic value + extrinsic value (which is >0)Options have extrinsic value (the purchase price of backing stock will not change) in the stability offered and intrinsic value (the difference between the strike price and stock price). If the option is not yet due to expire, it definitely has some extrinsic value in addition to the intrinsic value and therefore may not be worth exercising compared to the sale price. Timing for dividends and/or taxes will also impact your value difference between exercising and selling.As far as I could tell depending on how much the premium was and how much the stock is currently at, buying 100 shares are the strike price could be way better. To some, just taking the money and running is better than gambling it again.it's coming here bitch, look at the SEC document posted todayWhy the fuck are you pumping this ticker so much bro?pump your penny stock somewhere elseSqueeze hasn’t even startedRide into the sunset...

With that said.... Tsla, pltr 🚀🚀🚀I DID sell my 1/15 24c yesterday🥴I do have, I think it’s a 50/50 chance. If this is really a short squeeze tomorrow should be a decent gap up, nobody sold and everybody is FOMOing shares at open^Exactly, analysis says this was not short covering (entirely), rather accumulation.My broke ass has 1 $30 for the same day. Hoping this will make me a little money to play with.What is 2/19?I've heard 4/16 $45c without any DD involved.I was at lunch and saw 2k go poof. Still made money though on GME. Thanks to y’all.Should have opened it at close for the morning gapI’m just looking for reassuranceThe man would've had such a fun life if he never got into office. 

Celebrities and the media liked the guy and his business antics and shows.Is it smart to buy a 1/15 call at open tomorrow if I didn't have a call before? New to this so sorry for noob questioncallsIt’s true, she’s pretty cool.No, actually it’s all true. I guess what she said was verbatim. She brought up Robinhood and Nio herself.

Hmm, unless she’s wealthy from suing people, then I may have a problemPuts on your dadThe mans Nostradamus he called a million dollar play a mile and a half awayWhy FridayWhy FridayRespect the cathie baeWhat does tsla have to do with space?New providenceBecause it is fucking easy right now, everything is fucking mooning. A couple bad trades, couple of emotional trades off the back of that and you wiped out.  That\`s how people fail.Do DD on a ton of different stonks and build a ghost portfolio of stonks you like but don't actually own. Keep these in  watch lists.

Study basic Technical Analysis to understand basic support and resistance. You don't need to understand any of this in depth, just enough to be able to have a feel for when something is at/approaching these levels.

Then just scan your watch list and see what's red and what's green. If it's red, quickly assess why it's red. Scan news headlines and comments to get a general idea. If it's an overreaction or simply profit taking I feel pretty comfortable entering a position. 

If the entry looks good (based on basic TA and your gut feeling) go ahead and open a position. 

Enter the position with about half of what you intend to use. Use the second half to dollar cost average into the position to decrease your average cost for your position and also get an idea of whether or not the trade is going your way. Keep an eye on it for a bit and either take profit immediately if it works out in your favor, or set a stop loss and check back later.5% plays are more exceptional and require more planning. Yeah if you try to 5% every play you'll probably fail. The idea is to make a ton of 1% plays and win more than you lose. You're much more likely to win 1% moves than 5%. Save the 5% moves for well-planned plays. And use stop losses.I lose money when over-confidence leads to over-leveraging. I've been humbled and blew up my smaller account a couple of times and can't imagine what it would be like to blow up my larger account. Definitely proceeding with caution.6 figures is 100k and up yes.

Only do options if you got a decent amount to throw away as acceptable losses. Don't go into debt like half the tards here. 

Shares are safe long term choices, however on days like today you'll make $300 instead of 3,000, but that's still 300 bucks a day man. 

Stay in but be conservative.$39 😇Ayyyyebro, get your future son a new daddy 🚀🚀🚀While your gf sucks the f out of PapaI don't have the free cash for this.About 6 months ago. Every month is consistently like 3x the dow just following what people say on here and on youtube.  I'm up 150% in that 6 monthsBest answer I can findLol its not hard to mitigate risk. I joke about the yolos. Mostly just get shares and cut underperforming stocks. EasyThis right here.

My Grandpa money is in my retirement accounts. Anything here is just playing the roulette wheel to knock years of the career.That's not an argument if the guy had 150% returns in 6 months he'd has 25 mil instead of 330k I guess you're saying he doesn't need that money or somethingThat's made up math. Memes are way better than 50/50 if you're paying attention and you can mitigate risk easily.This is the way. Currently using about 9k marginAmen.

Given the current environment of what seems like endless money printing, stimulus, effectively zero interest rates etc I think you’d have to be an idiot not to just stay long equities.Purchase sell puts? (since I don’t have the shares for sell calls)Calls on TULIP, got it.I went thru that 2017/18 too. Still a big believer in that but this sub ain’t the place to talk that. 

Regarding the equity markets - I feel like money has no other place to go for the most part given the current environment - endless brrrrr, massive stimulus, zero interest rates, bonds essentially zero. Why would money not want to be in equities?😂See see ivCciv 🚀🚀🚀See see I VCcivNope just massive rumors. If they confirm it will moon even moreOk well you win this round knicks94 but, i just think that icln is grewt but it is almost opportunity costIcln will go up. But it will not habe those 20% AH and gap fills that older clean energy stonks haveThere will be gainz for sure on ICLN.  But in no way is it the best clean energy play. Throw a dart at any of them and you will have more gainz.Which is great. But that 8% was only made possible by a few of its portfolio holdings mooning like 30% 

Just encourage making a clean energy watchlist with icln at the top. So you can see the movements within the sectorIm just saying, make a clean energy watchlist. Then tell me ICLN exposes you to the gains in that sector every dayI’d quit my second job honestly, only working it to pay student loansYo what app is thatEomYea this is not what I was goin for😭 kinda wholesome though that people are trying to be helpful lmaoI know you're joking but anything above 6 monthsBecause the squeeze is yet to start babyHeckCause the squeeze hasn’t even happened and I wanted to be in on it.

Definitely close margin since I don't wanna get calledI had 19.50 GME yesterday but sold a day early.  I do agree, at this point I'm just tilting and am trying to close the red with whatever big play I can think of.  Not really the best judgement in terms of what I'm laying money onStill holding my shares with an average of 20.40 lol.  PLTR 300 shares at 25.90.  To be fair, I had GME yesterday at 19.50 and sold at 20 something.  Literally the reason why I'm hating myself so much because I could've just held an extra day.  PLTR is the worst though.

You probably thought the same thing of GME yesterday? Go back into your gaybear caveGive these white collar family fucks something to watch over the next few days.  We've all been dying for some excitement in our livesOh yah I'm definitely not discounting the possibility we get wiped outIt🚀🚀🚀🚀I’m pretty much dead right?I've got OTM ICLN leaps, just don't think we should expect the gains from last week to happen again this week, or even expect much gains this week at all, and same for next week, for the clean energy sector.[deleted]ICLN is above 6B already no?hope that starts tomorrow. i positioned my portfolio for a continued clean energy rally this week and next and so far its been massively disappointing.What strike?Why lolI think the price movement outweighs IV crush on this stock.I’ve noticed when stocks like this supernova they either keep going or they come down hard. I’m betting on a 20% move in either direction as opposed to a 0-10 in one.Lmao ouchNo real downside if it goes enough either way, but you would make less money than if you didn't make the opposite trade. (your profits of one leg, cover the loss of the other leg)

If GME doesn't move, then you can lose a good bit, since both sides would be hitting you.You can. The hope is that it moves so far in direction it outweighs the loss of the other. 

If the stock price doesn’t move and both expire worthless you lost on both sides. 

Given how much this is moving I’m in on it.It needs to rocket/die enough to overcome the high IV crush AND the other end of the strategy...Only buy in if you think GME is going to have another super moon day or it'll die so hard the next day, otherwise, you're just bleeding to death because it isn't doing anything crazy.This is the kind of dd I look for hereYou know what they say about short squeeze’s... best time to buy puts.

Yes you are making gains, but you are essentially just clawing back a currency which will probably be -30% at some point in your life.I actually agree. I don't think anyone will dare to raise them. 

Read OP again 🤡Something about how much distance you can cover per gallon of gas.Yep they announced it. The stock moved like 2% after not moving for like half a yearCC👁VLucid Motors.I mean that is true. Sometimes even the indexes are red but the stock trades green. So I guess you are right it is a guesstimate. But I sware 9 times out of 10. Big red = i'm in danger lol. At least that is how it opens. I'm more than aware that sometimes it can open down 2% Then climb up to green in like 30 minutes. It's insane to see, i love it. Man im hard now even thinking about it.Yes, that is the information we need to know.Stock but I mean it would be the same either way lol. Up is good down is bad unless you a bear then you are extinct.Thanks bro. This is the most helpful. So basically Chasdaq big red = I'm in danger. got it. lol

It triggered the bump up of a few dollars like every Cramer mention does. Than I believe a few shorts decided it’s time to cover which gave the mega boost. GME has been strong with support levels so far and it’s been increasing every time. From $11 to $16 to $19 than $20. I see a strong $30 support but at the worst I see $27 at the lowest. 
I also don’t expect the short interest to have gone down much. After the price went 🚀 the shorts def reopened positions from the peak expecting a huge crashDo you know what market caps are?Sightly different market cap.That’s how much it ran up when the previous consoles came out. Albeit, it was short lived. People will spend a lot more on games when new consoles are out. I think it’s just a bit delayed wit the console supply issue and that there aren’t even any new games out to sell.BULLSHIT!

That 55 resistance on DKNG is heavy.Almost had the same happen here. I been playing DKNG since mid November to moderate success. Made almost 20k on it in November, but currently bag holding it for the past month. I had 40k in calls for 01/15 55c which I sold at no loss when it had that run towards 55 before dying completely 3 weeks ago. Those calls would've been worthless today, so I got very fortunate on that. DKNG been super frustrating since November tho to trade.“Old news”SameBest post in this thread. Wish everyone got it, but they are probably paper.Yeah I believe 1T is priced in currently. But if Biden really does introduce a 2T package, there will be a lot more to price in the near termNot in office but treasury notes already priced it in and futures popping off right nowYou fall into the 99%. It’s okay tho.gme has nothing to do with russellI have gold but i have 700+ in cash balance left so im not using marginim calculating using ah movement using the total day gain. literally cucking me 500 makes no senseI’m still getting used to Schwab’s platform.

You can go long or short the stock can move 25% on either direction and you wound double your money on the way up and also won’t lose it all on the way down.  

For everyone who made a killing congrats u really didn’t think I would pump as hard as it has.  Might even go much higher but it needs to retract and form a base.  I won’t even add more puts it will come to me. 

However FCEL and unlike PLUG that one really is a shitty stock and has gone up ridding the entire clean energy train and have nothing to show for themselves.  Triple down puts on that onedope, i didn’t sell but i just think considering worst case scenario is goodno, bulls are in the bull trap phaseTake
Off phase got itLooks like itLmfao what the fuck is this kid talking aboutCan you please explain how calls work. I am new to investing and I see calls mentioned all the time. TIAMy worry. My dumb ass thought earnings was AH tmI know I made 30k on GME todayI got in at 12 but sold today. 
The thing with sharing a board member is beyond a stretch since that happens all the time. The LinkedIn post about jobs for sec compliance tilted me to believe that they may actually go with a direct listing or ipo rather than a reverse merger. I hope I’m wrong and people enjoy the tendies but this spac rumor hype with no follow through has happened before (look at the bee gang)Thanks.

As other poster said its up, ive been in and out this week made 1.5k i think, on Tuesday thought the price action was crazy so I got out, but the retard strength proved me wrong, thought it would pull back today after it peaked so I bought a put at 7.5c Jan, retard strength proved me wrong again.

fool me once, fool me twice I yoloHow far did he roll them out?PLUG has nothing to do with EV..Stimulus checks will probably pump popular tickers.Oh I thought it was at 10:30 my badalways knew i liked herThis seems most likely.

Noticed large volume buys exactly at close 3PM.i must not because i figured buy side pressure to nearly double the stock price would be it.oh myoh yeah just looked at the short interest and it actually increased today.  Might throw a couple hundred bucks into it tomorrow then.thanksI got calls and a lot of them exp in feb which I bought at the top at around 27-28 on dec 28. Have some may calls which I bought at around 23.35c feb & march calls which I bought before the blood bath at around 27-28 on dec 28. I have a lot of these.

Bought some 28c feb calls & may 35c calls in the 23-25 range😭🥺Won't ever be poor either 😉I’ll take that as a noI’ll take that as a 10/10How so ?Oh good call. 70s was a good era for film here.  Enter the Dragon, Superman, Saturday Night Fever...

It didn't disappoint either.yea, I really don't want to. sigh. nevermindthe light-up-box in front of me said that the TLRY merger is falling through. And if that isn't enough, have you experienced an APHA earnings? They have shit the bed -20% at earnings for the past 3 earnings. At the very least, I'll open up and I can sell if my tiny little pee pee can't handle the heat. The 6.5 are a stretch though.

Sounds like a selloff to me since very few people will accept delivery of stock. They’ll instead dump ITM calls and buy oom calls or other things. Lots of selling.

Gme is like 70m shares outstanding. 15m of net selling is huge. It’s also why the stock went up so fast today.

Are mortgages being handed out like candy to the point it’s concerning? Yes. Does it really matter? Not yet. Most of the people buying homes haven’t lost a cent during the pandemic and are just taking advantage of the low rates. Sure I have wealthy clients who none of this applies to but the average middle class person who hasn’t been affected is going to be okay

The real concern or catalyst when things might head south is when the lien or mortgage/rent forgiveness is over and then people start being evicted or foreclosed on and then you see an influx of supply. But as is, the demand can’t keep up and won’t for a good while. Basically in gridlock for multiple reasons 

TMI and this isn’t directed at you, but tired of every shmuck out there saying this is just like the housing bubble. It’s notOr maybe the low interest rates made homes a lot more affordable. A simple 1% difference in your interest rate can make a huge change in your buying power.siTesla worth $8 if we being real broBut these are ITM... I don’t have the shares if they exercise theseI meant can they do it a third timeI’m bent over doggystyle daddyAt leastFor real... Made me do a double takeMy bad. $GME $50 EOW 🌝🌝🚀🚀🚀🚀Forreal let him miss outMoons as wellI do like the idea of pivoting the entire stores into something else entirely and using the backrooms simply to ship product out of. Selling more board games, cards, and hosting lots of tournaments could be a great way to increase foot traffic, especially if they can strike a deal with someone like WOTC. The boomer investors on the board may not bite such an expensive and risky play though, overhauling all that space, and having to suddenly get liquor licenses and bartenders and such.


I fail to really see them selling different electronics would be too helpful though- radioshack proved Alibaba drop shippers and Amazon have you beat every way.Obviously gamestop was way over shorted, but I think after this rise of the weaker shorters closing their positions, there might not be a whole lot left to ride on.EaterYeah but how can you be sure volatility will decrease?

Also I’m in there! Can we get a special GME Claire. I want to stand out as retarded and unique.I’m not flexing I’m trying to get you greedy fucks to donate and what he did shut that down. 

It doesn’t matter though someone donated more after me so the ball is already rollingYes it did, no one seemed to click on your post to scroll through the posts in it everyone just went past it so you killed all the posts you lumped in there. Not a single view after it got chucked in there, people didn’t like it, please remove my post from it.

I’m not mad it’s just frustrating that you ruined something for charity.

I have no clue why you decided to put my post about a donation inbetween 90 GME gain postsI made a Robinhood acct a cpl years ago but never did anything with it. I can't remember what email I used either so I cant log in or create an account. Is there another alternative to Robinhood that is easy to use?

EDIT-I found the email. GME hit $38 today and made a lot of people rich. But it started going down again. What reason is there to believe it will go up again?Sold my 1/15 21 call yesterday 🤡Doh!1/15 40C at open tomorrow? assuming gap up isn't immediately in the morning and i can get filled at decent pricedamn imagine being able to buy calls

*cries in Australian* (no Robinhood here, I use Stake)The 19th day of FebruaryI am cash settled so it takes a day. But today put me over 25k!! Yea boi🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

33 rockets there for you my guyFear no longer my friend! I too sold at 33ish, bought back at 32, sold at 34, bought back at 31. Legit didn't know what to do. But this is NOT the squeeze. To cover all shorts takes about 2 weeks. Today was boomers getting in and a small amount of shorts covering. This is just day 1. Welcome to the showi think trump played himself with his narcissism, positive feedback loop out of controlNo, it's a terrible idea.  IV is **massive** right now you're going to pay out the ass in premium.  Buy shares.Awesome, just don’t teach her about this place! Don’t want anyone’s grandma reading the language on here, lolThat’s the day shorts will have to cover their shorts by. So they will need to buy shares at these elevated prices for them to be able to return the shares they sold :)A lot of puts expire fridayThe 1/15 contracts if some of the shorts cover to squeeze moreLots of puts expiringWhat does tsla have to do with IOT, Payment methods, block chain, and streaming media? Nothing. Yet it’s the top holding in arkw.Thank you I lost 2 grand in May from stupid options purchases and just started looking into more responsible trading for some side money.What tickers do you run the wheel on?

Is there a selection criteria or whatever the next wsb meme isI know theta gang wins most of the time, but how could you make money as theta gang on GME this week? With calls in particularShit, I sold mine (accidentally, I made a stop order higher than what I wanted). I’ll have to hope they get leaked to PLTR holders.😂Recognizing it is the first step to recovery 🤡Well that makes me feel better, but still only the winners are posting today. Our time will comeYou should’ve pushed that another weeku will be fine. It will go to 39 tomorrow famIt will catch up to youBecause that was only possible in 2020 and god willing 2021 that shit is not normal lmaoI wanna see you swing a few 100k into a single meme stock some idiot on the internet with $800 in his robinhood came up withIt really is pathetic. We're the most prosperous nation yet we can't feed our children. I used to volunteer at a soup kitchen and whenever I'd see a kid come in it would fucking break me. We could end hunger in this country tomorrow but we're more concerned with military spending and crony-capitalist deals. Sorry, I'll get off my soapbox nowHaha I believe the opposite. Christmas sales in emerging markets and Europe prob got hit hard (unlike US consumers, the rest of the world is a bit more rational and won’t get credit for things they don’t need and also increase precautionary savings at this time). 
One thing I am bullish for them is the new chips are fucking amazing (I tested a Mac Pro the other day and even the programs that were being emulated were running at ludicrous speeds). However, I think several people will wait for next iterations (denting this years sale expectation) since a lot of important software for developers and scientific programming isn’t properly supported yet. My guess is that it will take a year or so for developer to make native ARM versions and that’s when you’ll see a lot purchases of the high margins MacBook pros with dedicated gpusI looked at the past few earnings and it tends to tank. But obviously this time around there’s the impending merger to contend with. So this might have been a 🤡 playbest news I have heard all-day ✊🙏🚀I feel you, but I would encourage you to hold till next week at the earliest. China is shutting down for their New Year holidays, and that is affecting the stocks of these companies. There are also MM's impacting it, trying to get rid of the paper handers; however, there may be a fire to this smoke that is blowing, and we can see what the market will be like in the next week and a half.

If CLF and VALE continue to dip after Biden's infrastructure speech, then we may have to reallocate to new plays. 

Vito got the boot today for Market Manipulation, and I'm not sure how I feel yet on it. On one hand, I trust his knowledge and takes on the market. A lot of things are lining up for a great play here, but then there is the elephant in the room. With all the links, viewpoints, and Dad's given to us, there has not been a single post showing his positions. Like I said, I doubt he is manipulating the market; however, the lack of a screenshot to prove he backs up his speech is definitely getting to people, and I don't blame them.

Either way my man, cannot wait to go to the moon with ICLN 🚀🚀🚀Jesús Christ it’s surprising i make any moneyi pretty much did just that and im happy as a clam. There's always a way my manShort GME?It’s a high scoreGotcha.  It doesn’t let you place a limit order for extended/after hours?You’re fuckedHmm, maybeI'm sitting on the sidelines of GME now for a while, I'm just glad I sold my calls at a good price this morningSo.... Should I buy 1/15 calls tomorrow?Buy near ITM

It's a 50/50

But can be an easy 400% or 0 

FB is the most undervalued stock right now in the marketYes.This is the waySweet! I’m going to load up on itWhen does it go live?Thanks, fam ✌️Yup gotta get them tulipsYeah you’re right about all that and I don’t think the party is ending anytime soon but I also don’t see how we can possibly keep the pace we’re at.  Algos and institutions control the market and at some point they are going to pull the rug on retail.I heard today that Lucid also opened up some SEC, and stock market related positions in their company, looking more likely tooOther thing is IV on the individual stocks is crazy high.  Like everything else you listed is at 140-150% for at the money a month out and ICLN is 75%.  

That’s a lot of IV for an ETF but relative to its holdings it’s IV is much smaller.  Yes you get stuck with some shittier companies in the holding but you get to ride the bigger holdings at a cheaper cost.Thats cuz they have tesla as the big holder or theyre in only one type of energy (eg TAN is only solar), too much in one basket for meHmmm you could be right. But also just look at the past performance of it as well. In a month it has risen 9 dollars. That's pretty darn good, especially if u got in a bit early with a shit ton of calls (mine are up 100%, i'm sure others are 200 - 300%). U can say plug brought it up, but eventually it'll go down and those other holdings that went down will go up as well.Unusual WhalesYea it went right over my head lol. But I didn’t want you buying 2 weeks calls thinking you’d be safe.GME peaked today with 100% gain.

Holding during a 50% drop makes zero sense.Well you’re already holding those bags lol but what are you buying tmrw? 😂I mean those are all winners.  Hope you have shares thoughI bought XLM (last week?) at 0.12 and sold at 0.16 thinking i made some good cash, only to miss the moon to 0.42 one day later 

Also, im very new to this sub. What the fuck happened to GME and why is everybody so emotional about it?No way!? 😂

I always thought the E63 wagon was fire but Highkey thought girls would think it’s v 🌈Then I’d buy some MDMA and jerk off.Big time! Congrats!De donde eres carnal?Your store has led the region in biggie size upsells, Mr.... Assistant Shift Manager!!! 🥳. It’s a lateral promotion pay-wise, but you’re gonna be set for life on the management track, eventually. Congratulations, son.that's a skillOk... was about to plan on buying SPY PUTSI can only imagine.  Saw/heard a U2 take off once, sounded like a space shuttle taking off.  Couldn’t even talk to the person next to me it was so loud even from several miles awayPlat in everything except threes which I'm gold 3 bc I get matched with the shittiest team mates. You?Fluctuate between diamond and champ>We all make 6 figures and we've been stuck in our fucking houses for a year. This is as close to entertainment as we're getting right now.

Holy shit this is the best description of life this last year I've heard.

Obviously - same.Are you confident that any of them won't hold it against you if they lose their capital?Imagine having enough capital to take advantage of trends and make money.  Stay in school and one day you can get a big boy job too!Wow you are retard. Can't wait for people like you te get wiped out. Will probably happen in less than 6 months anyway.doBetter off jerking off to your sister.😔Bro it has a market cap you fuck wad check it. I understand it’s an etf so it doesn’t have a valuation you fucking retard. Get out of here with that normies bullshit get a flair you dumb shitOn RH it says so I guess but not TOS. Regardless it’s going upjun18 30c

im retardedDelisted MT on MondayTrackingCashier at tendie townYou can look up my posting history to see if I'm serious or not.
I also have another account where my YOLOs are even greater.Yes. (Is that what you want to hear?)Fair enough, you do you my dudeIt’s not priced in?Lmao I respect it. The cars look dumb as fuck though.Ya why outsource when you can have Detroit ghetto slave labor 🤣Deep sea?They write shit code you’ll be fineDude any retard could’ve made money this year. I made $30,000 day trading Amazon all day (no PDT) and I’m very conservative with money lmao she literally puts her positions out for the public to pump. It’s not going to beat passive funds in your 20 years.My overall portfolio is 75% VTI, 20% VXUS, and 5% stock picking/options/day trading to scratch that itch. I’m very happy with this.They're serious yeah, but they're also fucking retarded. I couldn't in a million years see GME, as a mainly physical retailer, have enough success to scrape past MAYBE $60. 

But the fact it came this far makes no sense, also look at retard strength stocks like TSLA, PLUG etc. 

Anything is possible in this RobinHood timeline now.Yes, and there's a million GME DD posts on this sub that explain it more than I'm going to.Yeah they would be but IV is crazy high right now so you’ll be losing money when it calms down. Leaps are fine if you are deadset on calls but I still recommend shares😂 I dunno if you’re joking or notWell... that's why your account is gone. Stop gambling.Yeah it is , gme weeklies would have printed but they could have also gone to 0 like every other week. You just never know , it’s gambling . Some people time it right and think they’re master tradersIt’s not impossible. If you bought before today, cool. If you bought today, still possible, but ballsy.Can't recall ever seeing that high of IV, so never. I see 256% IV for 1/29 calls and it seems highly likely to print.By far my best call from when I first started this game. Dkng has printed heavy for me, I really wish rh had a screen to show how much you've lost or gained on an individual tickerICLN is fine but TAN is better imo. I'm split roughly 50/50 with leaps on both of them right now, but may move more into TAN soon. Biden's plan focuses bigly on solar, not wack ass hydrogen fuel cells that power forkliftsWouldn’t be surprised if Tesla is at 1000eomDude. I have failed so many times. It took me months and maxing my credit cards to finally make it one day and understand how this shit works. If you believe in yourself, double down. Don't be a pussy (unless of course you really suck at trading, then just work at Wendy's or something, idk)🚀🚀🚀🌕

Hope vito unbanned soon.

Its crazy mods hand out big bans for the  tiniest things sometimesYes you fucking retardThat could be anywhere from an accountant to an engineer to a nurse to a kindergarten teacher. Gonna have to be more specific.I am, I feel I got a decent position on this one to.Get the LotR crew out there asapshietmakes sense, they living in that upside down lifeYou’re not wrong about thatThey don't expire, they convertHold it 1 more day then if anythingPersonally I’m holding till Friday but if you want to lock in gains sell at open when we start out rocket to 50. I also like the idea of you exercising your calls 😂Exercise em like DFVAbsolutely would've sold today but tomorrow shouldn't be bad eitherDang dude a $535/contract (if you sell at the current bid) isnt anything to scoff at. We’ll likely see some more movement tomorrow as more short positions will be looking to close.


Take your profit when you feel comfortable, or  if you’ve got massive balls roll the sucker up and out and out to a later expiryThis isn’t **THE** squeeze just a small one, likely combined with insider buying, compounded by day traders resulting with what you sawThey’re not retarded but the thing with IV is, it’s basically like momentum. 


It could keep squeezing, but if it stays where it’s at for a few days, IV will go down (not too much imo given everything going on with the stock rn but still..) 

When IV goes down it will impact option price negatively. 

The options have a very high chance of losing money moving forward if GME is not able to maintain IV.

The stocks are more likely to get more gains since they can stall out for a few days and keep marching no problem.

Obvi tho stocks will have much lower return than call options.

It’s risk/reward, you decide what’s best for you!


TLDR: If I was you I would sell calls and wait for IV to drop and buy back in or wait for share price to drop to buy back in.Thats. My. Dog.75 shares checking in just cuz that was my buying power ah yeaterdayMeet me behind Wendy’smine too. i have a 850/860 spread so im obv nervous. def gonna dip tmr but i dont think u will be that fuckedoh you’re fine thenWill do commando 820 putsThere’s some real weird shit up thereI definitely do. I think there's going to be a little bit of Battle Royale with many of these companies because it's really saturated but as long as you stick to ETFs and maybe one or two stocks it's only the beginning.Idk mabye there's another catalyst, but if there's not I might sellNo asset performance. Do you really think plug can make enough h2 cars without an h2 mandate?

First Solar is sold out to 2023. They cannot increase manufacturing to match the earnings.i dont think it shows whether they covered or sold more, but i think overall there was a change in 33m short positions, so at most 33m covered. BUT could also mean 33m more shares were shorted. Honestly i think some covered and more shorted.Someone shorted at 86 and then rebought at the end of the day with continuous pressure. Flushing call holders. Bear raid.Just looked funny to me but what do I knowHaha first of many.  When her ETFs stop going up and start going down 5% a month she won't get fresh money.  When she stops getting fresh money she can't pump her positions.  When she can't pump her positions whole market is f'd.  It's coming soon.  Get ready.Go further out. I have 15c Jan 2022. Wait for a dip and jump in.I mean, I'll take it but realistically it'll be 25 end of year. 

I mean knowing us retards well probably pump it to 50 by April with the whole merger going on.I know bro, but its Elon. Never doubt the Muskbuy puts thenIf tsla stock went down based on car faults it would be at 0 by nowhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366What are calls ? New at this trading thing2020*The visa deal was acquiring it for $5.3 billion so I can’t see them valuing it at $20+ billion nowokayDollar is reserve currency and until that changes there will always be demand for it.

30% less makes American exports more competitive. 

Biden green energy deal will create a new revolution like the tech revolution a few decades back.No homie, that's mph or miles per hourAAPL is boomer stock. They’ve between $126 and $130 for so long I get a headache looking at their chart.ThanksDown is not always bad, it’s dip. Look at the chart.My leaps certainly hope soI hope I am wrong. I have 4 97.5s...Calls on the M4 thenEarnings call on 29th + a catalyst tomorrow. Be patient.Haha! Yeah, tomorrow probably red then. I wouldn’t be surprised if nothing happens till next week or eom.Lmao, I'll bite.
Tech sector may be going down tmr due to sleepy Joe's speech. Tech down, boomer up and then if you want you can get outta your positions. I'm holding some leaps for steel gang but yeah we'll see what happens.No X but have some steel. Scared with you gaizHave you checked out vito’s sub?There's a catalyst tomorrow, but short term it's hard to predict. The fundamentals haven't changed, so I am holding on to my position. But it's money I'm happy to lose if it doesn't work out. If it is a yolo I recommend against it.R/vitardsGot what wrong? Gene expression is highly statistically significant but not that effective when checked clinically, Indicating it is less likely the case that the single gene target editing cures the disease. I think their result justifies the drop as it affects future studies.👽Yeah it was like $0.87 at the beginning of today. $1.30 now. It could go up or just crash and die like a true penny stock but hey, i grabbed 500 shares for funsiesYes.If you figure out when earnings there's no way it can go tits upThere was no other catalyst? How about the Ryan Cohen news on Monday you fucking retard. And before you say “that was two days ago” look at the last jump GME had when RC upped his stake. It was a few days after he did. Cramer caused 144m volume today? No, no he didn’t.I am not smart enough to know if the short squeeze is over, and I wasn't implying that I think it is over. That's just why GME is up so much. There was no news or other catalyst today is what I meant.

I'm hoping today was just the retail puts and shorts trying to get out, and we still have a squeeze on institutional positions coming. Also saw someone say there's 200,000 call options currently open with a 1/15 expiration. Apparently Melvin Capital also holds 51,000 puts expiring Friday. If that is all accurate, then I don't see how the squeeze would stop.Both. Calls a month out and shares. The more capable of diamond handing through a drop you are the more your mixture should tend towards calls. Bought 16 contracts because I'm almost certain it will gap up tomorrow when even more short sellers rush to close their short positionWelp getting same calls as you tomorrowAgreedI only play stocks like a nerd. I need the sleep tbhRobinhoodOh shit why didn't you say so. Ur good. In fact double down. But for real. IDK. I am trying my best to play meme stocks on the rise not ones that already have gain porn. Food for thought. Cuz then again TSLA never stops and it has a library of gain porn. Pick your poison.When closing a short position, you need to “buy” the shares that you shorted. 

So if 50% of the float is shorted, and the price rapidly rises, the people who have shorted the stock need to take massive losses to close off their positions. This can result in margin calls which forces the most over leveraged shorts to buy, which raises the price and triggers more margin calls ect. It’s a spiral.There are definitely some zombie companies, and SPACS and IPOs are making little sense.  But the ETFs are buying plug and TSLA so it’s not a bubble in that respect.That’s basically what I said.  But the stock market won’t crash, the dollar will.  As for when I picked the timing- it depends what currency you are comparing too.Which is good, the higher percentage short the more of a break out it will have.  I’m deep in callsIf you’re on Twitter I recommend following @traderstewie

He’s been posting charts in DKNG a lot this week and is very bullish on it.  He’s been hitting a ton of his calls and it’s been benefiting me greatly!thats weird dude.  Does the total value add up though?Cars is what got them to where they are. Lucid should be 100 EOY atleastMmm speak dirty to me ... So my 1/15 are safe ?stop don't say that. Not when I bought the fucking dip

also, buyden is speaking tomorrow so 🤞the world would make sense

Amazon and Walmart gotta be absolutely jizzing themselves though as they execute their warrants lmao40c 1/15 will make money... just not nearly as much as it would have with lower IVOh yeah. I'm going balls deep in ARKX in my real accountCheck out the weedsubreddits. I’ll try to find a link to why I think APHA will beat expectations... one sec

bullish short term options positioning has been holding the market upI’m in 1/29 860s. Wish I had bought them tomorrow instead of today.Earnings Coming up 😎🚀I only have 200 shares. But I sold calls on them and now I’m regretting it. So I dunno. Which I had more free cash to buy more. But the rest is in apple calls feb expiryI worry about pullbacks on a lot of these clean energy stocks once people realize some of them will never be profitable.  Best case scenario for FCEL for example is to be bought out by apple.Chances are really low an option will get executed if it’s not really close to expiry date even if it’s ITM at the momentOofThe fact Apple went with Hyundai is just a true sign to get out of Apple imo. They've lost all innovation and their attempt to jump into the EV game is joining with....Hyundai?  And years later than so many other competitors that will already have EVs on the road?  I doubt AAPL will tank but it's never going to experience that true EV bump we are getting right now with other EV stocksYeah, it's been a rather odd week for steel. Someone I was talking to said it was trading at a slightly lower price. The LME had rebar trading at 660 per tonne on the 8th and it has gone down since then and settled at like 634ish range. Similarly scrap is also down since the 8th. I'm not sure if that alone has caused this drop or if it is MM making moves.Gonna open flatI’m just using Tesla killer as an example of how this company can steal market share. Tesla will still dominate the market and maintain their dominance if they play their cards right. 

But, if you were to ask any experts on which companies have the potential to compete with Tesla, you would find a consensus agreement on Lucid and Rivian being at the top of that list.I think he means the c. cap rumors are just that right now, rumors. It’s not public yetI got in at 13.28 on Monday, sold on Tuesday with cold feet, back in at 15.37 today... can’t make up my mindThanks, just saw. Will move money from HZONIt’s old news. They already started repairs since NovemberI have calls aswell, we megafuk maybeYou son of a bitch I'm inCalls buddyThere's an app bro.The more pressure we’ve got on the short position the higher it goes. Grab calls if you want but there might not be much for sale when we open.Sell 30c FD on every spike, it’s free moneyThen whoever they buy them from will cover...Oh yeah I've seen this recently I think. Don't know exactly, like some said, collateral requirement changed under the hood is my guess. Or perhaps raising cash via exiting options "loosens" your marginThanks man, ggs. You played really wellIt’s a long term buy and hold so if you must, buy physical gold or silver.

But if you want something long term I would go w/ bcoin and get in when it dips to high 20’s low 30’sIf Apha tanks, Tilray is deadNo. It’s Thursday morningWtf there are penny💩stocks and then there is this bulllllll lol good luck though!hope tomorrow or inauguration speech does it. otherwise im fukfor being under a certain market cap

My risk tolerance keeps me out of TSLA since the splitChrist up 40% last monthDon’t do itHopefully soYeah that’s my best guess as well but who knowsWhen’s lock up ending?Try to sell a couple cc and see for yourselfI bought some today and also dumped them within the hour. I wouldn't hold on much longer my guySell at market or set a limit on it for the desired gains. I would watch this if you can and see where it goes.

Try looking around the sub for 5 fucking minutes before coming at me with swears and all caps you absolute troglodyte.he told me this story years ago but if remember correctly it was like 300 bucks. they drove him to an atm and said either go get us cash or we’ll take you to jailI knew it didn't look right. Its a word I don't use often. If anything, it should confirm my confidence in this decision. I'm using words I don't use often.Oh yeah if you got kids or any dependents you shouldn't be on this reddit lol, this is for those of us who got fuck all to lose lol.[Don’t do it, you are loved , love your wife’s bf ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5871910)Hey I’m not trying to time the bubble. Idc about the housing market yet I’m just saying it’s a bad signHmm thanks for the inside DD bro I don’t know much about the housing market besides what I learned in my property classThank youYeah it’s gotta be a big pivot to really justify the current value and to stay alive. Maybe they can buy sega and make a dreamcast 2. Or buy a stadium to host conventions and tournaments.


I kinda see hangouts, e-sports, and e-sports betting as an avenue they could go for growth, like capitalizing on the potential for the social aspect of gaming. Though I dunno how easy it is for them to expand beyond retail.Have faith in the one true god GME ..Der ganze Scheißhaufen ist total überbewertetLegit, ark has over 10% of some of its holdingsExcept squeeze hasnt really started yet looCheck out DASH similar situationWrong. I'm a millennial gamer and I will never not buy physical copies of games.Idk i was just fuckin aroundHow do you know people stopped viewing it?I don’t have the facts facts but from what I’ve read, most people who invested are holding on till Friday.Dude GME is a done. Try something else that has more potential. And If your going to use robinhood then learn how it works first and dont risk a lot of money on your first couple tradesI don’t know man, I would wait to see how high it wakes up toI'm doing it. Fuck it.Gonna need a recount on this.Y?Ay inefficient tax gang 😤Thank you!I just put 2 limit buys, one for $29 and $30 on RH. Is it best for me to just do their market buy right now and go all in instead of hoping they fill?So would a 40c for 1/15 be insane?Ah, good to know! ThanksIs that just the way it works. Calls and outs expire in Friday’s?Robotaxi network, mobile app integration, tsla cars connect to the internet.

Are you retarded? TSLA has 0 to do with space. TSLA has plenty that are connected to the internet technology.Oh man, it varies. Over the course of this last year my most profitable trades from the top of my head have been plug, dkng, czr, pltr, nio and all the similar ev startups, aapl, rkt, spacs, etc. And other more stable things, but the idea is where it's okay to play some of these meme stocks, you need enough money that it's not taking up a huge amount of your portfolio. Which is why it just doesn't work with small accounts, eventually you gonna be bagholding shit that popped and you don't want that on your whole portfolio. But I'm more than happy to only get a couple hundred a week on meme stocks, the shit adds up heavy, in part there's luck here but I've gotten alright at reading the momentum of a stock and when to not touch or when to exit a position. Sprinkle some call buys, usually couple months out, especially on shit you're wheeling that you want some of that upside on while you sell calls that will be assigned if it moons, in there for fun gambling money and life is goodSay you got assigned on an 18p gme sell you sold for $100, you turn around and sell a 20c for this week for $100 or whatever I'm just making up numbers, it obviously moons to the 30s, you made $400 off of $1800 in 2 weeks. Obviously less than ideal in this situation but it's still a winIf you want to become a BFT holder im hearing theyll get them for sureOur time?!!! I’ve been waiting for my time since mango man took office!! LMAO!It is though this stuff has been happening for decadesWell if the guy on the internet was rational and had reason to expect the stock to go up soon  it's a much better investment chance than the 3% id make that month on the dow or nasdaqOh I hear you. It's up to us that don't need that whatever stimulus to help out our friends neighbors that need it more. We need to be good stewardsHmm. Interesting take. Definitely didn’t consider the euro perspective. Seems like you know a lot about this tech and are making good plays off it, which is why I don’t really touch tech anymore, hah.A potential legislative catalyst though. Almost everything tanks after earnings lately, so I bought before right ER in case they have something amazing that’ll break that trend, but bought far enough out where the buzz around the dem senate voting on the MORE act should take effect and pump the whole sector. This was a risky play, but I certainly put a lot of thought into and considered their post ER performance in the past. I’m also only in a few contracts tbh and don’t really care if I lose it all.

Tbh though I did expect it to be down today going into ER so that was a 🤡 play and I should’ve bought yesterday.Calls on your ways 😤My friend did this in Thailand. Granted he's into trannies, but hes living the life of a king. They apparantly love white foreigners there.And lose even more?!!! Just like the Tesla shirt sellers?!!Bro $200 can’t do muchTy for the ideaBut... but wsb controls the market?🤨Eng. Mtrx. 

IV shouldnt scare you out of a play bro. What makes you think it wont go higher than 150%?U seem IV om somr shot grts to like 5k% or moreI had gains from icln. It is a great etf. But when you dig deeper into the clean energy sector, i think it is not hard to find 'undervalued' tickers. Because wallstreet dont know how to price this shit yet. You cam find tickers with huge volume and low stonk price. I believe this is the precursor to big moves in underlying. Look at average volume ans then daily volume. If you nltice one has high volume compared to its average, along with big % gains it is probably gettimg bougjt institutionally. As eng and mtrx are rn. If it is a bubble, those shits go everywhereYea there’s some pretty dumb people here, I guess it’s hard to tell what’s satire and what’s serious now lmao. Thanks for lookin out ✊🏼What caused the rise is stock accumulation, not the short squeeze, which means the short squeeze is yet to startYou must be new here to the moon 🚀🚀🚀I blinked and it dropped from 92% to 59% but doesn't matter because we're hitting 100Good point lol.  Most likely just gonna be watching like squidward from the sidelines.All shares.  Guess just bagholding for the foreseeable future.  Will try and get my PLTR moved before the lockup ends though.

You are making yourself out to be awful odd aren't you just slating people and giving 0 info back on why... Do you even understand what's going on with GME? Look at my post history..

The gamble is whether they merge with cciv thoughThey’ll outsource anyway. They don’t want those pesky US laws. It’s a farce.Yeah offshore oil platforms in the north atlantic...he said he would rather be homeless.ok boomerWhat I don’t get is - is it solely due to the shorts or is there actually perceived value in the company? (Does it even make a difference for stock purposes?)Thanks I’ll go with sharesyeah but to maintain that IV we'd basically need an even bigger day. which is beyond ballsy imo. when is the last time you saw 400% IV lol.right but I said I was talking about FDs  

either way, it will be interesting to watch.Best call as in call options or best stock you've purchased? How many shares?I was gonna do a $1000c 2/5, but I am nervousHAHA I do well with gut feelings and news, but I always get so greedy bro. It’s like 1-2k is NOTHING when u trade and you don’t want profits. If I work on that I will be better, just the initial outlook right now with depositing more money that can go into long term stocks and such ya feel?We’re fine with it.

Palms are getting sweatyThank you very muchI'm still learning and can't fully answer, but you basically buy an option to get the stock at a later date for a certain price, but you have to hope it gets to that price or you lose. It comes in bundles of 100 shares. It can make you more money and is more risky. I wish I knew what I was doing, because this one feels like a good play, but I'm sticking to share buying/selling until I learn more.OPTIONS when you bet on stock going UP, PUTS when u bet on stock going downThat's what I'm saying. The Visa Deal was agreed on a while ago, we don't know the growth of the company since. We do know that they've expanded rapidly. As a market, fintechs have been increasing in value like crazy. Admittedly, I'm mostly talking out of my ass. We'll just have to wait and seeAckman wanted a minority stake in a company.. if the Plaid deal was $5.3 billion and PSTH has $4-$7billion he’d have the entire company.Spot on. The problem is that artificially inflating your currency will negate any potential for your exports to become more competitive.

Your federal reserve is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any move in either direction will fuck shit up - this is why they've resorted to just continuing to print.

I'm genuinely curious to see how this all pans out.Shit. My bad! 

Miles per hour of gas!There are very strong rumors they going public via spac and will be making luxury EVs.O i mean just as a general rule. Sometimes I like to look at futures and go great I lose money on open today. I do know that dips are natural and healthy for a stock. It's not money until you sell it right lol.

There are even times when the futures are bright green red and certain stocks don't even move. Those are my wtf days where i stare at the screen staring at the stock and yelling WTF MAN GO UP.I’ve been playing AMD since it first hit $17. It can trade sideways for months and months and then all of a sudden it just takes off.How much did you pay? Expiration?As the CEO indicated, the placebo groups got messed up in a 1 in 250 chance, due to older patients.  So the results weren't statistically significant for the whole study, however  "*-- In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline --"*  from here: [https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-announces-top-line-results-part-1-study-102](https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-announces-top-line-results-part-1-study-102)The analysts just saw "statistically insignificant" and called it off.  They didn't dive into the details nor hear the explanation from the CEO (read the Barron's article). Maybe I'm missing something?It took 1 day. And it bumped it up to 21-22 which it alrdy did. And Cramer mentioning the new board members gave an extra boost. Which brought in more day traders, scalpers, FOMO folks, etc all adding up to the insane volumeI'd put them far out (not weeklies). It might take some time for this mishap to be seen.Let's get those tendies! Spread the word, the institutions want to get it back in at a low price. Good luckI just started with this meme stock shit, I’m in on ICLN and that seems like a safe, but slow burn. This sub has been screaming about PLTR for a while and after what happened with GME I figured fuck it. Hopefully in the future I’ll be able to find meme stocks on the rise, but for now hopefully the bandwagon takes me to the moon 🚀🚀🚀I honestly think what is fueling this might be option writers hedging their positions, you can match up option volume to teslas stock price going up and works exactly with plug and nio and all of the hype stocks[deleted]I am on twitter and I do follow him. Hopefully he's right on DKNG.No that’s the whole problem the total value is not adding up at allNo tech and energy is what got them to where they the cares a great sure but the they are a tech companyWhen is he speaking? I hope we print together broI mean don’t get me wrong I had calls for the run up. We’ll see if tomorrow ends up being different 🤷🏻‍♂️Why so?What’s that mean I’m not sure what that mean exactly. I know usually after earnings shit either drops or remains consistentTim 🍎's wet fart on a Tuesday morning has more actual revenue than TSLA and all those EVs combined.Ok lol I don’t own any but that’s not true 😂this.Exactly, idk why they released it today. They prob wanted it to dip. First it was the 1st responder battery issue and now this. They are begging for a dipGod guess we’ll see:/I feel like we would have dipped more tho tbhU don’t think there’s gonna be a big run up for demo day?YepExcellent. I have calls on APHA and TLRY. Hopefully they print (more) tomorrowGlad i bought ITM for once. I learned my lesson from OTM PLTR calls. Godspeed good sir!Shares can’t hurt me!I don’t think I willWhat if it goes past 40 tomorrow? Will that be enough to overcome the theta?That man also has contracts expiring on Friday! Did he not sell??????Wait you’re actually recommending selling puts on a short squeezed stock, I thought you were joking LMAO. I’d rather just buy some calls instead of risking $100 for $2500 collat. Theta gang is really not the strat rn anyways.lol gme was at $20 yesterday what do you mean it has no chance of getting assignedWhat an astute observationYou’re his personal google nowI ain’t mad lil homie. Just was confused. 

I just make people tendies for free, I’m a hard guy to hate.Reeeeeeeeeeee-call.God speed bro hopefully ur plays hitBoth those are using old data, you absolute troglodite. They both use the bi-weekly short data. As you can see they both list the 68,130,000 from 12/31, with Short Interest appearing to use the most recent data released early, which is still days out of date.

ShortIntrest.com says it's 20 minutes delayed because it still updates volume and days to cover based on volume. It's not 20 minute delayed short volume you moron.Unfortunately, you’re very wrong. You would have been right not too long ago, but the story has changed. I’m not here to convince you otherwise; I think you’ll just have to see for yourself where GME goes in 2021 and beyond.Well, I am 36. My kids are 13 and 17. I partied and did drugs during my teens/early 20s and never went to college. I am an incredibly hard worker and I have exceled in every position I have ever held. Unfortunately I have some pretty severe anxiety that has cost me countless jobs. I've done fuck all for my family and children financially. I have nothing to give them or help them in life. They are amazing kids that have literally never been in trouble, they treat everyone else with kindness and have always been grateful for what we do have. They are intelligent and do well in school. Every time we get our tax refund we just catch up on bills, buy clothes, repair the car, etc. Never saved money. So this is my attempt to maybe finally give them something. If I lose it all, it's not much different than every other year. Thank you for the advice though.I thought we agreed on at least another 2 years of bull market!Sure thing man. Here to learn (if you can call it that) so had to jump on something I actually do know 😎Bruder alles ist überbewertet aber das hab ich mir auch schon nach der v recovery im März gedachtIt was shooting up like a rocket for the first half hour, then it stopped completely. The way that post thing was compiled made it impossible to view the posts in it and no one would see my completely unrelated post in all that GME garbage because they’re all the same post and they’d stop scrolling after 6 or 7

I want to clarify, I don’t care about shitty Reddit karma, I care about exposure for charitiesIf he’s already found this page it’s a little late for himCash settled cuz you can day trade all u want just takes a day to settle your tradesRobinhood is lame and you need to have a 25K portfolio before they let you daytrade like a big boiWhy whatEuropoor here, don't think I need to pay taxes on this shitAsked the question I have been looking up and down the subreddit for! I also thank both of you.https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/options/

You can see all dates in the drop down menu.We will see bud if I’m wrong I’m wrong but I can see her adding a broad description like “enabling technology” to pump the etf up. Regardless of how it goes I’m prob gonna jump in itThans dude. Theta gang looks like a good deal, consistent money every week.Yeah that’s not a win man. I understand what you’re saying, but I’m sure you realize the unrealized loss you take on selling those calls right? Just had to comment because if you were theta gang on GME this week, yeah you made some money as theta gang does, but the potential gains you lost could be massive.3% per month!!!! Lololol! How out of touch are you!? Have you never invested your entire life before March!? I try to make 1.25% per month! Got damnI need my stimulus to help pay off my college. I'm a nontraditional going back after years of not being in college with a family to feed. I wish poor people ran our government. I'm in retail management and I've worked at stores in nice areas and stores in ghettos. Whenever we'd raise money for food banks it never failed that the rich area stores raised the least money. One common theme that I always heard from the poorer areas was, yes I'll donate, I've had to use the food bank before. I just find it amazing how quickly people forget what life was like when they were broke as fuck and in college.Fed 12 300C FB is going for 1.75

Last time FB was in this range it shot up to 302 

That 1.75 would go up 10 foldWSB does control meme stonks. Tutes control the other 90%.hmm yeah if u dive deep then perhaps u can find a great stock and not like fomo plug lol. if u do ur dd and u find that great stock i'd say make a big bet for the long term! i'm gonna hold to ICLN until June and see what ima cash out. I'm hoping it goes up 12 dollars at least by thenThat was a short squeeze.I was in at 17.GotchaEs todo pinche gringo suerte mañana viva mexico culerosAye at least you’re trying that’s enoughNo overtime pay, but you now have a manager discount which is 75% off one purchase each shift instead of 50%. That’s money back in your pocket!Okay you’re cracked my guyWhat car do you useI haven't expensed fucking anything in 10 months and the only airline/hotel status I have is shit that was extended.

KILLING MEOk, it makes more sense now. Godspeed to you are your friends.RemindMe! 2 Months “did lil Nicky lost his 100$”Yeah there’s no such thing as a Reddit ban for using the f****t word. This is definitely my only account and I’ve only been on wsb for 2 months. You are a brainless slug aren’t youoh fuck lmaoI split to X lol which promptly droppedyes but that means we don't have RH autists to pump200k yr?There is actual value up to 50ish for the current console cycle, Ryan Cohen is trying to (and succeeding at) revamping the company for the 21st century, and the shorts have artificially and recklessly driven this stock into the ground. Triple digits definitely possible during the actual squeeze.Uh the latter but both. I dropped 400 shares in at 17 and 4 grand in options, the options printed hard and I got a lot more in smaller amounts since. I have 600 shares of dkng currentlyDon’t be nervous. You got this man it’s just numbers lol not really but follow your gutGreed used to kill me. Then I learned to exit fast. I prefer to pursue 3 or 4 small winners with higher probability than try landing the big 10 bagger that will bankrupt you 9/10 times you know. Most of the time I miss out on profits, but timing the top of an option play is like, 10 times for difficult than timing the top of a stock.Really big deal. Doesnt matter if you're a smoke factory, no one wants some girl/guy finger banging themselves online looking after their kid at the stollery or school.It’s having a good time after market, I’m in for shares. I don’t fuck with options, I know the upside but I’m a pussy.Oh, just sell tomorrow then or see if DFV does his magic on Friday then sellAt the very least sell 7 and what the others rideYep. Idk what broker you use, but I’m on RH and afaik that’s the only way is to close out one and open anotherNono, there very well could be more short positions that are closed tomorrow and Friday resulting in more price movement. There was some DD I had read this morning  (I’ll edit this comment when I find it again), that mentioned that there was a substantial open interest on 1/15 $24 GME puts. There was little more than 28k in volume today on those puts against 51k open contracts


*Edit: here’s the DD I read this [morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) right before everything took off. It might not have been the one that references the 24p open interest, but still a good one to  comb through nonetheless. It’s a long post, but there are some pictures 😄😝I’m over here in the dumpsterDid u not see the price movement today hahaYea prollyI'm honestly hoping for a breather tomorrow. don't need this shit taking off so fast it stalls.Yeah I watched the volume all dayThey did this at $90 as wellI'm a wuss and am too scared to buy shorter terms in it. Or split the difference. Get half of your June ones and half 2022 ones.all we need is Joey B to mention EV's in his stimmy plan tomorrow and we're goldenYe I seen a lot of people make money off it what do they mean when they say this 1/15 ?Oh ok I seen some dude saying the gme will blowup in the next few weeks should I buy like 10 shares and hold for future ?Good pointYes, now you understandYeah I’ve noticed that2/19. I got them in December when the stock wasn't doing much. And I didn't sell when it nearly hit 100 the other day. 😑Isn’t the baseline score the pre-treatment score? Overall their experimental and control groups did not show much significance. That’s what they are stating there. And messing up something implies their inability to properly design experiments. In Short-term the price might go up but in the long run I think there’s a high risk.So in summary, 

protein expression = highly stat significant

experimental vs control = not significant

control (baseline) vs control (48-wk) = significant

Experimental (baseline) vs experimental (48-wk) = significant 

But this does not necessarily mean the treatment was significant per se. I think they might need more subjects.Lol alright man, it was definitely one CNBC talking head that cause this you’re a fucking geniusFebruary?Um never mind the stuff I just recommend is now banned. Well. Good luckFor those specific stocks you are very likely correct.You and I are talking the same language. But maybe I’m not eloquent enough. I’m trying to say exactly what you’re trying to say.He’s been on fire this weekok yeah i'd reach out to rhAlright u got it, lucid top quality version of NIO then is that better and new partnership with Amzn to bring Alexa to the car for the icing on top, so since it’s American I think 100 eoy not China manipulated and they are making their factory in Saudi$$$ ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  $$$A recall was announced AH.And?It will and that’s why you need to sell way OTM calls so they theta fuckedsigh, you too sirIt'll have to go way past 40 to be what it was worth today at 38.

I don't think me putting you on the list delists your post from the sub tho. I still see it not-collected. I can click on it and it says it's already in a collection, so obviously it renders outside of the collection.

If you find differently I'd like to know about it. This collection thing is new-ish to me. We've only used it once before.Can overnight trade with only 2k in a non cashh account. Buy at close, sell at open.  And you still have 3 day trades per week in case of a gme ripper like todayPretty sure that's the rule for all brokerages, but if you have a margin account with only 2k you can open at close and sell at open the next day. There's no day trading limits on overnight tradingEU doesn’t have cap gains tax??That's fairIt's great. Main risks are selling a stock for a lower price after it moons and buying a stock for a higher price when it tanks. Which is why the large portfolio is necessary. I won't sell a put on something I can't afford to sell another put on to average down if it tanks (ie amzn, I ain't that rich). Rkt netted me a shit ton on 200%iv in September, but it tanked hard asf. It's ended up a win in the end still by averaging down and milking small consistent profits in call sells. I wouldn't have been able to do that if I didn't have 25k to blow on averaging down. But realizing weekly and monthly profits from premium has been greatI wasn't playing gme, but that is a win. $400 on 1800 of collateral in 2 weeks? That's over a 20% return in 2 weeks, that's amazing. In any strategy there is hindsight is 20/20,i haven't cried about any position that got called away from me after it mooned.

Theta gang is about more frequent 1 to 2% days, not ten baggers.Sounds like you have a very bad strategy my friend.

Thanks for the insight, hope you make money!So they would throw it out?this actually sounds like the move.I did, but that's decently OTM for retard strengthIght well I have 1/15 calls so chill with that talk lolLmao I mean pros and cons to TLRY. Looks like they are a weed stock. All time chart isn’t pretty. Maybe a weed lagger?When is this supposed to happen for real? I've been looking trying to find some sort of announcement about it and haven't found anything. Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough

Edit: I know it's tomorrow just wondering around what time and everythingThe gamble expires on that date. So if the stock doesn't reach the price by then they lit their money on fire.Dude stock is already up like %100+ in a week... my rule is... don’t buy stock if it’s up 80% in a day....too riskyIf (when) it runs going into earnings you can flip your calls to a spread so you don’t get completely fucked by IV crush after ER.I don't think so, I think if you look at the age groups,  4-5 did better. Designing the experiment sounds easy, but we are talking about rare diseases and unknown factors and dumb luck. Here is an explanation from the CEO: [https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/events/event-details/sarepta-therapeutics-39th-annual-jpmorgan-healthcare-conference-presentation](https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/events/event-details/sarepta-therapeutics-39th-annual-jpmorgan-healthcare-conference-presentation). Right at the beginning.  I could be wrong about this, but who knows. Scroll to 7 minutes, he explains.No I don't think it's that way, but agree they need more subjects. See the other post or scroll to 7 minutes in this presentation: [https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/events/event-details/sarepta-therapeutics-39th-annual-jpmorgan-healthcare-conference-presentation](https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/events/event-details/sarepta-therapeutics-39th-annual-jpmorgan-healthcare-conference-presentation)

in 4-5 year olds, treatment was statistically significant.  

in 6-7 year olds, it was not due to difficulty establishing baseline.   Curious your thoughts, maybe the CEO is full of bullshit?And the risk is when there is nothing fueling the fomo then people aren't buying as many options the stock will bleed and could crash, huh just gotta wait until there are no more catalysts left and then start to shortHe said he had a 65 to 70PT for DKNG, but didn't give us a TL for it.Idk man tough call. Personally I would say Canoo $GOEV gets to 100 before lucid does. That’s just my thoughts though.I have retrieved these for you _ _

Fuck tho I’m tryna get my money up and not my funny up; cause this one call of Tesla is mad expensive since I’m doing cash covered putsHow far out r u selling CCs?But maybe he’s just posturing in that comment 🤔Regardless, it’s not from anything related to GME and I feel like what you did is hurting exposure for charities so please take it outYeah but youre not understamding. I am on a cash settled account. So i can make as many trades per day as i want. The trade is settled by the next day. I like this type of account. But i judt went over 25k today so i might look into a margin account now. But TDA rates are junkYeah but once a year over the total amount of cash you hold in savings+investment accounts. So if I sell and then buy and repeat that 10 times, it has no tax consequencesPoint taken, can’t argue about profits. When you’re doing you’re theta gang, how many plays are you doing at a time on average? Thanks for the continued conversation btwWell my very bad strategy has afforded me financial freedom over many years. Cheers.LolImma look into it my g, right now I’m balls deep in GME but I’m gonna need somewhere to put the gains so thanks 🇲🇽📈I bought a TW octane for 80 bucks 2 weeks ago and now it’s worth 130....I'm debating dropping everything to focus on getting Premier 1K back this year. Once I'm vaccinated I'll be traveling a shit ton for personal downtime. No idea yet when the hell work will green light biz travel again..Cool bro have fun being a 12 year old girlWouldn't touch FDs. Planning on buying more shares and 1/22 calls tomorrow morning. If it triples from current price then I could care less about IV.Same to you! Good luck 🍀yeah, when you feel like your up good and are complacent, that's the time to exit, simple. Otherwise, MMs will eat you alive bro, they know retards are greedy. Good luck broIf you disclosed on the resume that you had an OF then ya lolYup it's a good one. Lock in your profits but still got some going so you don't fomoRetard strength is gone broLmao hey man, refuel tomorrow for the Pluto rocket to $420 on Friday.Merging with APHA...should do well in the weed space.715pmSomeone said like 7:30p est or some shit like that so its way after market closeOh ok so my understanding is u call for a price and date that a specific stock will go too then u get paid basaiclly ?That's the hope. I should have done that yesterday. I hope your target is right though!So I don’t know much about this disease specifically but in developmental or neural developmental studies it is normal to account for the age when you use treatments. The impression I had from their initila approach is they failed to properly design their experiments because they did not account for the age which is typically a norm in the field. Yes 4-5 years old does improve functional scores overall compare to 6-7. Results seem fine as long as their analyses are all accurately done (which can only be found when they publish their results on peer reviewed papers). Some concerns I have are that they primarily measured functional scores but no others, potential side effects in the long term. Also if this is age dependent, let’s say it works only at early age before 5, it significantly reduces the market size for the product.. I think this may be the biggest problem with their results. But yea it looks like it is working okayish for early groups (although no long term clinical scores are collected) as long as the CEO is not bullshitting some parts in their slides. And just a reminder that only peer reviewed papers are trustworthy in general..Godspeed 🌈🐻 GodspeedHard to put an exact timeline on these things.  You in shares or calls?Based on a rumor of apple that’s not confirmed?Lucid actually has cars on the street you know right?Not long. Just 2 weeks out. Yeah they are pricey, Tesla is a volatile stock.He’s got even more calls for April. I don’t think he’s selling anything anytime soon.I'm saying regardless of everything, and especially with you probably dropping below 25k in the future, you should open up a separate robinhood margin account.  Only need 2k to fund it and then can open trades at close and close at open next dayEU becoming more appealing by the dayAt least 10,most expire worthless I can average down where I need toI made 13k om gme today and sold so i can reposition with shorter dated calls. Shit is flying. Those other plays are the 'diversification'   but fr sos is gomma be big and eng also. Calls are cheap few mpmths away. GME 🚀🚀🚀🌋🌋🌋🚀🚀🚀  What stike u playing dudeI think I lost my Hilton diamond status.  I've been too afraid to call and ask lmao[deleted]Thanks!Wouldn’t the employer do a scan and find you have an only fans.forreal. maybe ill do my part and buy shares with the profits tooJust what I wanted to hear. Thank you. How low we dipping??Fuck well hopefully there's anticipation buys beforehand and hope that we ride a rocket on FridayMe too. I’m like 70% that it hits 105 after ER. Overall market conditions are the big risk here.Yes, and he spoke to the point, not accounting for proper baselines in the 6-7 group.  And yes they need to publish the results of the work to a peer reviewed paper, agreed.   I think the stock is oversold, but you make great points.  This treatment is noted for its lack of side effects (Pfizer's version has lots of side effects).  I'm excited for the peer reviewed paper as well, and that's what matters. But this is a very prestigious company that is already selling products to help in this space. Good points, thanks.2500 shares at 54. Sold my 40k calls and just went all shares.Based on that they are a tech/car manufacturer. I see a lot of commercial use potential. Lucid is like the Ford of ev imo. Yes the cars are very luxurious and beautiful. But nothing more then just cars. Most people won’t need cars if robotaxis take over.Yea how many of them do you see every day?Why does the break even have to be higher than my strike price / target price?Oh yeah i should. I have a rh account that is down 100% 20k right now. I will greatly enjoy bringing that back to lifeLower salaries but no domestic terrorism. It kinda evens outI sold at nearly the top today and got in in the dip again in 39c 1/15 lmfao let’s hope the squeeze keeps on going tomorrowIf you had it going into 2020, it should still be good.

Worst case, you can just get the Hilton Aspire CC - comes with Diamond status.You really that upset about me saying market cap for the value of assets in an ETF? Go outside bro find a hobby or some shitDid you use your real name???Beats me. 12ish...and that is based on nothing but a guess. I sold half of my 2022 at 150% gain and will let the other half ride.Yea but becareful with the stock since there is likely an investigation by a law firm (Portnoy Law Firm from the news). SP might not move too much in short term. I would hold shares over calls since such investigation can hinder SP recovery. They also have other pipelines so it might be worth a shot.  good luck!Shit you’re good, well hit 60 soon.Yes but people buy stocks who are selling products, there’s a reason NNDM is at 11, they aren’t selling their products but it’s a brilliant idea. When GoEv has a factory and a loyal customer and is pumping out numbers then yeah, before then no, it’s gonna stay low until they have those. Even if it gets momentum they’re gonna do an offering every pop because they have no moneySame amount as NIOKINGI got absolutely zero work done today at my job...  

I spent all day watching GameStop’s price action and waiting on the gain porn that /u/DeepFuckingValue was gonna drop on us at the end of the day.

You’ve done it again.  Your massive dick has somehow grown even larger.  You sir are a true WSB legend and will end up being #1 on the Hall of Fame.

Edit: And he’s still holding his contracts expiring this Friday!! Balls of steel and he’s that confident in GME continuing to 🚀🚀🚀.  I’ll continue to hold with you!YOU STILL DIDNT SELL THE 1/15s!!!!?????

His Diamond Hands flow through us.I was refreshing frantically during power hour for your update!  
  
I mean, you bought the Jan 15 calls months ago. Got ridiculed, derided and shat on.  
  
But to time it that perfectly, to be ITM just a couple of days before expiry, the odds of that happening are slim.  
  
Most of us retards can't predict the price action for tomorrow, you could see it from half a year away! Well fuckin done, damn!  
  
"You held!" and "You are still in!" must be the most common replies you might have got in the last 3 months. Balls of MT steel, sir!For me that would be fat fire. I‘d rip my pants off in our daily teams call tomorrow and never look back. Please fuck you.

Edit: KING 👑To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Melvin Capital. The analysis is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the price targets will go over a typical bull's head. There's also Nagel's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The Glizzies understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these shorts, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about $GME . People who long GME ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate the math in Curt's existential catchphrase "$1.60 PT," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Melvin's genius wit unfolds itself on their stock screeners. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

JK, you are a god amongst mortals... you’re going to exercise the 1/15 $20 aren’t you? You’re going to single handedly wipe Melvin off this plane of existence aren’t you?OMG you still had the 1/15sPetition to make this guy a mod 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀## You know this shits going on Wall Street Journal or some shit tomorrow right?🚀 I FUCKING LOVE YOU 🚀 I AINT FUCKING SELLING 🚀2.6 mil in a day, fuck my wife I begWill you fuck my wife please?Who is u/DeepFuckingValue? 🙄🤭🤔🤫😰

So this guy has mad a fuck tonne on GameStop stock increasing from 0.40 to its current value at 31.40.

Are the calls on the left his safety nets? 
If so why hasn't he increased them to something more inline with its current value?

You bought these calls literally a year ago, and you couldn't have chosen a better date than Jan 15 2021 WTFSon I am back from the cigarette store!!You held on to that 20c that expires in two days 1/15, any reason you didn't sell after the [trend broke this morning after the huge run-up](https://i.imgur.com/d3h3C0j.png)?

GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀= WHALE-MAKER 🐳🐳🐳🐳How does your back feel carrying around that huge cock?What can I say... I remember reading ur bet a while back and feeling conflicted. Ended up w a tiny position and still can’t believe the last daysI assume he’s going to exercise those 1/15, then he’ll have 150K shares, he deserves a board seatDFV - WSB leader that has become legend.  Loading more shares tomorrow.  He has united all Middle Earth retard kingdoms.alright I'm done. Im just gonna start yoloing on whatever everyone else in this sub yolos on. What's next.I recognize that portfolio style...  
  
You should call your broker and ask them if you should yeet this shit. They won't give advice, but they'll have a field day talking about you with their team.turned $70 into $1.1M on one tradeMan looking at your post history and replys to the hate is gold, balls of steel.  Congrats on the play.Commenting to be part of 🚀🚀🚀history🚀🚀🚀

And Because i bought 40 shares yesterday Thanks to this DFV genius among autistsLooking back at the original post a year ago the comments are hilarious. Something about landing a jetliner in between the bid ask spread and how OP wouldn’t be able to close the positions.DFV hands!!!!!!!!!!! legendary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Is it too late to get in on this gme action with calls?53k to 6MYou are my idol. If DFV is still in, I'm still in.Congratulations and fuck you.Fucking congrats man. YOLO inspirationCan I get a small loan of 1 million?Is this like real money ? I never even saw 5k in real life 😂😭Daddyyeahhh if you could just give me the next GME that'll be super..

congratulations too btw, i would have never expected gamestop to bounce back this wellJust wanted to say I was here for this. What a legendCan someone clarify me something about options? So he has those calls, if he does exercise the call he can buy 100 shares per contract for the option price, right? So when he exercise that he won't sell the calls since he is the owner, so he won't get those millions? I thought you gained money in options by selling your contracts, if he keeps them he can buy at 20$ and sell at 30$? I know I'm wrong just don't really understand whereThis is the last fuckin time I dont follow u damn autists on a meme stock! Nice gains fam 🤣🤘helllooooooo capital gains!IMO many of us will never earn 1% of this play in many years2.7m in one day.

Edit: 🚀🚀🚀The massive fucking balls on DFV... Wow. I hate this stupid company and ultimately think they will fail, but it doesn't matter because you'll still be set for life. I'm kicking myself for not buying in when they were $3 a share because it would've been a great hedge to my hope that they'd finally go bankrupt. Every experience I've had with this store has been terrible and I have no clue how they're still around. I guess their brand is really that valuable?Bought in today for the first time.....this is the wayYou won.Not gonna lie, I woke up thinking about those 1/15s this morning. $1M single day gain 2 days before expiration. Yo.What if DFV was actually Ryan Cohen?LMFAO my boomer dad really worked his whole life for that and this guy made it in 1 year. When’s fucking legendThis guy fucksCan someone explain to me how the fuck this happened? If we can just balloon a stock like that, why not just do it every week and make a shit ton off options and shit. I know next to nothing about the market except “sell for higher than you bought”.40k would change my life but this mf yolo'ing hundreds of thousands lmao holy shitHey, you dropped this 👑The Supreme ruler.Bro you made me a ridiculous amount of money and I thank you for sharing with us. I was a sold back in October, and GME delivered hard today.Ya but like, who even really NEEDS money, anywaysAt this point, just pull out, invest in a low risk 8% gain and live off the 400,000 a year in capital gainsWSB LEGEND. My kids will remember your name.Why didn’t I follow him Monday?I dont understand anything on screen but those are some big numbers

Good work47k into options and you fucking did it. One of them expires in 2 days and it mooned.

I guess I could’ve been a millionaire if I put 47k down in options. Were they ITM when you bought?1 year ago started a great journey. Look at all the doubters all the way back then

Check out [his comments here](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpwjy8/gme_yolo_monthend_update_oct_2019/f60dsd8/), when he had just $100k in his account. Absolutely baller. 

Also clicked through to Zer033x’s profile, the person who's telling him he's an idiot. Zero's last comment is from 9 months ago, when he said: “I only do short plays lately.” He has not had any activity on Reddit since then, and, well…we all know how short plays probably did from April/May to now.

So, uh... RIP Zer033xomg omg the King wins so hard I wish my name was ValueFUCK YOUI just had the single best trading day ever thanks to your plays and 💎🙌 encouraging me to hold and add on dips. 

Congrats, and thank you for the DD and steadfast patience!All hail the king. 2 days before expirationAs I saw my meager shares rocket today i thought of you and wish I had the balls.You deserve more! Think about all of the retards that followed you into this.

Also: in case that the call reaches the date limit, he has to put money to buy the stocks? (what happens if he doesnt have the money?)Quit giving him Reddit awards. King Retard already has enough treasuresAbsolute mental. CongratsCongratulations my dude!Hi from frontpage.

I don't really understand what has happened here, can someone please let me know where I've gone wrong?

* First row: op bought 50k shares at 14.89 each, today's price is $31.40, so OP has made $825k profit (worth)
* Second row: OP, at some point in the past, bought 1000 shares at 0.0726 each (???).
* These shares, he will sell at $20/share, regardless, on Jan 15 2021 (???)
* Today, the shares are worth $31.40 each? But what does 11.40 last price indicate for the second row? Where does the million dollars come from (??)
* Third row: (???)

Hey, you (almost) doubled your money. Nobody ever went broke doing that.

Burry is going to pull a wet fart out of his hat. I appreciate the fact that he's trying to be an activist investor by goading the GME board into buying back stock, but I don't think that's going to work for this rodeo.

Well, at this point, you could sell half your options and break even, leaving the other half to experience whatever sorts of gains you imagine they might. It's like these options have paid you to play the lottery.

Jesus Christ, you people *are* degenerates.I need some help boys. I got some calls I wanna sell for... $24.5 GME 2/5. I tried selling today on RH and they didn't filled. What's the problem? Volume, Open Interest... I don't understand this stuff.So should I buy GME? HahaFucking rich guyWant to pay off my student loans? You beautiful retard.It makes no logical sense that Gamestop... A failing and largely reviled by gamers, brick and mortar game store is suddenly making all these moves. Congrats to people getting rich off this but I tend not to buy into shit that makes no sense to me.I’m so retarded, I don’t even know if this post means something good or something badYo WTF happened today? I don't understand anything anymore.What’s the benefit in having the April ‘21 $12 call?So help me out what was his initial outlay?How did you select GME for this YOLO? Maybe you could share some knowledge so other retards can be as blessed.so





let's say I have 2k to yolo in the morning. 

what strikes should I buy?[deleted]Everyone keeps talking about another leg, is it gonna happen?  I FOMOed into a call pretty late in the day, but I'm worried I'm just gonna get iv crushed in the morning...Massive applause but... can you unload all those calls before eod Friday? I mean.. you have half the cash to execute those calls.. I’ll lend you the other half for half the price of your margin :)Can I have 2000 dollarsI understand calls a bit but can anyone explain the call scenario here and why the gains were so huge ?what does $20 call mean? also, how did you pay .0726? I do not see that anywhere in the history.Okay so I'm just a regular autist. I'm not a full blown weaponized autistic like the rest of you. Can anyone explain to me how these calls work?Is the short squeeze over? How will we know when it’s close to over. Pls help.Does OP make more money if he just let the Jan 15 option expire?

He's deep ITM anyways if it expires tomorrow. There's no way GME drops below $20.Got here from r/all...someone please tell me what the heck I'm looking at so I can appreciate it more.coming from r/all, can anone explain this in layman terms?ok i wandered in from /all, can someone tell me wtf happened here? seems like he paid a tiny amount for gamestop stocks that then skyrocketed for some reason? 

why did he think gamestop would rise? what is up with january 15? idk shit about investing and am very new to it so genuinely interested in what this guy didSeen this on Reddit Popular post feed... Im intrigued but some please explain what does this all mean!?!?Hi, I'm from r/all

Where did this money come from? Did someone or a company lose it to him like a bet?[deleted]What the hell is happeningThis subreddit is unkempt. Jesus fuck.Praise him 🙏🏻🙏🏻 he is our messiah 🙌🏻🙌🏻 GME 🚀🚀🚀 we shall follow him till we are all rich or die trying 🤚🏻💎🤚🏻💎I'm kinda a huge retard on this guys, please don't kill me, but am I reading this correctly?  His majesty paid .07 cents a share for the option, so he paid $7,000 a long time ago, and he's got until Friday to sell his position or exercise his option, but if he had done that at the time this screenshot was taken, he'd have essentially turned $7000 into over 1.1 million USD?!!!!What made you spend 800k on GameStop to begin with? Genuinely curious what you saw that you were so confident in cAuse you nailed itFor all you guys who made a killing today, I am on the board of a non profit and we have been supplying food and PPE for elderly and poor NYC residents.     If you want to make a donation and pay it forward, message me and I can provide you details!Imagine GME going 35% down tomorrow.I ... I just can't. Gamestop is a store, that's it. I really hope you have a 7 figure net worth bro.The fact that he went long on GME and only gained 110% return on his position, is really dragging down his overall performance.What the fuck is wrong with youIf you didn’t sell you’re an idiotCan someone explain to me what I’m seeing hereWait guys how do we know this isn’t inspect element?As someone who wants to start gambling like a professional, where the fuck do I learn how to do this?

I don't even know how to read this graph, other than to recognize Numbers Green, Numbers Big.Awwww those poor expiring calls. Why don’t you just be a big boy and move em over to next week.Who the fuck has 6M laying around to YOLO?I dont get it, how could anyone know that GME that has done jack shit since 2010 but tank would pop up in one day gains it hasnt seen in a decade. I DONT UNDERSTAND. now some tool is gonna come in here and say "It wAs ObViOUs..." but they put no gains.Noob here. Is this a good stock to jump into? Figured I'd invest my stimulus in something, see if I can make enough for a small peice of land.So how did he make money? Im not sure what I am looking at...So he yolo 800k? What % of portfolio was that?
Must have had inside info of board shakeup?So why did it go up 50% today, it’s fucking game stop lolWait... This was valued at $3m a few weeks ago? GME goes up 70% and you make only 800k more?This may be the dumbest question here. But can someone explain how the hell he made such profit on his two calls? I get the buy and hold on his $14 purchase. But I'm a bit dumfounded on how the profit came from the other two positions of Jan and April?I'm kinda new to options. What is the benefit to holding the contracts after they've hit the strike price?So to be sure, did OP really makr $5.7 Million in a single day from the most risky bet in Wall Street[deleted]Seriously, how the fuck is GME worth anything?I'm new to this sub and don't get what I'm seeing here, I can see he made 2.7m profit but how should I interpret the rest?Confused as to what’s going on? Just found this on my explore, can someone please explain?:DHello I am from all, what is this?Are you smoking fucking crack? You dropped $800,000 into one play? What percentage of your net worth was that at the time.... Obviously you cost averaged into the position but how much of your networth were you willing to risk? You definitely know what the fuck your doing Jesse Livermore. 

   Wait no nvm... Does this guy only yolo fucking GameStop🤨... What the fuck is this? How? This defies logic, it doesn’t make sense.... Of all 6,000 publicly traded companies between the NYSE and NASDAQ, fucking GameStop.... Your posts are baffling... WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? FUCKING GAMESTOP FUCKING GAMESTOP... WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCKING SHIT IS THIS... FUCKING GAMESTOP... $5,700,000 ON FUCKING GAMESTOP TELL ME YOU DIDN’T RISK ALL YOUR LIQUID NET WORTH AND BECOME A MULTIMILLIONAIRE OFF FUCKING GAME STOP... WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT...

   You couldn’t have possibly risked your whole liquid net worth, not even 20%, not even 2-5% on fucking GameStop.... You work for or have worked for a hedge fund or in PE.... No one could have seen that... There’s no way in hell a retail trader could have this level of risk tolerance.... Without possessing a high level of understanding in financial markets and a strong financial backing.... With high liquidity... Unless you’re the ultimate autist.... 

   If so how the actual fuck do you have this level of risk tolerance? Survivorship bias is why you’re a god in this sub.... Your success realistically propagates and stimulates at least a mild sense of delusional grandeur for financial success, & of course a hyper stimulation for gamblers fallacy among 1.7million people.... You do understand this..... This is why you’re a deity in WSB.... Gamblers fallacy can be very powerful....  Ego validation is why you’ve demonstrated your wins feels fucking good... I’m fully aware that you know the level of delusion and fallacy in this sub the majority of all their brokerage accounts cannot do not make money consistently.... That’s why you experience so much praise... Tell me not...?Please explain why are u still holding and not at least cashing ur position expiring this weeklol that's great and all but this price action still makes no since. omg e-commerce tripled... from like shit to shitx3 still shit. This company is shit."Bragging about having money is a sign of poor breeding."So everyone is just sucking this guy’s dick?I understand absolutely nothing about whats posted in this sub why is everyone considered a retardMeh it's a lot less than I thoughtStep 1: be richDamn, if you hadn’t put so much into your long position you would have killed it even more.Congrats already rich to begin withMr. FBI is watching yo assInside trader.[deleted]I didn't find any posts that meet the matching requirements for r/wallstreetbets.

Now, I know how TSLA people feel on days it's rocketing.I have 600 shares and all I did was stare at GME stock.I almost crashed my carSame thing here. I was fairly productive in the first half of the day but when i randomly checked my portfolio and saw the 80 % gamestop gain i couldnt go back to work i had to look up more DD posts and find out if any shorts had covered.same lol I was just cryingYep saw it skyrocket this morning and didn’t even go to work.I don't even have any skin in the game but I couldn't stop watching GME and WSB for most of todayI have done fuck all of studying today. Been eyeing the GME chart ALLLLLLLL DAAYYYYSame. Today was awesome.you and everybody else on that first line of your comment lmaoooThis fact (he's holding) makes me want to open my first ever call position but I have no clue what I'm doing lolDays like this are comparable to me to going to the casino with your buds and playing craps together. Most of the time, we either all make money or all of us lose some money. 

Either way, win or lose, doing together is a hell of a time and feels like money well spent.He's been holding for year plus...whats a few more days? Exercise the contracts....continue to hold the shares....when it hits $100 you have $10mm just on those alone, not including his other positions. Jesus fucking christ....Name checks outI’m not a fan of working anyway. Glad I could spend the day watching DFV making himself a legendam a teacher. was really hard to teach today lolHe's been holding those contracts for a year now. He got so lucky with the Jan 15th dateBro same lol I nearly faked sick. Going up that much in one morning just makes my reality relatable lolCan someone link me to some context? Why did he buy GameStop a year ago?I’m in Asia and I made this mistake of peaking a look at my phone after it started to rocket and now I’m tired as fuck cause is stayed up all night looking at it.  

I asked my girl if I should sell and she at 75.. if
I’m a pussy. Otherwise let it ride !Why is it skyrocketing?Shit man I hope you don't work at gamestop!!!It’s like no-face in spirited away that eats everything.

We ain’t selling!DFV Hands is when the diamond hands are so diamond that calling them diamond no longer equates to the diamondness of the hands.I hope that becomes a phraseRoll those fuckers in to more. Singlehandedly drive the market with the MMs having to hedge against the new contracts, lol.Convincing myself that THOSE 1000 MOTHERFUCKING CALLS expiring in 2 days and many other autists here who followed OP over period of last 6-8 months started this marvelous launch to moon today.I cashed out my 1/15's this morning at 10:15, at the very beginning of the run. I got out at a profit, but if I had held it literally would have been 10x the profit.

I keep telling myself - "at least they didn't expire worthless!"

F'ing paper hands... at least I still have shares & Apr calls so it was still a good day for me! Just coulda been better!He probably just forgot. Nobody is this ballsy.. right?They’re so deep ITM that theta doesn’t even matter now. Unless there’s a drop before Friday might as well hold before expiration. Those can still run.Probably planning to exercise since their ITM. He is the definition of long investor not traderNoob question: what happens to them on the 15th when they expire? Do they get automatically exercised?Let's get this man on the board of directorsHe must have fucking known ever sinceI will use that term from now onLooks like screenshot was taken around 10:15am EST. Maybe he sold at the peak?I’m actually sad to see this.  I sold my 1/15s today because I didn’t know what to do.  Held my shares though.I hope he exercises them.Or Yolo SwagginsYeah Holy Shit.  I sold my 1/15s mid day when it hit $29.  I still have lots of shares and April $35 calls, but those 1/15s had to go, fam.  Not paper hands, but def not diamond.  Maybe iron?DFV hands cut diamonds like hot butter, that's how fucking next level they areHe’ll probably exercise them Wurtzite Boron Nitride hands welded onto this bit. Fuck your shit. Get on this free money train.He had to have forgotten he had these options lmaoNot for nothin, 1/15 55p for OSTK popped today too.What does that sentence mean?

They’re literally retarded, and if you know or are confident that something is going to moon, you don’t need to worry about dips here and there. One of these people sold 80k of Apple after a dip like 10-20 or more years ago (idk when it was trading). He would’ve been a multi millionaire by now if he held I think.

Obviously i know nothing and thus i will stay in until DFV exits.

Gotta thank the guy for the tendies, entered late with shares (around 14), but still 10% gain of my whole portfolio in just one day is madness.People need to stop talking about retirement around here,  we do what we do for the love of the sport, there is no retiring, we keep going til the wheels fall offYou wear pants to a teams call?...Lmao dude I feel that so much... I had a 1/8 23c which expired worthless :( i missed getting out of the rat race by a week :((((Seriously. $5M is enough. Just cash out OP... you're good to retire.IMO, it's definitely the time to cash out all of that. Maybe keep a little bit still on the line (like 20% at most), just in case it goes up more, so that you don't have FOMO or too many regrets if it somehow goes up again. There's something far worse than missing out on a bigger profit: having a big profit in your hands, and letting it fall through.

Take the money and run. But keep the dayjob (or job hunt for a more enjoyable dayjob), at least for a year or two. If you quit your dayjob, you'll find that you spend the money all day long, and it goes away very quickly. The dayjob helps prevent impulse purchases.I would just pump that shit into some high yield dividend ETFs and call it a day for life. Capital will appreciate further and divvies will take care of fat fire.🤣 🚀 🚀 🚀😂😂😂Let’s gooooooo!Seems like they just week awaiting all these contracts, they are really starting to add up!2.7*2.6 millimeters?You jack to this trade yet?The Diamond Handed GodSame brother.

🍆Fucking

🍆ValueMetallic hydrogen hands!Sure.  Stonks only go up.He started with an initial 50k investment last year and now he's up to almost 5.8 million

He is our godMe too. Fun ride.I’ve wondered that about this dude too.  I’d worry about getting hit by a banana truck and ending up in a coma while they expire or some shit.  I hope he’s had a talk with his wife about how to get into his account and sell them.  Of course she’s probably super smart and nice with a giant set of milkers.Dude is diamond hands for sure but to be fair they were "only" worth 100k yesterday, the calls were ATM so it didn't look too bad anyway. He has already made millions from his originial 100k investment, 1.1M in realized cash. $100k is play money for this guyI'm interested tooYeah but they were $7 per contract when he bought them. Whats $7000 of contracts worth when you are already up $3million on the play lolThere’s no hedge here, this is just a full bull play. Look up call options.

As for the meteoric rise in value, look for any of the GME threads in this sub or VW in 2008.Those are lotto tickets made out of his diamond testiclesThe calls on the left are where all the money came from. You can see what he paid for them and what they are worth.Some hedge funds assumed GameStop (GME) would go bankrupt, or at least remain valued in the single digits.
GME did not, in fact, go bankrupt. They even got a very prominent activist investor’s interest, and he is positioning to takeover the company.
OP saw that a lot of people had overextended themselves in assuming GME bankruptcy, and GME could spike in value if anything pushed the price up. This is because they have to cover their positions (short sells and puts,) and the amount of shares available is finite & depleted (because of their reckless abandon in shorting.) 

OP put his thesis to the ultimate test and threw his money at GME call options (at the dates and costs listed above.) 

He was correct. 

TL;DR: people expected bankruptcy, bet on it, lost the bet, and now they have to pay up by buying shares. This causes share value to skyrocket. 

Just google “GME short squeeze Reddit”

Edit: former 3rd key at GameStop, a long time ago. Solidarity.Buy GME get rich 🚀🚀🚀This is the way.Lmao, wheels.You might not belong here. 😉It's unbelievable!time traveler. or sometimes the starts just align right to form a massive bull cock and balls.GodamnitLiterally 9 days after BL droppedDer SenseiMinimum $250k per dollar move, I’d say at least $7.5mil at today’s highThe timing is uncannyI almost doubt the retards running GameStop would have even predicted this.  Their boomer CEO was probably planning to pilot the company straight while pillaging everything that isn’t bolted down like the guy from Sears did a few years ago.📈it’s the best game in the worldwould take two seconds of reading the sub to figure it out dingusIf I’m reading it correctly it was $7000->$1.1M.

$7 per contract. 1000 contracts were bought.  Still ridiculous nonetheless.Yes, just buy the stock. Almost too lateIn a gd yr. fuck. On gme. WowGME is the next GME. This is just the beginning. 100 share easyInterested to know this alsoHe will buy the shares for cheap (the strike price) and sell them on the market for the current much higher price immediately thereafter.  I'm not exactly sure the logistics of this, but that's the gist of it.  The option price is subtracted from his profits so at the end of all transactions he'll have paid the strike price + the option price for each share then sold them at current market value.  Option price is also know as premium.  You pay a premium for the right to buy shares at the strike price and if the price goes down you will lose 100% of that premium unless you sell the options but they'll lose value quickly if the trade goes the other way.If he executes the calls he will get 100 shares *per contract* at the strike price (he has $12 and $20 strikes, 1000 contracts of each). He can then do whatever he wants with those shares. The contracts combined are 200,000 shares at an average cost of $16 per share.

He would need $3.2 million cash to execute all those contracts. If he does not have the cash the contracts will be automatically sold on their expiration date, likely to a large institution who will profit virtually risk free on the tiny spread between the option price and the stock price. That also means he loses that little sliver of profit by not executing the contracts himself.He's coming up on a almost a year holding a lot of that GME.He started with almost $800k, most of us will never have even a quarter of that in liquid assets.Of course they're gonna fail, it's a brick and mortar multimedia company in a world where you can get fresh tomatoes delivered to your doorstep without getting off the toilet.

But for investors, especially options people; what a fucking opportunity!!

And I fucking played goev and ktos.  RIP my portfolio.Seriously?!  The FIRST day you bought into the gme hype was THE day?  That's bonkers, but congrats.It’s the beginning stages of a short squeeze. Look at VW in 2008.Outta here with this boomer shit. MARS NEXT 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀What is low risk and 8%?  AT&T type play?I knew I should haveYou could've been a millionaire if you put $2500 into 1/15 35C. They were as low as $2 an option today and at peak, they went for $800 a pop.Cramer should call him.Like a 🌈🐻Yes it will. Despite all the hype today wasn’t even **THE** squeeze. It certainly was SOME short positions covering, but most likely some insider buying mixed with those covers and then the day traders swinging options and yeah, you saw what happened.


This will definitely climb more. Buy shares. Apr calls.You think he held all this time for this? Watch and learn.Agree, this guy and some other dude a couple of months ago that also DD'd GME going up during a new console cycle (well before the wsb hype) deserve their gains 100%it's probably a mod.His 1st post via his usernamei shall contributedo not question the KING!This is the only yolo. Never sellTHIS is the yolo, bro. The yolo ain't overHe made around 5 million on gamestop. He is the messiahHis very first post shows a cost basis of approx. $53,700, I think he didn’t add anything else in.FProbably one eye burry.... Or he is one eye 🤷‍♂️Thanks for the flash back.  DFV is so confident, and correct!2019. The mad man has been waiting for this all this timeHe never comments, it’s part of his coolnessHe made 2.7milNo you math wrong, $7,260 is now a mil.dude it is 7206$He has had multiple calls for 1/15. The $20s have always been 0.0726.ppl been saying that to him since christmasOr is this Michael Burry's alt account and wsb was a critical piece to the overall strategy? Inspiring this sub to diamond hand GME, knowing years ago that he'd eventually need all of us to united to take down the professional 🌈🐻s in order to get his position over the finish line. From the outset he never talked shit to those who doubted, took us through the ups and downs while never wavering in conviction like only someone with neutron stars for balls can do, then we finally knew who to follow with similar conviction to fuck the shorts and never sell. A calculated move to embolden the shorts to make the mistake of thinking 1.8m internet strangers couldn't act as one and change the course of stock market history and finally let him finish his trade while giving us tendies along the way. Yes, u/DeepFuckingValue is Michael Burry, but is this really just about a trade to make money? Yes it is, but also about showing the power of a group of autists with stimulus checks and diamond hands, and maybe also friendship or why Jim Cramer can never wield such power.

To have diamond hands is to inspire diamond hands50k into 5 million. he’s been in gme for over a yearHe turned about 50k into about 5.5 millionWhy?We going up!Because he's diamond handed it for >1 yr to get hereBasically 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀100k ishHe made $2.7M in one dayHe bought into GME last year when everyone thought it was going bankrupt.Other way. He’s got the right to buy 100 shares per contract at the strike price.Run, and never return. It’s for your own good. 

“Get out of here, Dewey. You don't want no part of this shit.”2.7m for the dayHe paid a lot less than thatOg bet a year ago was 53k ishStarted with 50k over a year ago I believe based off his post historyA fucking legend at work. Just spinning goldThe kind is making BANK off GameStop stockThis man believed in GameStop when no one else didGo away, GDI.ITM. They're his *if* he wants to buy at the strikeHe’ll probably exercise them meaning but them at the call price. He could sell them at face value too but only if you do absolutely nothing will they expire worthless. And on RH they would automatically sell them idk about other brokerages cause I’m poor.?He wouldn't owe anything but he is currently risking $700,000 of capital and $4.3M of paper gains, could lose everything if stock sinks to 0 but it won't happen.In standard call/put option buying (not selling, buying,) loss is capped at the premium of the option. Basically, you can only lose what you paid for the option. 

However, that is only the case when buying a call or a put. Selling can lead to owing money, which is exactly what is happening to the funds that bet against GME.🚀🚀🚀🚀Easy. Download Robinhood. Transfer all money into account. Buy GME shares. 🚀🚀🚀🚀Derivatives. Look into options if you want to learn more.Almost a year ago.How can you tell when he sold?  Did you just do the math?Look at his profile retardhe wasn’t buying shares, he was buying options contracts - This allowed him to have a more leveraged position and thus why he had much higher percent gainsUhh, cause options...?He bought 1000 contracts.40k initial investment, moved options gains to purchase the underlying security in this case GME.Stonks go up.This is the memo. Train hasn't left the station yet don't get left behind.DFV is a good looking young man. Only common with Cramer: man (without wanting to assume for either of them). 
   
He’s Roaring Kitty on YouTube, check him out.Thats the option price retardHe started with about 80k in GME options a year ago and now has over 5 million dollarsHe's just a normal guy. Streaming right now on YouTube. Roaring kitty.2.7 in one dayI have 100 shares at $10 each. You think the price will go over $20 by April. I don't think it will go that high, so I sell you a bet (a covered call) that pays me $100 per contract (100 shares) and in exchange agree to sell you the shares at $20, even if the price goes higher than that. If it doesn't get to $20 I keep my shares and profit the $100 premium.You have to go way back to the early posts , but he started with 40-50k and ended up with 5.7 millionThe first row is just shares, $14.89 is the average price he paid per share, of which he has 50,000That’s not 1000 shares, that’s 2000 contracts and each contract is worth 100 shares.Go back to options 101. 

But yes if he decides to exercise his calls ( which he’s prolly going to) he will have to put up a certain amount. Then he’ll own those thousands of shares at a HUGE discount.OP actually bought calls on the second and third row.You’ll have to look up call options on YouTube for the second and third row. 

He started with less shares much cheaper at the start, but kept adding shares as he exercised call options along the wayHe made bets a long time ago that the stock would be where it is today. like when it was around 5 dollars a share he bet over a year into the future it would be 20 dollars. The further out you bet the cheaper the per stock price is. Bet long time ago + very right about it = rich dude.You think people are apart of this sub to live frugally ?Hes had the calls for monthsNo that one cost 7usd per contract and he has 1000 of them so 100×1000=100000 shares“I AINT FUCKING SELLING!”

DFV, Probably.The rich get richer my friendYou doubt GME will go above 35. You must be stupid. It’ll be 40 end of month easilyGoogle is hardHoly shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.

Probably just a coincidence.Read his 1st post. Read the comments and the date. You’ll understand.A year and a half ago, he bet that GameStop’s stock price would rise almost tenfold by now. It’s done even better. Many consider the company the next Blockbuster, but his research shows otherwise. The tens of thousands of dollars he invested is now worth millions. He’s my daddy and has balls of steel!!He bought calls, which are options, on gamestop. You buy calls when you think the stock will go up. They can increase wayy more and way faster than just buying shares.

Simply put gamestop rocketed and his calls increased in price an immense amount.Not sure about his reasons specifically but the general idea is that GameStop is changing its business model as a whole and people are betting that they'll be successful in future despite its recent state of decline.
An analyst who predicted the 2008 crash and profited massively off of it also made the realisation that since the PS5 is coming with an inbuilt disc reader, physical copies of games aren't going to be phased out any time in the near future, hence ensuring GameStop's survivability for at least a few more years. Since then, GameStop has been slowly rallying upwards.
Nothing specifically happened on jan15 that caused the spike in price, but rather it was a product of a culmination of events.

There are a few investment firms betting a significant amount that GameStop will go bankrupt, and are looking to profit off its crash. Profiting off a downward movement in a stock is known as "shorting". Shorting works by borrowing a stock with a promise to return it at a later date. You sell the borrowed stock while its price is high, then buy it again when its price drops. When time comes for you to return the stock to its original owner, you still return them the same amount of stock, which you got at a lower price, hence profiting. 

However, if the price of the stock keeps going up, the shorter will lose money, and at a certain point the shorters will be forced to cover their losses and buy the stock at a higher price. When they buy more stock it causes the price to go up even further, leading to more losses for other shorts, creating a sort of feedback loop of shorters trying to cover their losses and pushing the price further and further up. This is what's known as a "short squeeze"  and is what's happening with GME. It just so happens that on Jan14 the shorts likely decided that it's time to cover some of their losses.

There's further suspicion that the GME shorts aernt playing fair for reasons too technical for me to explain, and users of this sub have submitted complaints to the SEC. But the main gist of it is that there's a possibility of the price of GME going way higher when shit hits the fan for the big short players.
If you would like further reading on this phenomenon you can look up the short squeeze of Volkswagen when it briefly became the most valuable company in the world in 2008.Yes a tiny amount (relatively to his gains).  
He explains why on his YouTube channel.Bought up GameStop shares and calls at the bottom, they went up since then, with 60/70% increase today alone.This is literally what people have been telling him for a year. If he ever listened to wsb, he wouldn't be where he is today.

He could realistically hit 10-20 million in the next several weeks.Yes, that is how options work.

No, you will never be able to do it.

Yes, you should still try.The old and poor get the rope,  not the tendies.Happy cake daydoes the april part mean he can't sell till april?Started with a 50K investment.  The jump in basis is from sale of options to buy 40K more
shares recently.A guy that bought options back in 2019 for a seemingly dying "blockbuster of gaming" type of company and everyone ridiculed him for it back then.

I believe he started with around 140k and is now sitting at 5.8m, with more room to grow. He is the gamecock, the share soared by 60% making him about 2.5mil just today.You just feel it in the base of your nutsackLook at his post history. He’s been doing updates back when he first put in 50k and everyone clowned him for ‘making a bad play’Huh?

Are you actually on the spectrum or are you fair game?He started with $50k.You might want to research the King while inside the castle, jsDawg he bought all that wellllllllll before it was worth 6mit's been talked about for around 4-6 months. Ryan Cohen one of the cofounders of Chewy.com bought a very sizeable amount of shares. There were also a shit ton of shorts. it turned into a perfect storm you could say. and after yesterdays news of Cohen and some Chewy members joining the board with Cohen it took off today right after Jim Cramer tweeted about it. at this point it's launched so high that the shorts have to cover their positions which causes it to pump more, there's still many shares left that are short so it will probably continue. but who knows now that it's known across the internet.  

This is all news that is very obtainable and not "it was obvious" it was always a gamble, but a very good gamble. what you said is the same thing everyone said when Disney first announced Disney+ , many knew there was a high possibility they would disclose the new service during investor day, yet tons of redditors couldn't believe people were making 10 baggers without being insider info. they just don't follow the news and rumors. it's that simple, but people rather believe it's something nefarious.You know hilariously I don’t know why this isn’t obvious but just look at new console release which is usually a once in decade event. Maybe not decade but 6-10 years. Every bump is correlated with the new PlayStation. Such a shocker isn’t it

You could have seen this 2 years early. Michael Burry letter last year should’ve convinced youit's worth 5.7 million you donkeyHe bought those calls a while back when they were .07 and .40 cents per contract. Those same calls have multiplied in value like crazy (see what he paid for and how much it’s going for now per contract).Anyone?Run away retardban this doodHe had $40k in march, doesn't even own his house (him and his partner rent), people here were saying he'd lose it all in GMEWhere have you been broWelcome to the retarded sideYou see something like this, you bow like a mere mortal.... this is the way.All you need to know is you ain’t that guy, and you ain’t never gonna be that guyDo you see the column that says "day gain"?

I don’t think today was a “major” short squeeze. An important sign of a “major” short squeeze is that the stock becomes “easy to borrow”, GME is still hard to borrow which means most short sellers didn’t give up today...So you're saying we should all double down?This may be the case and mean the trade is still alive but i watched gme on its way up 90% and i have never seen that type of buying conviction before... especially if it was someone going long.  

That said, if it was not complete short covering, what is the short interest now?

Could NOT WAIT for this post. 5.7 mill, from what, 70k??Tesla didnt rocket like this. Steady gains over months is not quite as crack like as 60 percent in one fucking day.

I bought more GME today, lolNot even tesla rose 60 percent in one day lolI don't have a lot to put into a portfolio, about 2k, but I had 12 shares of GME and that little bump in my portfolio made me happy. I don't have the best understanding of options, did options trading do even better than the stocks?High AFThis is like once every few years thing.Is it silly to buy shares now? Is there still an expectation that GME will continue to grow? I can maybe buy 10... lolWhen it hit 10% up on the day I said to myself wow that's a great day. Then it hit 20% up and I said holy shit. Then it hit 30% up and I said oh my God is the squeeze happening. Then it hit 40%. Then 50. Then 60. Then 70. Then 80 fucking percent up. Now it didn't finish 80% up but holy fuck. But that does mean that like you I was just staring at the screen for a good portion of the dayDamn. $8K in a day is something to be proud of. Hope you get more.If you do, please buy a Tesla.Crash it, then use the insurance money to buy more GMEI saw green pre-market and told my boss to fuck offRight, fuck that 9 to 5Last night I made comments on Webull "look at the bollinger bands and bull flag. This baby is gonna pop tomorrow"... I quit options but was gonna buy GME calls today. I saw it was up 5% pre market and was like " ahh too late it'll dip..." 

Here I am feeling retarded. I wish I would've looked yesterday but I took a mental health break from tradingNo shit, this is my favorite sport for sureSame, next exam in a few days, fuck mesame, entrance exam tomorrow - up 12k, has to be a good sign for tomorrowuh, this year retard.Dfv hands for shortThere needs to be DFV award we can give instead of diamond for the most autistic plays of all time.

Also, all the proceeds should be donated to autism’s in need; not the ones on wsb.It's more like diamondillium now.yesWhat does DFV stand for?Just didHe’s gonna exercise the calls. He has just enough cash + margin to exercise the call.But it doesn't make sense not to sell then buy the shares. You keep the extrinsic value.No one here knowsYesOr he’s going to hold for the jump tomorrow ?Almost 2 years ago, such a visionaryBro there is over a million in the 1/15s or 20% of his total portfolio😂😂🚀🚀💎🙏Deep Learning? DEEP VALUE!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I’d back the Pope allowing this man to bang everything under the sunbig schlonga longa dingdong12 inches and growing.SqueeeeeeeeezeAnd have Micheal Burry be the god-king that inspired itThe big deep fuckingStill unreal to me that batman played michael burryHe can be my daddy if he wantsthis guy eats ashe and fire. true legendI think most of our excuse is we don't have 700k to gamble like that.The only thing he needs to worry about now is what color lambo he wantsDon’t forget the IRS waiting to spread his cheeks straight after sellingI was talking purely on today's gains, not the total. So 80K a year, which I believe you could retire on, but not necessarily comfortably depending on inflation.Them taxes gong to eat the shit out of that windfall. Still enough to retire though.or if he yolos everything into $agnc he can live off a few thousand a day> On a 3% withdraw (so never run out of money)

We don't live in a world with Treasury Bonds at 3% anymore.This is definitely what I would do. I’ll never be in this position because I don't have the balls. I’m hesitant to do options.Just the largest buy is 750k. Guy was already rich.He actually only started with 53k, but as calls expired he bought more calls and shares, so it increased his cost basisHe actually only started with 53k, but as calls expired he bought more calls and shares, so it increased his cost basis

Additionally, you are ignoring his large number of shares, so that is a hedge already compared to his options.u/j1187064 have you apologised?The comments. THIS IS WHY YOU MUST HAVE CONVICTION.Remember how wrong that moron u/j1187064 was?Lol, check out [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpwjy8/gme_yolo_monthend_update_oct_2019/f60dsd8/).

Also clicked through to Zer033x’s profile (the person who's telling him he's an idiot)...he last logged in 9 months ago to say “I only do short plays lately.” 

So, uh... RIP /u/Zer033xWhy March?His self-reply to post you linked, speaking to Alexa is even more hilariousu/j1187064 hahahaha retard you were such a cocky cock sucker back then look at this now bet you wish you were this guyu/J1187064 how'd you do last year?Fucking legendaryWhat an absolute fucking KING.I fucking jizzedReally incredible as an idiot to read this shit.  Super fascinating.Holy fuck. 

Hire this man as your live in maid.LmaooooAlexa remind u/j1187064 to delete his Reddit.I think exercise is the big dick move, But this man is playing 4D chess so whatever he does will be the right play....but wait, there's more!!!So I'm not trying to argue, but how can we confirm that. People wete saying shorts haven't moved all day but the only evidence I saw shared was only accurate as of 12/31.

Selfishly, I am asking because I want to make my first option play on GME tomorrow, but I want to ensure that we haven't missed the boat with a bunch of paper hands suppressing the squeeze action.so you're saying wait til next week and then beat your dick in the exec meeting instead.This wasn't a squeeze at all. Like only 1-5% covered and it wasn't even melvin probably. We have so, so, so much more to go. That's why nobody has sold yet.How do you know the short interest?This would be too much for my heart to handleHow do you check short interest? Yahoo only provides data from December 30th and I couldn't find anything newer. Thanks!He’s gonna double that Jan 15th call by next week!!!!!How do you track short positions in real time? You can see open interest in puts but those are dwarfed by the already open shorts. Not to mention volume was 14x normal today which means people could have been covering.What is the updated short interest?Plus he could keep fucking around and work for a little bit, let the principle grow...at the end of the day though, this guy fucking made ithe held for a year+, and sold around \~2-3M alreadyWhat if he’s in a tax advantaged accountHurry up Elon I need my fat fireDepends where you want live. 

160k in a big costal US city is nowhere near fatfire. Fire for sure, but not fatFire. 160k is nice dinners, fly first class domesticly, and a new 2bdr townhouse money, but it's not yachts, private jets, [rent a submarine money](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/ih7bcx/annual_costbudget_needed_to_own_a_private/).

In southern or middle of the US city though, yeah, you can live pretty damn well on that (still no submarine though).

Edit: Ya'll can down vote me all you like but it doesn't make me wrong. The top posts from the last week that mention net worths or salaries are:

- 3.8m net worth (they mention living in a MCOL city)

- 11m net worth

- 1m/yr income

- 800k/yr income

- 7m net worth

- An unspecified 8 figure net worth

Don't get me wrong, I'd looooove to have 4m in my pocket, but 160k/yr is not fatFire in a major US city.at this point he’s just stacking money for his kids, fucking wildY’all wild. If I hit $300k I’m going PT. $500k and I’ll probably quit.Me too, difference between me and him will be that it takes me 30 years to get to that number inflation willing.Homeless or dieI think a cool alternative is divide the amount into 10 or 20 pieces.  So for him at 5 million, 1/2 million blocks to ride various risky trade ideas.  .5M in PLTR, .5M in Steel and various WSB memes...but make sure the risk between the difference risky bets are corralated.2.69*

*NiceMillion MoneyzWhoa mister huge dick over hereThis is how diamond handed DFV is

Even as GME shot up to $38 and those Jan 20c went to like $18-$19, i knew he wasn't selling. 

Even as we faded throughout the day. I knew I'd see those 1,000 contracts at EOD.

2.6 mil in one day. Mother. Fucking. King.Theta on that dropped exponentially since they became ITM today. He’s safe and will probably exercise 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀Edited, thanksCan you link to it pls?Not every smart person can make big money in the stock market but every person making big gains in the stock market are extremely smart.

I've never seen single person in my life that have poor intelligence but make money in the stock market.

See every person posting big longterm gains in WSB, they are software engineer working in big tech, hedgefund manager or doctor, already successful and really smart people.I hope you're aware it's a copy pastanobody tell himThis is golden poetry! Lol1875 Socrates was the best SocratesStopped reading after high iqI don't know what happened but I'm retarded and hereHow big of a diff in profits if you don’t have enough cash? I thought most places will cover it for you if you’re excercising and selling immediatelyit will skyrocket cause melvin needs to buy shares to cover the positionAnswer; probably, but maybe only a 1-2% differencedeepfuckingvaliumUnobtaniumHe said he was going to exercise them i think so that’s why he’s still holding themThat’s shit the Black Panther wearsI suspect that his diamond hands will fuel *a lot* of WSB bankruptciesObviously it worked but how is this not pure dumb luck with the timing? I'm happy for the guy but I hope people don't try to replicate thisYeah he's got neutronium hands boys, helps that it resembles neutron degenerate matter because this autist is a true fucking degenerate himself and hats off to him.No, this is proper diamond handing. The rest of the shit we do is merely aluminum or steel handingNeutron star handsPure elemental AutistumThe material you are describing is the material his balls are made ofDFV hands.of course it’s because they’re made of retardiumDFV HandsThis fucker has Tungsten handsSignedYou know how many top tier wives he can afford now, two ain’t gonna cut itWe must offer him the pile.*'ll tell you what I'd do, man, two ~~chicks~~ wives at the same time, man.*How about he runs a train on our wives???holupDont have a wife how about my camelThe conviction of that shit head is truly incredible, and to see just how wrong he is today is even more amazing. 

That comment thread should also serve as one hell of a warning to people on this sub who let others convince them to make a play, one way or the other. Don’t listen to the advice that people give you on the internet. (Unless their name is u/DeepFuckingValue and then you’re a certified retard for NOT listening.)They have locations, a brand, and customers + supposed tech revolution comingCan someone fact check that, that really doesn't seem rightFOMO is a hell of a thing when it comes to this subreddit.Bloomberg article said it probably wasn't the squeeze. Short interest hasn't changed much. Maybe some shorts got squeezed but the big shorts are still in.I thought I was mad retarded for holding onto my 4 dollar nio sharesI’m new to this sub. What’s that mean and what’s going on?Not to late?Did he tell you to stop? We should all be continuously jumping until we are all slathered in gains.Yes70k not 7Yes you can only lose your investment in calls. Puts can have extra loss to infinity if it continues to rise.Shit you right where’s the line startMods hate me"if you misused the flair, please change it."

Doesn't say he did misuse it, just warning himAdamantium handsJeebus.At this point I think he's gonna exercise them and keep holding the shares. He's in this to the end it seemsLooks it up, I hope the guy who sold him these options doesn't do anything drastic when January 15th rolls aroundAhhh, that makes sense! 

And thank you very much for the very helpful answer. 

I think Gamestop has had the image of something that is on it's deathbed for a while. 
Especially with the new generation of consoles, and the possibility of games going digital only. 
And it's debatable if it should just die in peace, but this is just a very fun example of "Reddit intervention". 

P.s: Sending you a giant virtual hug and a pad on the shoulder, for your service at Gamestop. I hope you are okay to this day.Wasn’t it luck that the prominent investor got involved though?  OP didn’t know that would happen.Ah yes now i understand it thank youYeah, but I'm too busying buying GME rneven at $32/share? which is crazy because it was $20 just yesterdayNo, he started with about $53k.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1g7x0/hey_burry_thanks_a_lot_for_jacking_up_my_cost/I'm in GOEV too brother. I don't think we should be complaining about being up 30% in the past 5 days, though 😂 our time will come brother. In @ $12.20 and I'm not fuckin selling!Late I know, I’m 1.5 months into Reddit just getting caught up!  $100 up on appl calls today and spreading my wingsDon’t know what that meansGahdamn. Next time I’ll know. All it takes is a couple big ones before a popReminds me of my furthest OTM put options possible that I bought when the covid crash started on the TQQQ. They went up like 500% in one day and I sold. Had 2 weeks on it. Probably would’ve been rich lolThank you sirOh I got that, but what does the info on each column mean?[deleted]okay good i feel betterDamn I bout in yesterday....perfect timing lmao. This guy is on another levelGod damn, I guess it's gonna be a sequel. The Bigger Shorter staring yours trulyI’ve seen the posts but 50k to 5m isn’t as impressive as $73 to 1M. Who doesn’t have $73?Right but that one trade alone 1/15. That’s what I was talking about.Because that’s some shit you only do if you know somethinThat’s what I thought. Unbelievable.What changed? Why didn't it go bankrupt?Got it, so he can buy 100 shares x 1000 contracts which is 100,000 shares. Gain is share price - contracted price, correct?Lmaooo noooooo I really do want to do this!After reading this a few times this is what I've got. Is it right?

He went long by agreeing to buy 

- 1000 futures at $20 in 2 days (cost of this was $72.6)

and 

- 1000 futures at $12 in 4 months (cost of this was $400)

right? 

By the fact that gains are 1million instead of 10k, I'm guessing each future is 100 shares.

He also owns 50k shares outright bought at $15, which are now worth 30 ea.

Did he effectively turn $500 into 3 million or did I horribly misread some part of this?They’ll only expire worthless if the the calls aren’t in the moneyAnd you guys will call me Diamond Hands??Thank youthanks!That much is true. I am a retard. No idea how I got approved for options trading lol.ohhh i see it now. Thanks.Yeah i never operated with options!
But in case he doesn't have that kind of money, he can just sell the options for -almost- the same profit, right?
edit: whats the point on exercising the calls? I only see it as a PRO if you really want to get the stocks and keep holdingSome are apart of it with the goal to never have to work again... So yea. A few million needs budgeted to last if you're young.Thanks yes I saw the lord’s history, but in RH for example if I wanted to buy anything like a Jan 21/2022 42c and up, there’s no contracts to buyIf I wasn’t stupid I would’ve been rich by now....why would it go up and hit$40?That doesn't really change the problems I mentioned. GameStop is at the same place Blockbuster was after Redbox and Netflix got super successful. There's a ticking clock on the brick and mortar game stores and I don't think a new board member is going to change that. And my point is not that I'm right because even if I'm wrong I wouldn't understand why I was wrong and not understanding something is a stock I stay away from. That's all I was saying.Well then okayWhat’s his YT?What I mean is who pays out? Where does that money come from?[deleted]Ok thanks for clarifying.No, it means he has until April to be right. He's already right. Hence all the green.Took the words rifhr out of my mputhWho the fuck has 50k to YOLO away?He’s been in this play since 2019, check his post historyYou're right, I'm retarded.Cuz the underlying went up ??

GME 🛸🛸🛸What about “Melvin paid for this” 🔥  🔥  🔥Well GameStop probably will go under before long, doesn’t mean you can’t make money from them in the mean time thoughwhat kind of retard doesn't give up after a 80% surge?What indicator do you check to see if a stock is easy to hard to borrowMay have done better if we hadn’t minted the peaches.would you mind putting this in english for me? Squeeze is when a stock goes in either direction from a lot of buying/selling?Confirmed! Buying more shares and calls tomorrow!Gonna wait to see what happens premarket before going in againduh you retard, its going to $420.69Sure you’re part of the dip this morning 🧐My super basic and retarded understanding is a stock rising enough to get everyone who shorted the stock (bet that it would crash) to panic, realize it's not going to tank, and cutting their losses before it rises even more, which causes it to rise even more. It's worth googling "short squeeze"I also did nothing but refresh the screen....which is funny as I have no GME shares700k loli think the OG yolo was around 50kQuestion from a new retard. If you do a call and make 70k let's say from a 10k premium. At expiration would you have to fork that 70k personally to get your 70k then sell? 1 option. And the other option getting your premium plus what you made in difference? Pretty much what I'm asking is how the fuck do you make money on calls .Same here. I bought 1K more shares. Pussied out on buy LEAPs yesterday. My conviction is nowhere close to DFV’s.Thank you for your serviceA buddy of mine put me onto Zomedica at $0.17 last month which rallied to $1.45 before cooling off to around 90c, watching it go up 100% in a day got me addicted, ready to cash out my 401k for meme stocks nowMe too ༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ

AND

I will be buying tomorrow

Shorts have to cover sometime!

GME 🛸🛸🛸Would it be worth it for a n00b with not a lot of cash to throw around to put a few hundred into it at this point? Or is it still a go with your gut thingdude! And it was OVER 100% at one point today. Like When it hit 38.50 I almost could not look away from my phone for 10 minutes straight.90% at one pointI picked up more shares too. Up to 103 with an average buy of $20.30Today?? Do you not think this is the peakAt this point, if TSLA rose 60% in one day, the SEC would probably close the markets for a month to avoid its market cap overcoming the world's GDP.Why is GameStop going up? I'm out of the loop. I thought they'd be an obsolete company.Nope. I have 100 shares bought at 19.xx, and planning to buy more at mkt open tmrwNo, I just went back for more!YesOn the cybertruck waiting listI’m my own boss and I just up and killed myself.

I'm gonna guess you didn't read before commenting which means you belong here.Q1 earnings I guesshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJoBMayjlUoDoes $GME make mounds and mounds of Julienne Fries?Serious!!! There is that much more out there?!?I'm pretty sure we won't know for weeks.

But, over 100 million shares traded for no apparent reason. That's a value of 3 billion, trading in one day. The company is worth less than that amount, in total market cap.

Something big happened today. The size of the volume doesn't even make sense unless you believe almost every single short was closed today all in one mad rush. I think 70 million are short...so if the majority of them were covered today that might explain.

Though, that would be *incredibly* stupid for short sellers because as soon as they kick the price up that much they risk having algos come in to ride the wave. It would be far better for them to edge out over a period of weeks.

Nothing about the action today makes sense. Suddenly the whole country wants gamestop stock?You could always buy puts instead. 

If you hate money.You missed the boat. I doubt 1% of the users on this sub have diamond hands. They are all talk and want you to buy in so you can hold their bags. When GME hit the $30’s today the smart ones sold and the rest are going to let their options expire worthless. 

People will continue to try to pump GME here while offloading their positions until GME becomes the new PLTR and the sub moves to the next meme stock.Anybody have any ideas as to what prompted OP to invest in GME way back?Stock goes up 70% in a day.

Hope I didn’t miss the boat!I'd like to know too, if you have any info please reply. The volume indicates something that's for sure, so I got outExactly. They are wrong. Short holdings get reported every two weeks.>How do you track short positions in real time?

You have to pay for this data.Man if you keep working with that stash you’re just wasting time not enjoying life. You could be in a car wreck or get diagnosed with cancer at any time. Unless you love your job, you’re just being a greedy bastard imothere's 0 point working at this level.Most people don't think of "yachts, private jets, and rent a submarine" as FatFIRE. FatFIRE is living large, but not living like a hundred-millionaire. Most people over at /r/fatfire are targeting numbers like this: 4MM, sometimes as high as 10MM, but generally in this range. Regular old fire/leanfire takes a good deal less than 4MM.

What you're describing is like obeseFIRE or something."if it floats, flies, or ducks, you're better off renting it" private jets are the worst thing to own ever, out company does hundreds of millions of dollars and that jet just bleeds money.

There should be enough volume to cover that.Fuuuuck me I’m YOLOing my entire portfolio into GME 21c 4/16 at market open tomorrow

u/zUltimateRedditor

I told you, buddy!!Who tf is melvinBut even if he doesn't exercise and sells, someone will eventually have to exercise it right? (whoever ends with it)Will the price skyrocket cuz they sold naked calls?Wouldn’t it be of interest to just sell the calls instead of executing the option? Like what’s actually drivin the price? I heard chewy execs joined the boardVibraniumGive me a prescription for that!I had to take a couple Valium today watching my account swell like a balloon. WHAT A RUSH.BadassiumSo he will buy another 100k in shares at the price of $12 (1.2mil cost) just for the 12c option.  The stock is worth $31 just as of now, with room upwards to go and no more expiration.  

So about 2mil is current value (similar to the option value listed) with *less* risk by owning actual shares

All from a start at .40cents/$40k starting point.He only has enough cash to exercise about half of them. Someone is gunna make a good chunk of change exercising 500 1/15 20c for himIf this prints even more for him tomorrow, I'm just going to assume he's leagues more intelligent than everyone here.This is both the right and wrong subreddit for this. BravoA camel toe is a camel toeIt’s right but I didn’t fact check itAfrica's GDP is literally 1 million times higher.

Although that's in a year with a billion people, so on a per day basis he's done the work of 365,000 Africans.All of africa and USA is in debt so yeah it make sense.I aint missin outI thought short interest was only released every few weeks?The stock has been over shorted!  In basic speak, assholes betting against the stock short sold more shares than there are of the actual stock to buy, which is illegal.  GameStop has a lot of value still and stockholders know that.  The short sellers keep trying to beat the price down because they have unlimited risk if the stock price starts to rise to fast for them to buy back their shorted shares.   The squeeze is what happens when all the short sellers try to vacate their position, the buy back their shares, increasing the share price, and compelling more short sellers to do the same.  Last one holding the short bag at the top gets completely wrecked, and all the GME gang makes shitload of money.   

What happened today was based off of the board of directors restructure and holiday sales and a ton of new interest in where this company is going.  It’s possible that some of the short sellers started to liquidate their positions today but it isn’t the big squeeze yet so there is still time to get on.  

I believe that this is currently the most shorted stock right now.   All the publicity it is getting is a good thing as people will probably want to jump on before it really pops off.There is a days to cover number floating around that you can look up which is how long it is expected for all the shorts to buy out there positions, and it is several days if not over a week or more, so once the squeeze happens it should take place over several days.  Hold on until you can’t hold on anymore.  Even if it doesn’t squeeze this stock should be a good long term play.The squeeze hasn’t even started.  I bet those fuckers are scared though.  The rocket just did a static fire.  Hop on before it’s too late Holmes.DFV is Simon?.... makes senseWhen buying options you can only lose the value of the purchased options. When selling options, puts can only go to 0 from your strike, calls can go to infinity if they are not covered.Only if you don’t own stock though right (as in only if you are short selling)He’s already finishedWhooshWho knows, the stock market is a circus.

Lol thanks, I’m alright, we only got robbed twice!It’s like seeing a big field, watered and fertilized, and saying, “I bet a plant will pop up here.” Something was going to happen with a company with so much potential.undervalued (1.4bn market cap in huge industry) loyal customers, lots of data 
Cohen - look at Chewy/the other guys he brought onto the board 
potential for short squeezeI'm in for 1300 shares at 17 and bought 150 more at 31. Might liquidate everything tomorrow and go all in.I stand correctedLmao, fly brotha!!  I am by no means a big fish.  I make about 100 bucks a day, and I lose about a hundred bucks a day in the market ( while I go to work and make about 16 an hour to pay my rent).  Who cares about what you read on wsb.  Whatever you're doing sounds like it's working.  Profits, are profits!

Edit.  But for real, did you actually buy IN TODAY?  i've been pondering the short squeeze on gme for over a month now.  Never bought in.  I almost took yesterday's change of government as a sign to buy in...

 Didn't.Do you need to be spoon fed? Google “short squeeze” and “VW 2008”.Yeah it's insane. Like, if I had just put $200 in RH and yolo'd that for 100 contracts, I would've made $161,000 had I timed it perfectly lol.  Even if you don't, you're at the very least leaving the day with a 100 baggerI feel that man. I had calls in July for AMZN for a $2900 strike price. This is when it mooned like $4-500 in a three day span. I spent $500 on two calls that I sold for 1k total profit but had I waited 24 hours those calls would have net me 40kNope,  2.686mil today. 572k on shares and 1 mil each (and change) on both of his 2 options.The Big Short 2: Attack of the 🌈🐻sstill pretty fucking amazing. did you see that guy who turned 60 bucks into 17k today ?Ah okay, you mean he should have sold those calls for Jan 15 because it seemed as though it was unlikely they would come up trumps? 

What if he just let them expire? He'd lose the 7k placed on them?Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy, took interest and has a plan for their turnaround. He took significant stake into GME, upped that position it in Dec, and it was just announced this week that him and two of his former heads at CHEWY were all brought onto the board of GME.


Bottom line. Shorts are fucked. GME has risen once a fucking gainYou got it. There’s more nuance to the intrinsic value of options but that’s close enough.Well, evaluate your personal risk tolerance and try not to end up working behind your local Wendy’s. 
Tendie Hill is made of the bodies of many an autist. For every winner, there are many losers, and this is a zero-sum game. 

That being said, if you’re tired of regular old nihilism, wsb is a great place to engage in capitalistic extreme nihilism. Godspeed.He bought all these a long ass time ago. These are options. The price paid is per share and each option is worth 100 shares. So really he turned $47,000 into $3 Million. Also turned $744,735 into $1.57m via shares. It ain't much, but it's honest work.He is making calls, thats why the insane increase. His is a diamond hand god because he hasn't sold, even after todays wild ride. He has inspired all of us to hold on and buy in more! You too can be this retarded.no problem. we’re all idiots hereYea he can just sell them. Assuming theres people out there willing to buy

Its hard to say because those are so in the money with a near expiration. So he’s better off just exercising.That’s my goal but I want enough to live comfortably, not budget frugally and hope it lasts.He rolls them out every few months for whats availableWho pays for it? The buyers pay for it. Same place money comes from if a house or a car goes up in priceBecause its going up tomorrow retardIf they don’t already know abt deep then they arent from here. Fucking idiotLook at his post history and find out.He started last year with 40k on gme and now he's here today. Big brain.Can u do math?Go back to his original posts, smooth brainBro just look at his post history. It’s all thereHe has 3 plays. The first one I get - yeah he needed a lot to buy the stock. But the middle one he only spent $7k, the bottom one he spent $40k.  He didn't have to spend anywhere near $700k to do the options plays.  The middle one alone is probably the most impressive.  Just a measly $7k -- > $1M. That's basically just turning some stimulus checks, a tax return, and a little bit of savings into $1+M.**THE KING IN THE TARDS!**In the land of no brains, the man with half a brain is a genius.King of gamecockHahhahaha good oneSwuboo

EDIT: wrong game!  I'm a moron.Have you seen this guys cock? No 🌈🐻 could handle him.People that belong here posting their loss porn.Yesterday I was overall up more than 110% on my GME shares. The shorts didn’t give up during that run up. So here is your answer: the kind that has been shorting GME!I may be wrong but i think market makers shorted more stock in order to prevent a real squeeze, where they would lose billions probably, at one point the stock was rising over a doller a minute, but they managed to break that trend, it's better for them to slowly exit their short position than to lose them in a real squeezeIs...is wsb shorting GME? Only we are this retardedSame kind still holding out hope after Cohen got involved months ago. And again after he joined the board.The same people who post loss porn around here. Diamond hands work both ways.We need a few 80% days until we get to the price target of $420.69If he pulled out after an 80% gain he would have cashed out last year with $90k100%ONE OF US ONE OF US ONE OF USMelvin CapitalSomeone who calls his fund Melvinwell, mine maximum loss when shorting XPEV was over 100% :) but i diamond handed it to around 20% before covering my short positionsUs?pppl who have way more money than you and can hold their shorts for yearsThis retard. I jumped on at the top today then had to average down by turning on margins. God speed artistsGoogle itYup, sold as soon as I saw that huge sell-off, sorry 😞 but I had to secure some gainsI did not do anything at work once the markets were open either, shitUse Webulls app for live price streamingThat's his current cost basis but I think that's after he rolled forward gains from previous contracts. I think the out of pocket money he yoloed may have been $70K.Earliest post I could find  
[https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1g7x0/hey\_burry\_thanks\_a\_lot\_for\_jacking\_up\_my\_cost/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1g7x0/hey_burry_thanks_a_lot_for_jacking_up_my_cost/)he started with jan 2023 calls and had around 50k to startI wanted to buy more leaps when GME went up 12% this morning. Then I was like “nah, it’s probably the top” 🤦‍♂️I bought more too. Im a little fish, bought another $200 worth for 25 shares total but fuck it im in the game!Hahahaha see you in the soup kitchenIt hasn't squeezed yet. And valuation should put it at 40 bucks a share. So it's still pretty good.
just look up gme in wsb history for tons of relevant ddthey have been going down forever because of declining sales and shitty management in general

yesterday they reported holiday earnings and it BLEW past expectations, so it swung the other way

also some members in this sub were betting massive amounts of money in PUTS and CALLS increasing the swing and volatility .Do u set the order now already or wait for the market to open to see how it goes?dittoI bought 4 shares of GME and 11 of PLTR. YOLO, right? lolWernstromNetherite handsBreak this down for meDo you not know any of this story? This dude didn’t have millions he made millions off GMEhe bought these so long ago. No way he spent close to a million on this playSir this is a short busIt is when you got several lambos in the bankSuper low mileage lease. 2K miles a year for 3 years. 2K a month, 20K down. Spend almost a hundred grand over 3 years to not even drive round trip across the US.It's an apprciating asset long Lambo 🚀🚀Live on 75k for two years and get the lamboWhy not? You can easily save enough on 150k a year. He can make more money, do other things, etcWhen you have that much in the bank, you can afford to take some spending money out here and there. And when you're making 150k year/ for life, you can splurge more because most of your cash is your savings. You dont need to put money aside like the regular Joe. You LITERALLY have, 150k spending.Normal piss, overhydrated piss, or morning after drinking heavily piss?You can still buy a Lambo on 200k a year easily enough.  Just because you didn't has no real bearing on anything.Tell me you got a new red Sienna.It’s a call option. He’s not going to hold for a year.Wait you Americans pay taxes? 

Laughs in TFSAAnd that’s why you are a retardOptions are still taxed as short term gains, regardless of length of holdingRoth only works for the poors. $130k(?) income limit and $6-7k max deposit per year.Google is telling me u have to pay taxes on all gains if you withdraw before age 59.5 plus a 10% penalty. Seems useless if I cant spend my gains for 30 years. 

What am i missing?You can only get $6k a year into a Roth. Itd take forever to get to this level of a gambleHonestly lol. The funniest shit is people see this post and think they can do it too, and will toss their entire 5k life savings into an option or two and then it’ll all be gone.LMAO let's not roast this man and kick sand in his eyes. We've done enough. Just keep following DFV and hold the fuck out of those shares.I'm gonna laugh my ass off if that guy made fun of dfv, but then was like "eh, fuck it" and also invested a shit ton into gme.Cum in the eye will do that to you.him: "well back to mcdonald's I guess..."so am iPendulum swings both ways. But if you listen to nay sayers you always get bopped.The comment was so long ago (1y) that I assumed he meant earnings of that year not 2021 Q1. Thanks for clarificationWhy yes it does!The short interest dropped 50000 shares today, now it is only 67,980,000 shares shorted...out of 69M shares outstanding.  Ryan Cohen owns 9M ish shares with 13% of the company, Blackrock has 11M shares bought since 2/2020.  So, the shorts are STILL screwed.  I am hoping for another rodeo tomorrow!   DFV is still in,  I'm still in!!!GME is still hard to borrow.

Shorts have not covered.Wouldn't it make sense for them to bow out all at once as a "rip off the band aid" move, they do it all at once to ensure they are the start of the wave and aren't caught up in it? If all the shorts sold, then this means the run is essentially over yeah?After reading DD here last night, I was convinced it'd be held below $24 through Friday, so I was \*totally\* unprepared for the major rip today. I was lucky enough that I hadn't sold my 1/15 calls yet, and lucky enough that I set limit orders at prices that would give me a nice little profit on my cost basis, but NOT lucky (or smart) enough to cancel those limit orders & "wait and see" the incredible rocket that launched :(the word got outWhy even bring this up as a joke? Why would anyone buy puts in the short/mid term with all the facts we know?I mean I have shares, but yeah I guess just hold tight and do research and wait for my next opportunity.Now it's theta gangs time.PLTR I believe is a different game and just waiting for this mysterious lockupnto pass and next er to see what happens, I  cautiously agree with the GME sentiment sold near the top today.I have shares as well, I just also wanted to potentially do a low risk option olay. If this is going to squeeze harder, which has been talked about for months now, why wouldn't I try to maximize gains?I'm starting to feeling like I should have, but idk maybe this was several big players who are trying to force Melvin to crack? IdkDamn, so I guess the options are sell just before if you believe shorts have closed or hold through and hope there's still a bunch left?You could also just work doing what you enjoy.Yeah of course. When I graduated college I got a good sum of money from family members so I went backpacking across Europe. I had enough money to do and get whatever I wanted...I came home and chilled after that for a month or so before starting my job. That was what I envisioned retiring well to be like. Pure freedom. Except for me, I noticed I was happier when I had a goal, something to keep me challenged. I find that in my career now, so for me satisfying my need for challenge is what makes me happy. So if I got that much money or won the lottery I know I would still find a job that challenges me and I enjoy because that's where I'd be happiest. It's different for everyone though.

tl;dr waking up everyday rich but with no purpose gets oldI'll give you that renting a submarine is probably above the fatFire line (that was more a joke anyway), but I think you're wrong about the targets, especially for people who live in major US cities. Almost everyone I see on that sub that is in LA, SF, NYC is targeting 10m at least.

Just look at the top post right now, it's about whether they should hire a body guard for traveling. That's way more than a 160k/year lifestyle choice.

I read fatfire all the time and I can assure you with absolute certainty that 160k in a major US city is not enough to live the type of life that most of the people in there are talking about.Cincinnati. You can get a nice house in a good neighborhood for about $300k!Doubt itmelvin capital has 54,000 put options which is 5.4 million shares. I'm sure all of them are getting exercisedWhy 4/16 21c? That seems rather... arbitrary..melvin capital, they bought 54,000 15 P 7/16 on GMEMetallic hydrogen would be a good suggestion.AutisiumOr he could’ve sold this morning at the spike then can wait till Friday to buy more shares on the cheap since it’ll prob go back downIf those calls are still uncovered, that's going to cause a lot of shares needing to be bought immediately, further driving the price up. I love this.Idk man. Again - he killed it, but the smart move would have 100% been to roll them out last week or even earlier. This is pure weaponized autismYet africa is the richest continent in natural resources. Congo alone is huuuge (bigger than maps show) and has a ridunkkkuluous amount of natural resources. Economic imperealism and exploitation fucked africa hardLmao let's start converting gains into the equivalent of what the average African makes in a year.Thanks! Safe to say it’s a bit too late to jump in on this but I’m guessing Palantir is the next one to jump on from what I’m seeing?Oh man thanks! I might just drop a good amount on it now and see it out although I’m not really sure how to tell when the “can’t hold on anymore” point would be.Thanks for the correction but maybe I read it wrong i was speaking about buying calls/puts, not selling them. But either way I'm a tard so....Believe so yes. I'm not so versed in shorts. But as basics go yeah. Then there's naked calls/puts as well[https://i.imgur.com/1okIten.gif](https://i.imgur.com/1okIten.gif)Why did the potential for short squeeze exist?I only understood about half those words, because I'm not a WSB chad :( maybe one day I'll learnlmfao best of luck m8He's rebalanced his positions a few times, so you can't tell from this post alone. Easy mistake to makeYa it’d be totally worth it because we knew GME would pop off and even if it didn’t +90% in one day we’d still make a profit buying options that expire at the end of the week. Gahdamn I’ve been meaning to get into this. Some guys like “trade like rocket” on Instagram solely do options like this to catch movements and make a killing. I’m joining now lolGahdamn. It really teaches you. Some people take this as you always lose but I see this as a learning opportunity lol.I did not. Technically still working just zoning out to reddit for a bit.No, who??Well he’s gonna exercise them so no, he’ll pay exercise costs and then get to buy all those fuckin shares. It means Friday we’re going green thanks to this gayYea I'll continue to research this stuff. I want to test it out so I can make more but I just don't quite understand it well enough to do that.Lmfao. I love this sub.

Engage all capitalistic extreme nihilism thrusters to the max. My body is ready.So he made a call to purchase 1,000 shares of GME for $0.07 per share and that call option expires on Jan. 15th? And now GME is worth $11.40? So he could sell his contract right now for $11.40 per share? Or he has to wait until the 15th?

Also, what does the "$20 Call" next to Jan15th mean on the left? And how come each GME has a different "Last Price"?

Sorry, trying to learn a bit so I can be in on the excitement.and in the specific case that there is noone willing to buy, and he has not the money to buy all these stocks, he's fucked?Ah crap I have no idea what rolling options means, google time! Thank you kind sir for guiding this autist towards the light!> He could realistically hit 10-20 million in the next several weeks.

But he'll own the stocks, will he not? Does it make any difference if he exercises now vs later? He pays the same price per contract, right?He edited it to “4-6 months” lmfaooo I’m dead he too tarded even for this sorry ass forumExcuse me for not creepinAm I supposed to check every users post history that post a gain? Jesus fuckin ChristWell in the land of the skunk, the man with half a nose is king!Most underrated comment on the internet imoYou deserve a better award, but all I had to give was the gay bear.Sir this is outer space. There are no people. Only autistic aliens👽🚀🛸that makes sense. If they let the short squeeze happen to day they would've literally lost a few hundred billions lol💯💯💯I'm referring to the shorts not covering lolNice, another dip. Reloading on sharesYou’re a fucking idiot. But it’s ok if you buy more shares tomorrow or Friday.Lol I guess everyone here just doesn’t work at workI didn't even get work done when the markets were still closed!Legends say it was even lower... 50k or even 40k...wowzaDamn[deleted]Those comments are the definition of "did not age well". My entire account is up 40% today on the jumpWow, if you Look at how People were shitting on him. But he didnt doubt his vibe. I‘m really happy for him. An myself heheBalls of steel, majestically telling all the early haters to suckleWhy the fuck did he do this? If you had asked any sane person and even most retards if they thought gamestop was undervalued they would have laughed in your face. What possibly could have motivated the sheer ballsiness of this guy?That thread just made me depressed. Not because I did no follow dfv hands to the promise land but because the quality of retards knowledge and lack of rocket ships! What happen to WSBBro, this whole thread is the definition of r/agedlikemilkI won’t bore you with actual numbers but at this market cap currently GME is ridiculously undervalued.

The moon will be in the rear view shortly as we begin the approach to Mars!

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀thanks!Thanks for the answer. This is actually one of my first times on /r/wallstreetbets. I saw this thread on the frontpage.

Last week, I decided to start investing in stocks after a friend's girlfriend finally admitted that she invested in NIO back when stocks were $13/share and she's now sitting on over $10k. I wish she had told me about it when she first invested in it. She got the tip from her employer.Probably just see how it goes; might even buy at pre-mkt if it’s going strongAll of this is so handy.Holding for over a year reduces your taxesif he exercises and holds long enough then he can get long term cap gains tax rate instead of short term cap gains (income tax) rateHis initial outlay was something like $48k.Sir, this is a Wendy'sHoly fuck I howled laughing at this, if I was financially able to afford awards I would!LMAO I’ve never heard this phrase used before and I’ll be stealing it from now on; thank you.... and OP is drivinIs there a Lamborghini short bus? OP should get one.Fuck leasing. I’m buying and doing a Gumball.I’ll sell you those calls anyday.Piss should be perfectly clear r/hydrohomiesI mean yeah, if i didnt have a house, daycare, and save for retirement i could theoretically spend a ridiculous portion of my income on a car.So out of curiosity a new aventador is 421k.  My house was 450.  On a standaed 5 yr loan thats 8500 a month assuming i take out a loan.  At 200k a year my monthly income after 401k and taxes is just under 10k.    Yeah.  Easily!!!
200k - 10% 401k * 65% after taxWhite Honda Odyessey.  To be honest im pretty happy with it!Hes been hard in GME for a year now with posts oftenHe’s been holding the Jan 15s for over a year now, since Dec 2019 I believeYou'll get taxed if u cashout from the TFSA no?That is simply not true... only true if you’re selling options.Only if you try to move the money into a roth, and not make money _inside_ the roth. Not all of them give you full freedoms on what you can invest in, but if you find one that lets your yolo all of your tendies  on calls you dodge all tax until withdrawl.Back door Roth to get around income limits. Then mega backdoor Roth for even more.Roth 401ks have no income limit.I believe non-qualified withdrawals are treated as taxable income, plus 10%. You'll pay more in taxes but who cares when you've got that much? It's all monopoly money at that point.You spend your brokerage account gains until 59.5 then even though you blew all your tendies on coke and hookers behind the wendy's you are still a tax free millionaire via the RothYou’re not missing anything. The benefit of a Roth is no taxes on gains when you’re at retirement. It was never meant to me a way for people to yolo on options and cash out millions tax free at age 19.If you run a small business being a trader you can use a SEP to sock away a lot more money. But that just seems like a lot of steps.I mega backdoor over $30k a year into my Roth IRA.True. I don't think such a low limit exists for a roth 401(k) though. At least, I'm too poor to have triggered it. I always go off the assumption that the average WSBer will start with 4 digits and either blow it or hit it big. This isn't r/investing lolTake $5k and get two ten baggers, you're at 500k tax free. 

Unlikely but people here have done it.You can do a conversion from a traditional IRA into a Roth without any limit.  However, you will have to pay tax that year...So if you want to convert 100K IRA into Roth, you will have to pay income tax on that 100K.I have well into 6 figures in my Roth and I've only been working for 5 years...I’d agree with you if he was just wrong. But he was a douche and wrong. 

I’m allowed to be a douche and right.No. Let’s pry open this douchebag’s throat and shit down all our Wendy’s remainingsAgreed, leave them alone. Except give them the flair: "Gamecuck".this is the wayI fucking hope he didUser flair checks outHim also: "that DFV guy can McFuck himself"Where did you get thisOr they have covered and rest are just bagholding we won’t know til market open, premarket will still be bagholders with nobody buying so price will levitate.  We will see a singular direction am...waiting til thenThe problem with that is that there literally is not enough shares to cover all the shorts. So no matter what they are caught on the ride up to unwind some of their positionsWhat do we know?I’m not saying it’s done sailing but that was the boat leaving port my dudeErrr idk what you’re talking about. Do your DD and build a view on the stock and what it’s worth? The institutional shorts won’t have covered unless they believe their thesis is no longer valid, or if there are technical (non fundamental) reasons that they now think are present which will prevent them from getting paid... like for ex, massive and persistent retail inflows (you guys) combined with a near term lack of catalysts.I'm with gorilla though. I think the great majority of people would be calling themselves quite rich on 160k a year. Especially with no mortgage or rent,. You can call it not-fatfire if you want but man. If I can travel a few times a year and eat and shop without having to look at my bank account that's all I want in life and from retirement.

Don't forget no car payments because you'll have a lambo already. Well, probably a Tesla Model S Plaid for me.Downvoted for speaking  the truth. 

160k is not fatfire. It is fire.  200k maybe is low tier fatfire for a single person.Thanks!I am an options noov and confused. Has melvin sold or bought puts? If they had bought (which makes sense because they are bears on GME) then their puts expire worthless. How does that affect the stock price?Put options wouldn’t be exercised unless they’re ITM. If a bear bought put options and the stock is up 60%, their options (which they paid a lot for) are just going to expire worthless. No exercise involved.Make it 4/20 pussyJesus they're idiots.beskarLOL shut up, you cannot doubt this man.I guess, everyone has different viewpoints on it.

He could have sold the contracts, and the price doesn't 'go back down' then he doesn't have that option to get those shares at 12 bucks without spending more on the premiums to rebuy contracts.I suspect you attend my alma-matterthis is why they want the paris climate accordsyea lets not bud, have a seat over hereI think now is the last chance to get in, maybe a dip tomorrow but it is looking ripe.  I’m sure a lot of GME post squeeze money will make its way to PLTR.  I think I have a feb call that should print.Yeah who knows when that will happen.  I’m strapped in for the long term gains regardless of a short squeeze happens or not.  If it happens I’ll cash and reinvest when it dips.  You can always set a trailing stop, but you just have to watch it so it doesn’t shake you off like what happened today.  Anyone who had a trailing stop would have sold after the peak automatically.  Hopefully they reinvest before it booms again, otherwise they will miss out.When buying, you can only ever lose what you put in. This infact makes it a safe bet.... around here.cos they expected GME to go down the shitter but it hasn’t so they have to coverYou just have to be so careful man. We're seeing all the big winners but there are thousands of losers who don't share. You really have to be okay with losing 100% of what you invest with at any given time.Most brokerages have pretty helpful educational content for options. If you’re just looking at long calls and puts there’s not a lot to it.“Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate”1. Take everything you have, dump into robin hood. Buy GME. HURRY ITS ALMOST TOO LAATEYea but very slim chance. Im sure funds have bots that just eat up in the money options like these. 

Plus theres always a way to find money if you really need to, I heard kidneys go for 200k ish soooSell and reroll it outI said it's been talked about for 4 - 6 months you fuckin retard, that's the first time I remember Sir Jack A lots post or Deeps post. either way that has absolutely nothing to do with me answering the persons question. what the fuck is your deal ?Yes sirAs long as you are perceived to be working, you are working!Or there is me, an idiot: opened Reddit and saw this post after work. I'm a fool.Haha I have been working late many nights and people think I’m working hard. Working late just means starting work at 4 pm and playing catch up.Right? It's crazy that the initial investment was only 30k or 20kYou are ALL wrong.  It was a $20 dollar blow job, his one and ONLY.  He then invested that $20 dollars and the rest is history.

&#x200B;

I am on my 14th blowy and it doesn't get any easier :(Options.  Rather than buy the stock, you can (less expensively) buy the right to buy the stock at a certain price in a certain window of time.  And the value of that right rises when the stock price rises, with higher returns than owning actual stock.

It is much riskier, as that right also depreciates as the window of time that you paid for grows shorter and shorter, often eventually expiring worthless.  (Compare this to holding stock, where if the stock does nothing you simply break even instead of losing everything.)

When Gamestop stock was like $2 a share or something any everybody thought they were done, one could buy the right to buy Gamestock shares at $20 a share for a 6 month window for $0.07 per share (disclaimer: this is made up info to explain the concept, I don't know when OP bought the options).  This would have been crazy, right?  Why would u pay for the right to buy a stock for $20 a share when it is selling for $2 a share on the open market? (In other words, the right to buy a share at $20 only has inherent value if the share is worth MORE than $20 on the open market.)

The reason is because you are a God.  Now that the stock is trading for $31 a share, the right to buy a share of GME at $20 a share is inherently worth $11 (plus a bit extra for the chance of more gains) since one could immediately exercise their right and buy a share for $20 and sell it for $31.  So he paid $0.07 for the right to buy a share, and that right is now worth $11.40.  And he did it for 100,000 shares.Luck was definitely a factor(COVID gaming spur, RC etc) right. But damn did he get it rightPlease bore me with the numbers thoughFuck yaAnd that's how we play handy hands.So you can exercise options into shares without triggering a "sale" according to the IRS?[deleted]That's the way to do it!Yup, he doesn’t need to save for retirementSaving for retirement's cringe lmfaoYour own damn fault

https://i.imgur.com/gNAVbVI.jpgIsn't a Huracan like $200k? I dunno why you'd go for some high end model. May as well go for a Veneno.

Also I though aventadors were more like 350-375Dude just live off of $1500 a month like the rest of us poors 🤣🤣🤣What a legend. I thought his options were from somewhere since the wsb hypeNope, that's the whole benefit of it. Put in after-tax dollars and let it grow tax free + withdraw tax free.At what age can you withdraw money from your Roth though?You can only really backdoor Roth though if you actually work for a company that offers it I believe.


I can backdoor Roth with my 401k contributions at my current company but I'm not working till I'm 60 something years old to withdraw it so I don'tTIL. What’s a mega backdoor Roth?so why open up a roth to leave 10% at the table? 10% of 4M is still 400k, how's that monopoly money?

edit: so I just did some math, let me know if this is wrong:

Roth account scenario:

Starting with $200. Assume you make 5 plays, netting 20% profit each time, you'll have $415. Assume you'll pay %40 tax, which leaves you $307.

Taxable account scenario:

Starting with $200. Assume same profit (20%) and tax (40%) for each play.

Entry Cost/End Price/Tax/Profit

$200/$240/$16/$224

$224/$268.8/$17.92/$250

$250/$301/$20/$280

$280/$337/$22/$314 ---> left with $314. you actually pay 2% more in Roth with early withdrawal penalty.

now if you do $4M instead of $200, that 2% is $150K. Even though it doesn't seem much, it is a significant amount to loose for no good reason.That's about what I've got into your mom.

Tell her I'm sorry I missed breakfast again.Ya we deserve to kick sand in his eyes lolFair enough.Who hurt you?Spot onExperience counts for a lot.lmao

I bet u/DeepFuckingValue will be at 10m$ before u/j1187064 will be out of McDs (sucking Ds for a living ofc)Yahoo financeBut u/Objective_Stage just said, the volume alone shows that a huge number of shorts were closed today, he seems to think it was a very large percentage. If that's the case, then the majority of the squeeze played itself out today.Have you not seen all the rocket emojis?That reading these comments gave me all the autism I need to sustain me.Ryan Cohen is the more handsome Elon Musk of e-commerceThats cool my shares are still printing so its all good. Probably better i do some actual research and make a real play lolI mean that's what my heart tells me: that if anything, NOW was be when the shorter think their thesis is blown up and will start panicking. But my head says I can't possibly get this lucky so I'm becoming a 🌈🐻 out of fear.Who says there's no mortgage or rent though? If you're taking out enough money to buy a house in cash (assume 1.5m to buy a decent place in a major city) then your safe withdrawal rate drops to about 100k. That's still enough to live a fantastic life, but again, it's not on par with what the people in fatFIRE talk about.

> If I can travel a few times a year and eat and shop without having to look at my bank account that's all I want in life and from retirement.

I'm totally with you here, I'm not saying I wouldn't take that lifestyle. Shit, I'd take it in a heartbeat. All I'm saying is that it's not on par with the way people in fatFire are living.Right?!

I think people just don't want to hear it because it makes them sad even 5m dollars isn't enough to live the life they're dreaming of.

Also, just want to clear something up, I am in no way shitting on DFV. Dude is a baller and I'd chop off my leg to be in his position, all I'm saying is that it's "fire" and not "fatFire" if you live in a super HCOL area like LA,SF, or NYC.MM are going to hedge those puts by selling shares. When they expire, the MM is going to buy back shares. Probably. Technically they don't have to buy they need to keep an orderly market, and if they can't cover the calls people buy they'll go bankrupt. So they will.Look up 'perfect hedge'. The broker buys put options and sells call options so that the risk is completely eliminated.This is the wayMithrilYou think it’ll keep going tomorrow and Friday?He's literally holding the cash in hand which is just enough to exercise the calls.PossibryThat's basically what I was getting at lol. Naked puts on PLUG tho cant go tits up ;)Sorry to sound stupid but can you elaborate further, you mean they expected it to go into administration, but because it didn't. The shareholder options required covering?I know, I don’t like wasting money. But dropping 1 or 2k on something that’s a fairly safe bet to make money while also having the possibility to multiply seems like a good deal to me. I don’t like doing yolo options eitherGot it. Do you need a margin account for this or just an investment account? I'll use the Fidelity information section to read up on this stuff.Oh lawd. I'll split it with BB?lol. Thanks!Right so he could exercise the options and then sell his newly acquired stock.Nah you edited that 😂😂doodoodunderheadIf you're at your assigned desk, you're workingDon’t question the man in a $6,000 suit. Come on!Some say it was an advance on a $1200 stimulus checkI like how you explained that.Should be mentioned that if the opposite situation arose, that it was UNDER $20 after 6 months, the contracts would be worth absolutely jack. So he literally risks 100% of his buy in this wayBut in this case the max he would lose would be his initial investment if the price had gone down, right? He wouldn't be in the hole more than what he paid for options.So based on this chart he convinced someone to let him buy GME at 7 cents a share?/r/lostredditorsGrow a pair mate.In particular the retarded, if that makes you feel better.Call me crazy.  Ill take the kids over the car.So 4250 of 9500 ... almost 50% of my income on a carDaycare alone is 3200 a month.That’s our Roth IRA,  tax free growth except only call withdraw after 59.5Boomer ageAny time you want, and you only pay tax on the _earnings_ you pull out. If you toss 10k in there, make 20k on a yolo, you can still pull out the principle balance without paying a cent in penalties.

> You can withdraw contributions you made to your Roth IRA anytime, tax- and penalty-free. However, you may have to pay taxes and penalties on earnings in your Roth IRA. 

After that you just pay tax on what you pull out, while keeping the vast majority of your money untaxed and at maximum investment potential. Why pay tax on $5 million when you could just pay tax on $150k each year? You still pay tax sure, but it's not even 1% of your total worth each year which will only grow larger.100% you do not need to work for a company that “supports” backdoor Roth’s. 

I do a backdoor Roth every year and it has nothing to do with who I work for (aside from the fact that the money that goes into my IRA does have to be from income made). 

If you meant your company has to support mega backdoor Roth’s, then yeah that’s true since you ha e to use a 401k to fund it that route. But regular Roth IRA backdoors are independent of your company and have nothing to do with 401ks.You can google for more info but long story short is you can route money through your 401k to a Roth IRA and go beyond the 6k limit.Yeah, I don't think taking it out will usually be worth it. What is worth it is doing once you get a large amount (easier to grow it tax free) is to do what's called Substantially Equal Periodic Payments. Google does a better job of explaining than I would.Okay Big Boot Boris.So which Wendy’s do you work at, asking for a friend??This and also you wouldnt expect price to come back down that fast I mean it was done by noonMy target for fatfire is 10m. I'd  settle for fire ate 5m. Neither will get me a sub rental. 

I'm also happy living  in a small apartment and traveling  a lot.

A pet giraffe would be nice though. 


None of this has anything  to do with the ridiculous  GME gainz.Dude, you and I are not worthy to sully DFV's name with our doubts!!this guy is why the anti vaxxers existNot for long calls/puts. You’ll need a margin account if you want to get into spreads or other more advanced strategies though.yeah what did I say 4 months? so I edited it to 4 -6 months ? so what? it's a recollection not a fucking fact you retard. the fuck is wrong with you ?Yep, exactly. Now using the exact numbers from the chart, he bought the right to buy 100,000 shares at $20 a share expiring January 15, 2021 for $0.0726 per share, or $7,260.  That was his max loss (on that line in his chart.)Not exactly. It’s more like, “Hey, I’ll give you $7 (.07 per share for 100 shares) if I can buy GME from you at $20 a share on or before January fifteenth” and then whoever sold them the option said “lmao bet, there’s no chance in hell thats happening”

Now that GME is above the theoretical break-even of $20.07 per share (the strike price plus the premium), OP is DEEP DEEP DEEP in the moneyNo.  He convinced someone (call him Bob), who probably was holding shares of GME, of the following deal, likely a few months ago.  

"Hey Bob, GME is $2 a share but I have a crazy hunch it's going to $30.   I will pay you $0.07 a share if you agree that I can buy your shares from you at $20 per share anytime I want, at my option, before January 15, 2021."

Bob thinks about it.  He is essentially selling any gains above $20 a share to OP for $0.07.  If he doesn't think there will be any such gains, he is getting $0.07 for "free".  So he takes the money from OP.he bought 1/15 20cs at around $.07/contractDamn wish I had offered that dude 8 :([deleted]Well yeah at this point you've gotten to know them. If you never had them you wouldn't know it.If you like cars, more than worthIf you pull earnings/gains out of a Roth IRA before age 59.5 those are subject to 10% early withdrawal penalty^ Roth’sChildSo if I make to much money to contribute to a Roth I open a regular IRA say with vanguard and then they can convert it to a Roth?

So essentially to do this every year you need to open new Ira, convert  then asset transfer (of you want one account)?

Who do you use?That’s not true is it? Any IRA has a limit of $6k regardless of how it’s funded. The back door part is to get around the a $130k income limit. Or so I thoughtLel although I believe in vaccinations and their benefits, doesn't mean I can't be a tard <3. We all out here just trying to make money.
TSLA 1500 1/15c all day bois.Sweet, thanks for your help!What I don't understand, is with puts and calls, the seller and buyer is under no obligation to actually buy or sell. So how did we see all those 100k+ loses last year from options? I was under the impression that the WSBer lost a ton of money because they had to fulfill the contract and they guessed the market wrong. But, I think I'm now realizing that they just spent way more than OP on options that basically were worthless in the end. 

Side note: it also seemed to me that they stood to gain way less than OP while simultaneously putting up more money with more risk. Maybe it's like gambling and the guy that put up $50k with 3:1 odds lost and the guy that put up $7k with 300:1 odds won.But $20.07 per share vs current price of $31.4 is only a 51% gain, not 14,572% as the chart says? And wouldn't it just make more sense for him to have bought GME back when it was $4 instead of paying a premium to have an option to buy at 21?$0.07/share 

$7/contractYup, just buy a smaller house.I use fidelity. I have two IRAs with them, one traditional and one Roth. At the beginning of the year I fund my traditional. Wait a few days for everything to clear then transfer it to my Roth.

That’s it. You do need to make sure you report it correctly on taxes so you don’t double pay taxes. Personally I’ve found turbo tax handles it really easily, but there are guides online on how to report it for others. Here’s the turbo tax one I’ve used in the past: https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-report-backdoor-roth-in-turbotax.html

Edit: also I just leave my traditional Ira open with them. It’s just empty most the year.Good luck!Per share, they’re making $10 and change. For that $10 and change, they only paid 7¢. And that, of course, is only if they exercise the options and sell immediately. Otherwise, they can sell some of the contracts so they can afford to exercise the rest (AKA buy the shares for $20) and then keep holding since they think it’s going to go even higherThey’re not shares, they’re contracts! Bundles of 100 shares.Those traditional to roth conversions are still capped at 6k correct? Meaning if I had 10k I want to throw in a traditional and convert, on top of the 6k I already funded straight into my Roth, would I face issues?gotcha thank you for the explanation.It’s a shared max. You can only put in 6k into any kind of Ira. A backdoor Roth just skirts the issue of maximum income limits for Roths. If you put in 6k into a Roth you don’t get to put more into a traditional and convert it.10-4 thanks.
