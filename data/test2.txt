KINGI got absolutely zero work done today at my job...  

I spent all day watching GameStop’s price action and waiting on the gain porn that /u/DeepFuckingValue was gonna drop on us at the end of the day.

You’ve done it again.  Your massive dick has somehow grown even larger.  You sir are a true WSB legend and will end up being #1 on the Hall of Fame.

Edit: And he’s still holding his contracts expiring this Friday!! Balls of steel and he’s that confident in GME continuing to 🚀🚀🚀.  I’ll continue to hold with you!YOU STILL DIDNT SELL THE 1/15s!!!!?????

Bro you are next level diamond hands holy fucking shit. From now on, we will refer to them as deepfuckingvalue handsNeed to make a movie out of this called The Big LongCasually makes 2.6M and doesn’t sell. This dude probably fucks his wifes momFucking made enough in one day to essentially retire if he wanted. What a god. His Diamond Hands flow through us.I was refreshing frantically during power hour for your update!  
  
I mean, you bought the Jan 15 calls months ago. Got ridiculed, derided and shat on.  
  
But to time it that perfectly, to be ITM just a couple of days before expiry, the odds of that happening are slim.  
  
Most of us retards can't predict the price action for tomorrow, you could see it from half a year away! Well fuckin done, damn!  
  
"You held!" and "You are still in!" must be the most common replies you might have got in the last 3 months. Balls of MT steel, sir!For me that would be fat fire. I‘d rip my pants off in our daily teams call tomorrow and never look back. Please fuck you. And congratulations.PALANTIR TO AQUIRE $3M CONTRACT FROM WSB TO TRACK DOWN GME SQUEEZE DENIERS 🚀🚀🚀Feeling cute. Might make 2.6 mm todayThe KING is back 🚀🚀🚀

Edit: KING 👑To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Melvin Capital. The analysis is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the price targets will go over a typical bull's head. There's also Nagel's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The Glizzies understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these shorts, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about $GME . People who long GME ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate the math in Curt's existential catchphrase "$1.60 PT," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Melvin's genius wit unfolds itself on their stock screeners. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

JK, you are a god amongst mortals... you’re going to exercise the 1/15 $20 aren’t you? You’re going to single handedly wipe Melvin off this plane of existence aren’t you?OMG you still had the 1/15sPetition to make this guy a mod 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀## You know this shits going on Wall Street Journal or some shit tomorrow right?🚀 I FUCKING LOVE YOU 🚀 I AINT FUCKING SELLING 🚀2.6 mil in a day, fuck my wife I begWill you fuck my wife please?Who is u/DeepFuckingValue? 🙄🤭🤔🤫😰

Just wait until the shorts squeeze. This man’s about to be worth an easy 8 figures.GME isn’t over yet fools#THIS MAN IS A FUCKING GODAll hail.

I would let you peg me.I’m fully convinced this wasn’t even the squeeze. There are still many catalysts. Especially if any more form 13D, or 3 & 4. Show more insider buying it’s gonna be insane. I should thank you, I noticed you held after that brutal earnings and that really convinced me to buy. Holding shares and April $17 calls. Gonna keep holding. You’ve earned this and happy you shared with others.This may as well be the GME megathreadDude. It's not even over. I've been along for the ride since $16.50 I'm not selling.

Good for you man you deserve it ✊This is what I was waiting for...of all the massive gains I’ve seen on this sub it feels like yours are the least based on luck. You did all your diligence, took what was a very contrarian position at the time against all advice because you believed in the thesis you arrived at in your research. Put your balls on the table and your money where your mouth was. And everything you said was right. God damn the conviction must feel almost as good as the money.

I’d sell now and I'd never work. I'd just stay home all day, watch Scarface 50 times, eat a turkey sandwich, and have sex all fucking day. Then I'd dress up like a clown, and surprise kids at schools. Then I'd take a dump in the back of a movie theater, and just wait until somebody sat in it. Hear it squish. That's funny to me. Then I'd paint, and read, and play violin. I'd climb the mountains, and sing the songs that I like to sing.[/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) Thanks so much for everything you sacrifice! You could  just be a guy in a room making money quietly on his own, but you put in the work to share the wealth.

So this guy has mad a fuck tonne on GameStop stock increasing from 0.40 to its current value at 31.40.

Are the calls on the left his safety nets? 
If so why hasn't he increased them to something more inline with its current value?

Clearly Reddit Karma is worth more than Cash If this is real on GameStop.This man is too busy fucking my wife to reply to any of these comments. I'll let you guys know when he's done.

And Because i bought 40 shares yesterday Thanks to this DFV genius among autistsLooking back at the original post a year ago the comments are hilarious. Something about landing a jetliner in between the bid ask spread and how OP wouldn’t be able to close the positions.DFV hands!!!!!!!!!!! legendary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Is it too late to get in on this gme action with calls?53k to 6MYou are my idol. If DFV is still in, I'm still in.Congratulations and fuck you.Fucking congrats man. YOLO inspirationCan I get a small loan of 1 million?Is this like real money ? I never even saw 5k in real life 😂😭Daddyyeahhh if you could just give me the next GME that'll be super..

congratulations too btw, i would have never expected gamestop to bounce back this wellJust wanted to say I was here for this. What a legendCan someone clarify me something about options? So he has those calls, if he does exercise the call he can buy 100 shares per contract for the option price, right? So when he exercise that he won't sell the calls since he is the owner, so he won't get those millions? I thought you gained money in options by selling your contracts, if he keeps them he can buy at 20$ and sell at 30$? I know I'm wrong just don't really understand whereThis is the last fuckin time I dont follow u damn autists on a meme stock! Nice gains fam 🤣🤘helllooooooo capital gains!IMO many of us will never earn 1% of this play in many years2.7m in one day.

Edit: 🚀🚀🚀The massive fucking balls on DFV... Wow. I hate this stupid company and ultimately think they will fail, but it doesn't matter because you'll still be set for life. I'm kicking myself for not buying in when they were $3 a share because it would've been a great hedge to my hope that they'd finally go bankrupt. Every experience I've had with this store has been terrible and I have no clue how they're still around. I guess their brand is really that valuable?Bought in today for the first time.....this is the wayYou won.Not gonna lie, I woke up thinking about those 1/15s this morning. $1M single day gain 2 days before expiration. Yo.What if DFV was actually Ryan Cohen?LMFAO my boomer dad really worked his whole life for that and this guy made it in 1 year. When’s fucking legendThis guy fucksCan someone explain to me how the fuck this happened? If we can just balloon a stock like that, why not just do it every week and make a shit ton off options and shit. I know next to nothing about the market except “sell for higher than you bought”.40k would change my life but this mf yolo'ing hundreds of thousands lmao holy shitHey, you dropped this 👑The Supreme ruler.Bro you made me a ridiculous amount of money and I thank you for sharing with us. I was a sold back in October, and GME delivered hard today.Ya but like, who even really NEEDS money, anywaysAt this point, just pull out, invest in a low risk 8% gain and live off the 400,000 a year in capital gainsWSB LEGEND. My kids will remember your name.Why didn’t I follow him Monday?I dont understand anything on screen but those are some big numbers

Good work47k into options and you fucking did it. One of them expires in 2 days and it mooned.

Also clicked through to Zer033x’s profile, the person who's telling him he's an idiot. Zero's last comment is from 9 months ago, when he said: “I only do short plays lately.” He has not had any activity on Reddit since then, and, well…we all know how short plays probably did from April/May to now.

So, uh... RIP Zer033xomg omg the King wins so hard I wish my name was ValueFUCK YOUI just had the single best trading day ever thanks to your plays and 💎🙌 encouraging me to hold and add on dips.

What i understand: he has the right to buy 1000 shares at 11.40$ (11400$?) but the market price is 31$ (31400$?) so where all the million comes from?

&#x200B;

Also: in case that the call reaches the date limit, he has to put money to buy the stocks? (what happens if he doesnt have the money?)Quit giving him Reddit awards. King Retard already has enough treasuresAbsolute mental. CongratsCongratulations my dude!Hi from frontpage.

I don't really understand what has happened here, can someone please let me know where I've gone wrong?

* First row: op bought 50k shares at 14.89 each, today's price is $31.40, so OP has made $825k profit (worth)
* Second row: OP, at some point in the past, bought 1000 shares at 0.0726 each (???).
* These shares, he will sell at $20/share, regardless, on Jan 15 2021 (???)
* Today, the shares are worth $31.40 each? But what does 11.40 last price indicate for the second row? Where does the million dollars come from (??)
* Third row: (???)

Hey, you (almost) doubled your money. Nobody ever went broke doing that.

Burry is going to pull a wet fart out of his hat. I appreciate the fact that he's trying to be an activist investor by goading the GME board into buying back stock, but I don't think that's going to work for this rodeo.

Well, at this point, you could sell half your options and break even, leaving the other half to experience whatever sorts of gains you imagine they might. It's like these options have paid you to play the lottery.

I’ll lend you the other half for half the price of your margin :)Can I have 2000 dollarsI understand calls a bit but can anyone explain the call scenario here and why the gains were so huge ?what does $20 call mean? also, how did you pay .0726? I do not see that anywhere in the history.Okay so I'm just a regular autist. I'm not a full blown weaponized autistic like the rest of you. Can anyone explain to me how these calls work?Is the short squeeze over? How will we know when it’s close to over. Pls help.Does OP make more money if he just let the Jan 15 option expire?

He's deep ITM anyways if it expires tomorrow. There's no way GME drops below $20.Got here from r/all...someone please tell me what the heck I'm looking at so I can appreciate it more.coming from r/all, can anone explain this in layman terms?ok i wandered in from /all, can someone tell me wtf happened here? seems like he paid a tiny amount for gamestop stocks that then skyrocketed for some reason? 

why did he think gamestop would rise? what is up with january 15? idk shit about investing and am very new to it so genuinely interested in what this guy didSeen this on Reddit Popular post feed... Im intrigued but some please explain what does this all mean!?!?Hi, I'm from r/all

Where did this money come from? Did someone or a company lose it to him like a bet?[deleted]What the hell is happeningThis subreddit is unkempt. Jesus fuck.Praise him 🙏🏻🙏🏻 he is our messiah 🙌🏻🙌🏻 GME 🚀🚀🚀 we shall follow him till we are all rich or die trying 🤚🏻💎🤚🏻💎I'm kinda a huge retard on this guys, please don't kill me, but am I reading this correctly?  His majesty paid .07 cents a share for the option, so he paid $7,000 a long time ago, and he's got until Friday to sell his position or exercise his option, but if he had done that at the time this screenshot was taken, he'd have essentially turned $7000 into over 1.1 million USD?!!!!What made you spend 800k on GameStop to begin with? Genuinely curious what you saw that you were so confident in cAuse you nailed itFor all you guys who made a killing today, I am on the board of a non profit and we have been supplying food and PPE for elderly and poor NYC residents.     If you want to make a donation and pay it forward, message me and I can provide you details!Imagine GME going 35% down tomorrow.I ... I just can't. Gamestop is a store, that's it. I really hope you have a 7 figure net worth bro.The fact that he went long on GME and only gained 110% return on his position, is really dragging down his overall performance.What the fuck is wrong with youIf you didn’t sell you’re an idiotCan someone explain to me what I’m seeing hereWait guys how do we know this isn’t inspect element?As someone who wants to start gambling like a professional, where the fuck do I learn how to do this?

I don't even know how to read this graph, other than to recognize Numbers Green, Numbers Big.Awwww those poor expiring calls. Why don’t you just be a big boy and move em over to next week.Who the fuck has 6M laying around to YOLO?I dont get it, how could anyone know that GME that has done jack shit since 2010 but tank would pop up in one day gains it hasnt seen in a decade. I DONT UNDERSTAND. now some tool is gonna come in here and say "It wAs ObViOUs..." but they put no gains.Noob here. Is this a good stock to jump into? Figured I'd invest my stimulus in something, see if I can make enough for a small peice of land.So how did he make money? Im not sure what I am looking at...So he yolo 800k? What % of portfolio was that?
Must have had inside info of board shakeup?So why did it go up 50% today, it’s fucking game stop lolWait... This was valued at $3m a few weeks ago? GME goes up 70% and you make only 800k more?This may be the dumbest question here. But can someone explain how the hell he made such profit on his two calls? I get the buy and hold on his $14 purchase. But I'm a bit dumfounded on how the profit came from the other two positions of Jan and April?I'm kinda new to options. What is the benefit to holding the contracts after they've hit the strike price?So to be sure, did OP really makr $5.7 Million in a single day from the most risky bet in Wall Street[deleted]Seriously, how the fuck is GME worth anything?I'm new to this sub and don't get what I'm seeing here, I can see he made 2.7m profit but how should I interpret the rest?Confused as to what’s going on? Just found this on my explore, can someone please explain?:DHello I am from all, what is this?Are you smoking fucking crack? You dropped $800,000 into one play? What percentage of your net worth was that at the time.... Obviously you cost averaged into the position but how much of your networth were you willing to risk? You definitely know what the fuck your doing Jesse Livermore. 

   Wait no nvm... Does this guy only yolo fucking GameStop🤨... What the fuck is this? How? This defies logic, it doesn’t make sense.... Of all 6,000 publicly traded companies between the NYSE and NASDAQ, fucking GameStop.... Your posts are baffling... WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? FUCKING GAMESTOP FUCKING GAMESTOP... WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCKING SHIT IS THIS... FUCKING GAMESTOP... $5,700,000 ON FUCKING GAMESTOP TELL ME YOU DIDN’T RISK ALL YOUR LIQUID NET WORTH AND BECOME A MULTIMILLIONAIRE OFF FUCKING GAME STOP... WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT...

   You couldn’t have possibly risked your whole liquid net worth, not even 20%, not even 2-5% on fucking GameStop.... You work for or have worked for a hedge fund or in PE.... No one could have seen that... There’s no way in hell a retail trader could have this level of risk tolerance.... Without possessing a high level of understanding in financial markets and a strong financial backing.... With high liquidity... Unless you’re the ultimate autist.... 

   If so how the actual fuck do you have this level of risk tolerance? Survivorship bias is why you’re a god in this sub.... Your success realistically propagates and stimulates at least a mild sense of delusional grandeur for financial success, & of course a hyper stimulation for gamblers fallacy among 1.7million people.... You do understand this..... This is why you’re a deity in WSB.... Gamblers fallacy can be very powerful....  Ego validation is why you’ve demonstrated your wins feels fucking good... I’m fully aware that you know the level of delusion and fallacy in this sub the majority of all their brokerage accounts cannot do not make money consistently.... That’s why you experience so much praise... Tell me not...?Please explain why are u still holding and not at least cashing ur position expiring this weeklol that's great and all but this price action still makes no since. omg e-commerce tripled... from like shit to shitx3 still shit.

Now, I know how TSLA people feel on days it's rocketing.I have 600 shares and all I did was stare at GME stock.I almost crashed my carSame thing here. I was fairly productive in the first half of the day but when i randomly checked my portfolio and saw the 80 % gamestop gain i couldnt go back to work i had to look up more DD posts and find out if any shorts had covered.same lol I was just cryingYep saw it skyrocket this morning and didn’t even go to work.I don't even have any skin in the game but I couldn't stop watching GME and WSB for most of todayI have done fuck all of studying today. Been eyeing the GME chart ALLLLLLLL DAAYYYYSame. Today was awesome.you and everybody else on that first line of your comment lmaoooThis fact (he's holding) makes me want to open my first ever call position but I have no clue what I'm doing lolDays like this are comparable to me to going to the casino with your buds and playing craps together. Most of the time, we either all make money or all of us lose some money. 

Either way, win or lose, doing together is a hell of a time and feels like money well spent.He's been holding for year plus...whats a few more days? Exercise the contracts....continue to hold the shares....when it hits $100 you have $10mm just on those alone, not including his other positions. Jesus fucking christ....Name checks outI’m not a fan of working anyway. Glad I could spend the day watching DFV making himself a legendam a teacher. was really hard to teach today lolHe's been holding those contracts for a year now. He got so lucky with the Jan 15th dateBro same lol I nearly faked sick. Going up that much in one morning just makes my reality relatable lolCan someone link me to some context? Why did he buy GameStop a year ago?I’m in Asia and I made this mistake of peaking a look at my phone after it started to rocket and now I’m tired as fuck cause is stayed up all night looking at it.  

I asked my girl if I should sell and she at 75.. if

We ain’t selling!DFV Hands is when the diamond hands are so diamond that calling them diamond no longer equates to the diamondness of the hands.I hope that becomes a phraseRoll those fuckers in to more. Singlehandedly drive the market with the MMs having to hedge against the new contracts, lol.I cashed out my 1/15's this morning at 10:15, at the very beginning of the run. I got out at a profit, but if I had held it literally would have been 10x the profit.

I keep telling myself - "at least they didn't expire worthless!"

F'ing paper hands... at least I still have shares & Apr calls so it was still a good day for me! Just coulda been better!Convincing myself that THOSE 1000 MOTHERFUCKING CALLS expiring in 2 days and many other autists here who followed OP over period of last 6-8 months started this marvelous launch to moon today.He probably just forgot. Nobody is this ballsy.. right?They’re so deep ITM that theta doesn’t even matter now. Unless there’s a drop before Friday might as well hold before expiration. Those can still run.Probably planning to exercise since their ITM. He is the definition of long investor not traderNoob question: what happens to them on the 15th when they expire? Do they get automatically exercised?Let's get this man on the board of directorsHe must have fucking known ever sinceI will use that term from now onLooks like screenshot was taken around 10:15am EST. Maybe he sold at the peak?I’m actually sad to see this.  I sold my 1/15s today because I didn’t know what to do.  Held my shares though.I hope he exercises them.Or Yolo SwagginsYeah Holy Shit.  I sold my 1/15s mid day when it hit $29.  I still have lots of shares and April $35 calls, but those 1/15s had to go, fam.  Not paper hands, but def not diamond.  Maybe iron?DFV hands cut diamonds like hot butter, that's how fucking next level they areHe’ll probably exercise them Wurtzite Boron Nitride hands welded onto this bit. Fuck your shit.

I am assuming he repositionedI mean he put in almost 800k...clearly he's already loaded to be doing that anyways.He’s already a rich person.

Or is a call buying a stock? I want to be an autist like everyone else. I just withdrew all my money from my live savings (5k), and am ready.GangsterEvery advice I get from people is “SELL!” These pussies don’t know anything about money, they just get in, see a profit, sell, or lose money and panic sell. They’re literally retarded, and if you know or are confident that something is going to moon, you don’t need to worry about dips here and there. One of these people sold 80k of Apple after a dip like 10-20 or more years ago (idk when it was trading). He would’ve been a multi millionaire by now if he held I think. That person is my dad and that person also has only given me shit investing advice lol. 📄 handsI'm new to this sub. What is happening with this dude?He’ll double it by next week 🚀🚀🚀🚀 short interest has barely moved and short squeeze just began4 mil prolly after tax, 160k @4% SWR is definitely a fat fire. We all long the dayI would do the same, 5M is right about the figure that i have set for retirement.

Obviously i know nothing and thus i will stay in until DFV exits.

Gotta thank the guy for the tendies, entered late with shares (around 14), but still 10% gain of my whole portfolio in just one day is madness.People need to stop talking about retirement around here,  we do what we do for the love of the sport, there is no retiring, we keep going til the wheels fall offYou wear pants to a teams call?...Lmao dude I feel that so much... I had a 1/8 23c which expired worthless :( i missed getting out of the rat race by a week :((((Seriously. $5M is enough. Just cash out OP... you're good to retire.IMO, it's definitely the time to cash out all of that. Maybe keep a little bit still on the line (like 20% at most), just in case it goes up more, so that you don't have FOMO or too many regrets if it somehow goes up again. There's something far worse than missing out on a bigger profit: having a big profit in your hands, and letting it fall through.

Take the money and run. But keep the dayjob (or job hunt for a more enjoyable dayjob), at least for a year or two. If you quit your dayjob, you'll find that you spend the money all day long, and it goes away very quickly. The dayjob helps prevent impulse purchases.I would just pump that shit into some high yield dividend ETFs and call it a day for life. Capital will appreciate further and divvies will take care of fat fire.🤣 🚀 🚀 🚀😂😂😂Let’s gooooooo!Seems like they just week awaiting all these contracts, they are really starting to add up!2.7*2.6 millimeters?You jack to this trade yet?The Diamond Handed GodSame brother.

He is our godI'm interested tooMe too. Fun ride.I’ve wondered that about this dude too.  I’d worry about getting hit by a banana truck and ending up in a coma while they expire or some shit.  I hope he’s had a talk with his wife about how to get into his account and sell them.  Of course she’s probably super smart and nice with a giant set of milkers.Dude is diamond hands for sure but to be fair they were "only" worth 100k yesterday, the calls were ATM so it didn't look too bad anyway. He has already made millions from his originial 100k investment, 1.1M in realized cash. $100k is play money for this guyYeah but they were $7 per contract when he bought them. Whats $7000 of contracts worth when you are already up $3million on the play lolThere’s no hedge here, this is just a full bull play. Look up call options.

As for the meteoric rise in value, look for any of the GME threads in this sub or VW in 2008.Those are lotto tickets made out of his diamond testiclesThe calls on the left are where all the money came from. You can see what he paid for them and what they are worth.Some hedge funds assumed GameStop (GME) would go bankrupt, or at least remain valued in the single digits.
GME did not, in fact, go bankrupt. They even got a very prominent activist investor’s interest, and he is positioning to takeover the company.
OP saw that a lot of people had overextended themselves in assuming GME bankruptcy, and GME could spike in value if anything pushed the price up. This is because they have to cover their positions (short sells and puts,) and the amount of shares available is finite & depleted (because of their reckless abandon in shorting.) 

OP put his thesis to the ultimate test and threw his money at GME call options (at the dates and costs listed above.) 

He was correct. 

TL;DR: people expected bankruptcy, bet on it, lost the bet, and now they have to pay up by buying shares. This causes share value to skyrocket. 

Just google “GME short squeeze Reddit”

Edit: former 3rd key at GameStop, a long time ago. Solidarity.Buy GME get rich 🚀🚀🚀This is the way.Lmao, wheels.You might not belong here. 😉It's unbelievable!time traveler. or sometimes the starts just align right to form a massive bull cock and balls.GodamnitLiterally 9 days after BL droppedDer SenseiMinimum $250k per dollar move, I’d say at least $7.5mil at today’s highThe timing is uncannyI almost doubt the retards running GameStop would have even predicted this.  Their boomer CEO was probably planning to pilot the company straight while pillaging everything that isn’t bolted down like the guy from Sears did a few years ago.📈it’s the best game in the worldwould take two seconds of reading the sub to figure it out dingusIf I’m reading it correctly it was $7000->$1.1M.

$7 per contract. 1000 contracts were bought.  Still ridiculous nonetheless.Yes, just buy the stock. Almost too lateIn a gd yr. fuck. On gme. WowGME is the next GME. This is just the beginning. 100 share easyInterested to know this alsoHe will buy the shares for cheap (the strike price) and sell them on the market for the current much higher price immediately thereafter.  I'm not exactly sure the logistics of this, but that's the gist of it.  The option price is subtracted from his profits so at the end of all transactions he'll have paid the strike price + the option price for each share then sold them at current market value.  Option price is also know as premium.  You pay a premium for the right to buy shares at the strike price and if the price goes down you will lose 100% of that premium unless you sell the options but they'll lose value quickly if the trade goes the other way.If he executes the calls he will get 100 shares *per contract* at the strike price (he has $12 and $20 strikes, 1000 contracts of each). He can then do whatever he wants with those shares. The contracts combined are 200,000 shares at an average cost of $16 per share.

He would need $3.2 million cash to execute all those contracts. If he does not have the cash the contracts will be automatically sold on their expiration date, likely to a large institution who will profit virtually risk free on the tiny spread between the option price and the stock price. That also means he loses that little sliver of profit by not executing the contracts himself.He's coming up on a almost a year holding a lot of that GME.He started with almost $800k, most of us will never have even a quarter of that in liquid assets.Of course they're gonna fail, it's a brick and mortar multimedia company in a world where you can get fresh tomatoes delivered to your doorstep without getting off the toilet.

But for investors, especially options people; what a fucking opportunity!!

And I fucking played goev and ktos.  RIP my portfolio.Seriously?!  The FIRST day you bought into the gme hype was THE day?  That's bonkers, but congrats.It’s the beginning stages of a short squeeze. Look at VW in 2008.Outta here with this boomer shit. MARS NEXT 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀What is low risk and 8%?  AT&T type play?I knew I should haveYou could've been a millionaire if you put $2500 into 1/15 35C. They were as low as $2 an option today and at peak, they went for $800 a pop.Cramer should call him.Like a 🌈🐻Yes it will. Despite all the hype today wasn’t even **THE** squeeze. It certainly was SOME short positions covering, but most likely some insider buying mixed with those covers and then the day traders swinging options and yeah, you saw what happened.


This will definitely climb more. Buy shares. Apr calls.You think he held all this time for this? Watch and learn.Agree, this guy and some other dude a couple of months ago that also DD'd GME going up during a new console cycle (well before the wsb hype) deserve their gains 100%it's probably a mod.His 1st post via his usernamei shall contributedo not question the KING!This is the only yolo. Never sellTHIS is the yolo, bro. The yolo ain't overHe made around 5 million on gamestop. He is the messiahHis very first post shows a cost basis of approx. $53,700, I think he didn’t add anything else in.FProbably one eye burry.... Or he is one eye 🤷‍♂️Thanks for the flash back.  DFV is so confident, and correct!2019. The mad man has been waiting for this all this timeHe never comments, it’s part of his coolnessHe made 2.7milNo you math wrong, $7,260 is now a mil.dude it is 7206$He has had multiple calls for 1/15. The $20s have always been 0.0726.ppl been saying that to him since christmasOr is this Michael Burry's alt account and wsb was a critical piece to the overall strategy? Inspiring this sub to diamond hand GME, knowing years ago that he'd eventually need all of us to united to take down the professional 🌈🐻s in order to get his position over the finish line. From the outset he never talked shit to those who doubted, took us through the ups and downs while never wavering in conviction like only someone with neutron stars for balls can do, then we finally knew who to follow with similar conviction to fuck the shorts and never sell. A calculated move to embolden the shorts to make the mistake of thinking 1.8m internet strangers couldn't act as one and change the course of stock market history and finally let him finish his trade while giving us tendies along the way. Yes, u/DeepFuckingValue is Michael Burry, but is this really just about a trade to make money? Yes it is, but also about showing the power of a group of autists with stimulus checks and diamond hands, and maybe also friendship or why Jim Cramer can never wield such power.

To have diamond hands is to inspire diamond hands50k into 5 million. he’s been in gme for over a yearHe turned about 50k into about 5.5 millionWhy?We going up!Because he's diamond handed it for >1 yr to get hereBasically 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀100k ishHe made $2.7M in one dayHe bought into GME last year when everyone thought it was going bankrupt.Other way. He’s got the right to buy 100 shares per contract at the strike price.Run, and never return. It’s for your own good. 

“Get out of here, Dewey. You don't want no part of this shit.”2.7m for the dayHe paid a lot less than thatOg bet a year ago was 53k ishStarted with 50k over a year ago I believe based off his post historyA fucking legend at work. Just spinning goldThe kind is making BANK off GameStop stockThis man believed in GameStop when no one else didGo away, GDI.ITM. They're his *if* he wants to buy at the strikeHe’ll probably exercise them meaning but them at the call price. He could sell them at face value too but only if you do absolutely nothing will they expire worthless. And on RH they would automatically sell them idk about other brokerages cause I’m poor.?He wouldn't owe anything but he is currently risking $700,000 of capital and $4.3M of paper gains, could lose everything if stock sinks to 0 but it won't happen.In standard call/put option buying (not selling, buying,) loss is capped at the premium of the option. Basically, you can only lose what you paid for the option. 

However, that is only the case when buying a call or a put. Selling can lead to owing money, which is exactly what is happening to the funds that bet against GME.🚀🚀🚀🚀Easy. Download Robinhood. Transfer all money into account. Buy GME shares. 🚀🚀🚀🚀Derivatives. Look into options if you want to learn more.Almost a year ago.How can you tell when he sold?  Did you just do the math?Look at his profile retardhe wasn’t buying shares, he was buying options contracts - This allowed him to have a more leveraged position and thus why he had much higher percent gainsUhh, cause options...?He bought 1000 contracts.40k initial investment, moved options gains to purchase the underlying security in this case GME.Stonks go up.This is the memo. Train hasn't left the station yet don't get left behind.DFV is a good looking young man. Only common with Cramer: man (without wanting to assume for either of them). 
   
He’s Roaring Kitty on YouTube, check him out.Thats the option price retardHe started with about 80k in GME options a year ago and now has over 5 million dollarsHe's just a normal guy. Streaming right now on YouTube. Roaring kitty.2.7 in one dayI have 100 shares at $10 each. You think the price will go over $20 by April. I don't think it will go that high, so I sell you a bet (a covered call) that pays me $100 per contract (100 shares) and in exchange agree to sell you the shares at $20, even if the price goes higher than that. If it doesn't get to $20 I keep my shares and profit the $100 premium.You have to go way back to the early posts , but he started with 40-50k and ended up with 5.7 millionThe first row is just shares, $14.89 is the average price he paid per share, of which he has 50,000That’s not 1000 shares, that’s 2000 contracts and each contract is worth 100 shares.Go back to options 101. 

But yes if he decides to exercise his calls ( which he’s prolly going to) he will have to put up a certain amount. Then he’ll own those thousands of shares at a HUGE discount.OP actually bought calls on the second and third row.You’ll have to look up call options on YouTube for the second and third row. 

He started with less shares much cheaper at the start, but kept adding shares as he exercised call options along the wayHe made bets a long time ago that the stock would be where it is today. like when it was around 5 dollars a share he bet over a year into the future it would be 20 dollars. The further out you bet the cheaper the per stock price is. Bet long time ago + very right about it = rich dude.You think people are apart of this sub to live frugally ?Hes had the calls for monthsNo that one cost 7usd per contract and he has 1000 of them so 100×1000=100000 shares“I AINT FUCKING SELLING!”

DFV, Probably.The rich get richer my friendYou doubt GME will go above 35. You must be stupid. It’ll be 40 end of month easilyGoogle is hardHoly shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.

Probably just a coincidence.Read his 1st post. Read the comments and the date. You’ll understand.A year and a half ago, he bet that GameStop’s stock price would rise almost tenfold by now. It’s done even better. Many consider the company the next Blockbuster, but his research shows otherwise. The tens of thousands of dollars he invested is now worth millions. He’s my daddy and has balls of steel!!He bought calls, which are options, on gamestop. You buy calls when you think the stock will go up. They can increase wayy more and way faster than just buying shares.

Simply put gamestop rocketed and his calls increased in price an immense amount.Not sure about his reasons specifically but the general idea is that GameStop is changing its business model as a whole and people are betting that they'll be successful in future despite its recent state of decline.
An analyst who predicted the 2008 crash and profited massively off of it also made the realisation that since the PS5 is coming with an inbuilt disc reader, physical copies of games aren't going to be phased out any time in the near future, hence ensuring GameStop's survivability for at least a few more years. Since then, GameStop has been slowly rallying upwards.
Nothing specifically happened on jan15 that caused the spike in price, but rather it was a product of a culmination of events.

There are a few investment firms betting a significant amount that GameStop will go bankrupt, and are looking to profit off its crash. Profiting off a downward movement in a stock is known as "shorting". Shorting works by borrowing a stock with a promise to return it at a later date. You sell the borrowed stock while its price is high, then buy it again when its price drops. When time comes for you to return the stock to its original owner, you still return them the same amount of stock, which you got at a lower price, hence profiting. 

However, if the price of the stock keeps going up, the shorter will lose money, and at a certain point the shorters will be forced to cover their losses and buy the stock at a higher price. When they buy more stock it causes the price to go up even further, leading to more losses for other shorts, creating a sort of feedback loop of shorters trying to cover their losses and pushing the price further and further up. This is what's known as a "short squeeze"  and is what's happening with GME. It just so happens that on Jan14 the shorts likely decided that it's time to cover some of their losses.

There's further suspicion that the GME shorts aernt playing fair for reasons too technical for me to explain, and users of this sub have submitted complaints to the SEC. But the main gist of it is that there's a possibility of the price of GME going way higher when shit hits the fan for the big short players.
If you would like further reading on this phenomenon you can look up the short squeeze of Volkswagen when it briefly became the most valuable company in the world in 2008.Yes a tiny amount (relatively to his gains).  
He explains why on his YouTube channel.Bought up GameStop shares and calls at the bottom, they went up since then, with 60/70% increase today alone.This is literally what people have been telling him for a year. If he ever listened to wsb, he wouldn't be where he is today.

He could realistically hit 10-20 million in the next several weeks.Yes, that is how options work.

No, you will never be able to do it.

Yes, you should still try.The old and poor get the rope,  not the tendies.Happy cake daydoes the april part mean he can't sell till april?Started with a 50K investment.  The jump in basis is from sale of options to buy 40K more
shares recently.A guy that bought options back in 2019 for a seemingly dying "blockbuster of gaming" type of company and everyone ridiculed him for it back then.

I believe he started with around 140k and is now sitting at 5.8m, with more room to grow. He is the gamecock, the share soared by 60% making him about 2.5mil just today.You just feel it in the base of your nutsackLook at his post history. He’s been doing updates back when he first put in 50k and everyone clowned him for ‘making a bad play’Huh?

Are you actually on the spectrum or are you fair game?He started with $50k.You might want to research the King while inside the castle, jsDawg he bought all that wellllllllll before it was worth 6mit's been talked about for around 4-6 months. Ryan Cohen one of the cofounders of Chewy.com bought a very sizeable amount of shares. There were also a shit ton of shorts. it turned into a perfect storm you could say. and after yesterdays news of Cohen and some Chewy members joining the board with Cohen it took off today right after Jim Cramer tweeted about it. at this point it's launched so high that the shorts have to cover their positions which causes it to pump more, there's still many shares left that are short so it will probably continue. but who knows now that it's known across the internet.  

This is all news that is very obtainable and not "it was obvious" it was always a gamble, but a very good gamble. what you said is the same thing everyone said when Disney first announced Disney+ , many knew there was a high possibility they would disclose the new service during investor day, yet tons of redditors couldn't believe people were making 10 baggers without being insider info. they just don't follow the news and rumors. it's that simple, but people rather believe it's something nefarious.You know hilariously I don’t know why this isn’t obvious but just look at new console release which is usually a once in decade event. Maybe not decade but 6-10 years. Every bump is correlated with the new PlayStation. Such a shocker isn’t it

You could have seen this 2 years early. Michael Burry letter last year should’ve convinced youit's worth 5.7 million you donkeyHe bought those calls a while back when they were .07 and .40 cents per contract. Those same calls have multiplied in value like crazy (see what he paid for and how much it’s going for now per contract).Anyone?Run away retardban this doodHe had $40k in march, doesn't even own his house (him and his partner rent), people here were saying he'd lose it all in GMEWhere have you been broWelcome to the retarded sideYou see something like this, you bow like a mere mortal.... this is the way.All you need to know is you ain’t that guy, and you ain’t never gonna be that guyDo you see the column that says "day gain"?

That's how much money he made TODAY.Holy shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.

GameStop is a stonk

Therefore GameStop goes upThis man’s investment went up $2 million today and you sat there and typed that gay bear shit?Yes>They haven't made money in years

literally did almost $2B you mongactually he only spent $7k for one of the plays that turned into $1M+Started with 50k onlyKing of the retardsThis deserves to be the most awarded postI think he deserves a Kramer section at this pointWhy the fuck do you threaten him like that, did he hurt you?I'd take 5 milly over being a mod any daynot gay enoughPlease. DFV/Roaring Kitty makes money.

Mods bans tickers until they are up 1,000% *then* WSB can talk about it openly and FOMO in after.nah, his girlfriend's husband deserves to be a mod thoNah, to be a mod you gotta be gay> makes a million dollars

“I think I’ll be a subreddit mod with all these newfound riches”Can just buy WSB at this point and make himself a mod10 bag millionaires don’t have time to mod.He deserves a board seat at this pointI agreeI thought he was.Did you just say he's gay?WSBgod materialKING is live streaming right now! 

https://youtu.be/_UhhgpNFKPQThought mods buy puts..???Hes too busy actually making money to be a mod here.Is he 🌈 enough?Shit. Reddit admin.Why the fuck would he want to be a modYeah, and Obama is going to manage a Wendys.ModtardI hope he names his yacht "tHe nExt bLoCkbUstEr"I agree with this article. I don’t think today was a “major” short squeeze. An important sign of a “major” short squeeze is that the stock becomes “easy to borrow”, GME is still hard to borrow which means most short sellers didn’t give up today...So you're saying we should all double down?This may be the case and mean the trade is still alive but i watched gme on its way up 90% and i have never seen that type of buying conviction before... especially if it was someone going long.  

That said, if it was not complete short covering, what is the short interest now?  

Is the official retard view to buy the dip for actual 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🛸?Buy in again at 32 you think??? I cashed out at 36I still don't understand what a short squeeze is.Thats if everyone holds!!I'm sure Melvin has read that MarketWatch article, and are probably crapping  themselves right now.Why do I see a bunch of new call options on RH that are blank for 1/15? Will those be available tomorrow at open?ALL HAIL THE REAL WSBGODAbsolutely NOTHING was done at work today waiting for this post. Could NOT WAIT for this post. 5.7 mill, from what, 70k??Tesla didnt rocket like this. Steady gains over months is not quite as crack like as 60 percent in one fucking day.

I bought more GME today, lolNot even tesla rose 60 percent in one day lolI don't have a lot to put into a portfolio, about 2k, but I had 12 shares of GME and that little bump in my portfolio made me happy. I don't have the best understanding of options, did options trading do even better than the stocks?High AFThis is like once every few years thing.Is it silly to buy shares now? Is there still an expectation that GME will continue to grow? I can maybe buy 10... lolWhen it hit 10% up on the day I said to myself wow that's a great day. Then it hit 20% up and I said holy shit. Then it hit 30% up and I said oh my God is the squeeze happening. Then it hit 40%. Then 50. Then 60. Then 70. Then 80 fucking percent up. Now it didn't finish 80% up but holy fuck. But that does mean that like you I was just staring at the screen for a good portion of the dayDamn. $8K in a day is something to be proud of. Hope you get more.If you do, please buy a Tesla.Crash it, then use the insurance money to buy more GMEI saw green pre-market and told my boss to fuck offRight, fuck that 9 to 5Last night I made comments on Webull "look at the bollinger bands and bull flag. This baby is gonna pop tomorrow"... I quit options but was gonna buy GME calls today. I saw it was up 5% pre market and was like " ahh too late it'll dip..." 

Here I am feeling retarded. I wish I would've looked yesterday but I took a mental health break from tradingNo shit, this is my favorite sport for sureSame, next exam in a few days, fuck mesame, entrance exam tomorrow - up 12k, has to be a good sign for tomorrowuh, this year retard.Dfv hands for shortThere needs to be DFV award we can give instead of diamond for the most autistic plays of all time.

Also, all the proceeds should be donated to autism’s in need; not the ones on wsb.It's more like diamondillium now.yesWhat does DFV stand for?Just didHe’s gonna exercise the calls. He has just enough cash + margin to exercise the call.But it doesn't make sense not to sell then buy the shares. You keep the extrinsic value.No one here knowsYesOr he’s going to hold for the jump tomorrow ?Almost 2 years ago, such a visionaryBro there is over a million in the 1/15s or 20% of his total portfolio😂😂🚀🚀💎🙏Deep Learning? DEEP VALUE!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I’d back the Pope allowing this man to bang everything under the sunbig schlonga longa dingdong12 inches and growing.SqueeeeeeeeezeAnd have Micheal Burry be the god-king that inspired itThe big deep fuckingStill unreal to me that batman played michael burryHe can be my daddy if he wantsthis guy eats ashe and fire. true legendI think most of our excuse is we don't have 700k to gamble like that.The only thing he needs to worry about now is what color lambo he wantsDon’t forget the IRS waiting to spread his cheeks straight after sellingI was talking purely on today's gains, not the total. So 80K a year, which I believe you could retire on, but not necessarily comfortably depending on inflation.Them taxes gong to eat the shit out of that windfall. Still enough to retire though.or if he yolos everything into $agnc he can live off a few thousand a day> On a 3% withdraw (so never run out of money)

We don't live in a world with Treasury Bonds at 3% anymore.This is definitely what I would do. I’ll never be in this position because I don't have the balls. I’m hesitant to do options.Just the largest buy is 750k. Guy was already rich.He actually only started with 53k, but as calls expired he bought more calls and shares, so it increased his cost basisHe actually only started with 53k, but as calls expired he bought more calls and shares, so it increased his cost basis

Additionally, you are ignoring his large number of shares, so that is a hedge already compared to his options.u/j1187064 have you apologised?The comments. THIS IS WHY YOU MUST HAVE CONVICTION.Remember how wrong that moron u/j1187064 was?Lol, check out [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpwjy8/gme_yolo_monthend_update_oct_2019/f60dsd8/).

Also clicked through to Zer033x’s profile (the person who's telling him he's an idiot)...he last logged in 9 months ago to say “I only do short plays lately.” 

So, uh... RIP /u/Zer033xWhy March?His self-reply to post you linked, speaking to Alexa is even more hilariousu/j1187064 hahahaha retard you were such a cocky cock sucker back then look at this now bet you wish you were this guyu/J1187064 how'd you do last year?Fucking legendaryWhat an absolute fucking KING.I fucking jizzedReally incredible as an idiot to read this shit.  Super fascinating.Holy fuck. 

Hire this man as your live in maid.LmaooooAlexa remind u/j1187064 to delete his Reddit.I think exercise is the big dick move, But this man is playing 4D chess so whatever he does will be the right play....but wait, there's more!!!So I'm not trying to argue, but how can we confirm that. People wete saying shorts haven't moved all day but the only evidence I saw shared was only accurate as of 12/31.

Selfishly, I am asking because I want to make my first option play on GME tomorrow, but I want to ensure that we haven't missed the boat with a bunch of paper hands suppressing the squeeze action.so you're saying wait til next week and then beat your dick in the exec meeting instead.This wasn't a squeeze at all. Like only 1-5% covered and it wasn't even melvin probably. We have so, so, so much more to go. That's why nobody has sold yet.How do you know the short interest?This would be too much for my heart to handleHow do you check short interest? Yahoo only provides data from December 30th and I couldn't find anything newer. Thanks!He’s gonna double that Jan 15th call by next week!!!!!How do you track short positions in real time? You can see open interest in puts but those are dwarfed by the already open shorts. Not to mention volume was 14x normal today which means people could have been covering.What is the updated short interest?Plus he could keep fucking around and work for a little bit, let the principle grow...at the end of the day though, this guy fucking made ithe held for a year+, and sold around \~2-3M alreadyWhat if he’s in a tax advantaged accountHurry up Elon I need my fat fireDepends where you want live. 

160k in a big costal US city is nowhere near fatfire. Fire for sure, but not fatFire. 160k is nice dinners, fly first class domesticly, and a new 2bdr townhouse money, but it's not yachts, private jets, [rent a submarine money](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/ih7bcx/annual_costbudget_needed_to_own_a_private/).

In southern or middle of the US city though, yeah, you can live pretty damn well on that (still no submarine though).

Edit: Ya'll can down vote me all you like but it doesn't make me wrong. The top posts from the last week that mention net worths or salaries are:

- 3.8m net worth (they mention living in a MCOL city)

- 11m net worth

- 1m/yr income

- 800k/yr income

- 7m net worth

- An unspecified 8 figure net worth

Don't get me wrong, I'd looooove to have 4m in my pocket, but 160k/yr is not fatFire in a major US city.at this point he’s just stacking money for his kids, fucking wildY’all wild. If I hit $300k I’m going PT. $500k and I’ll probably quit.Me too, difference between me and him will be that it takes me 30 years to get to that number inflation willing.Homeless or dieI think a cool alternative is divide the amount into 10 or 20 pieces.  So for him at 5 million, 1/2 million blocks to ride various risky trade ideas.  .5M in PLTR, .5M in Steel and various WSB memes...but make sure the risk between the difference risky bets are corralated.2.69*

*NiceMillion MoneyzWhoa mister huge dick over hereThis is how diamond handed DFV is

Even as GME shot up to $38 and those Jan 20c went to like $18-$19, i knew he wasn't selling. 

Even as we faded throughout the day. I knew I'd see those 1,000 contracts at EOD.

2.6 mil in one day. Mother. Fucking. King.Theta on that dropped exponentially since they became ITM today. He’s safe and will probably exercise 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀Edited, thanksCan you link to it pls?Not every smart person can make big money in the stock market but every person making big gains in the stock market are extremely smart.

I've never seen single person in my life that have poor intelligence but make money in the stock market.

That comment thread should also serve as one hell of a warning to people on this sub who let others convince them to make a play, one way or the other. Don’t listen to the advice that people give you on the internet. (Unless their name is u/DeepFuckingValue and then you’re a certified retard for NOT listening.)They have locations, a brand, and customers + supposed tech revolution comingCan someone fact check that, that really doesn't seem rightFOMO is a hell of a thing when it comes to this subreddit.Bloomberg article said it probably wasn't the squeeze. Short interest hasn't changed much. Maybe some shorts got squeezed but the big shorts are still in.I thought I was mad retarded for holding onto my 4 dollar nio sharesI’m new to this sub. What’s that mean and what’s going on?Not to late?Did he tell you to stop? We should all be continuously jumping until we are all slathered in gains.Yes70k not 7Yes you can only lose your investment in calls. Puts can have extra loss to infinity if it continues to rise.Shit you right where’s the line startMods hate me"if you misused the flair, please change it."

Doesn't say he did misuse it, just warning himAdamantium handsJeebus.At this point I think he's gonna exercise them and keep holding the shares. He's in this to the end it seemsLooks it up, I hope the guy who sold him these options doesn't do anything drastic when January 15th rolls aroundAhhh, that makes sense! 

And thank you very much for the very helpful answer. 

I think Gamestop has had the image of something that is on it's deathbed for a while. 
Especially with the new generation of consoles, and the possibility of games going digital only. 
And it's debatable if it should just die in peace, but this is just a very fun example of "Reddit intervention". 

P.s: Sending you a giant virtual hug and a pad on the shoulder, for your service at Gamestop. I hope you are okay to this day.Wasn’t it luck that the prominent investor got involved though?  OP didn’t know that would happen.Ah yes now i understand it thank youYeah, but I'm too busying buying GME rneven at $32/share? which is crazy because it was $20 just yesterdayNo, he started with about $53k.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1g7x0/hey_burry_thanks_a_lot_for_jacking_up_my_cost/I'm in GOEV too brother. I don't think we should be complaining about being up 30% in the past 5 days, though 😂 our time will come brother. In @ $12.20 and I'm not fuckin selling!Late I know, I’m 1.5 months into Reddit just getting caught up!  $100 up on appl calls today and spreading my wingsDon’t know what that meansGahdamn. Next time I’ll know. All it takes is a couple big ones before a popReminds me of my furthest OTM put options possible that I bought when the covid crash started on the TQQQ. They went up like 500% in one day and I sold. Had 2 weeks on it. Probably would’ve been rich lolThank you sirOh I got that, but what does the info on each column mean?[deleted]okay good i feel betterDamn I bout in yesterday....perfect timing lmao. This guy is on another levelGod damn, I guess it's gonna be a sequel. The Bigger Shorter staring yours trulyI’ve seen the posts but 50k to 5m isn’t as impressive as $73 to 1M. Who doesn’t have $73?Right but that one trade alone 1/15. That’s what I was talking about.Because that’s some shit you only do if you know somethinThat’s what I thought. Unbelievable.What changed? Why didn't it go bankrupt?Got it, so he can buy 100 shares x 1000 contracts which is 100,000 shares. Gain is share price - contracted price, correct?Lmaooo noooooo I really do want to do this!After reading this a few times this is what I've got. Is it right?

He went long by agreeing to buy 

- 1000 futures at $20 in 2 days (cost of this was $72.6)

and 

- 1000 futures at $12 in 4 months (cost of this was $400)

right? 

By the fact that gains are 1million instead of 10k, I'm guessing each future is 100 shares.

He also owns 50k shares outright bought at $15, which are now worth 30 ea.

Did he effectively turn $500 into 3 million or did I horribly misread some part of this?They’ll only expire worthless if the the calls aren’t in the moneyAnd you guys will call me Diamond Hands??Thank youthanks!That much is true. I am a retard. No idea how I got approved for options trading lol.ohhh i see it now. Thanks.Yeah i never operated with options!
But in case he doesn't have that kind of money, he can just sell the options for -almost- the same profit, right?
edit: whats the point on exercising the calls? I only see it as a PRO if you really want to get the stocks and keep holdingSome are apart of it with the goal to never have to work again... So yea. A few million needs budgeted to last if you're young.Thanks yes I saw the lord’s history, but in RH for example if I wanted to buy anything like a Jan 21/2022 42c and up, there’s no contracts to buyIf I wasn’t stupid I would’ve been rich by now....why would it go up and hit$40?That doesn't really change the problems I mentioned. GameStop is at the same place Blockbuster was after Redbox and Netflix got super successful. There's a ticking clock on the brick and mortar game stores and I don't think a new board member is going to change that. And my point is not that I'm right because even if I'm wrong I wouldn't understand why I was wrong and not understanding something is a stock I stay away from. That's all I was saying.Well then okayWhat’s his YT?What I mean is who pays out? Where does that money come from?[deleted]Ok thanks for clarifying.No, it means he has until April to be right. He's already right. Hence all the green.Took the words rifhr out of my mputhWho the fuck has 50k to YOLO away?He’s been in this play since 2019, check his post historyYou're right, I'm retarded.Cuz the underlying went up ?? Ain’t it obviousLike I was in the /r/wsb special olympiadbro its a genuine question this is my first time seeing thisThat is possibly the soundest advice I have ever heardWho’s Cohen? Steve Cohen? $14,000,000,000 Steve Cohen? I get it point72 ownership in $GME lmaoSHES JUST FUELING UPThanks for the info. I’m good.Uhhhh 50000 shares times 14.89 purchase price is 744k smooth brain. That’s just for the shares. The 4/16 options alone were 40kI prefer "slow adult" or "mildly autistic" thank youGameStonkRight but how much did he drop for this?In the land of the dumb money blind, king is king.King of diamond handsOr retard king? DeepFuc**KING**ValueAll hail, king of the losers!


*does anyone get this reference?*Not until those calls expire☝🏻All hail the one true dumb!MY PRINCEHey, it's a living.
We fucking post rocket ships. This guy did DD and had a timing horizon on his investment. Unlike us, he actually knows what he’s doing.Noob here, what makes you retarded and what makes you autist?I've been awarding 🥳Dude can pay for his own rewardsmy god it probably isOP is Jim Cramer.He can have both.GUH

GME 🛸🛸🛸What about “Melvin paid for this” 🔥  🔥  🔥Well GameStop probably will go under before long, doesn’t mean you can’t make money from them in the mean time thoughwhat kind of retard doesn't give up after a 80% surge?What indicator do you check to see if a stock is easy to hard to borrowMay have done better if we hadn’t minted the peaches.would you mind putting this in english for me? Squeeze is when a stock goes in either direction from a lot of buying/selling?Confirmed! Buying more shares and calls tomorrow!Gonna wait to see what happens premarket before going in againduh you retard, its going to $420.69Sure you’re part of the dip this morning 🧐My super basic and retarded understanding is a stock rising enough to get everyone who shorted the stock (bet that it would crash) to panic, realize it's not going to tank, and cutting their losses before it rises even more, which causes it to rise even more. It's worth googling "short squeeze"I also did nothing but refresh the screen....which is funny as I have no GME shares700k loli think the OG yolo was around 50kQuestion from a new retard. If you do a call and make 70k let's say from a 10k premium. At expiration would you have to fork that 70k personally to get your 70k then sell? 1 option. And the other option getting your premium plus what you made in difference? Pretty much what I'm asking is how the fuck do you make money on calls .Same here. I bought 1K more shares. Pussied out on buy LEAPs yesterday. My conviction is nowhere close to DFV’s.Thank you for your serviceA buddy of mine put me onto Zomedica at $0.17 last month which rallied to $1.45 before cooling off to around 90c, watching it go up 100% in a day got me addicted, ready to cash out my 401k for meme stocks nowMe too ༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ

AND

I will be buying tomorrow

Shorts have to cover sometime!

GME 🛸🛸🛸Would it be worth it for a n00b with not a lot of cash to throw around to put a few hundred into it at this point? Or is it still a go with your gut thingdude! And it was OVER 100% at one point today. Like When it hit 38.50 I almost could not look away from my phone for 10 minutes straight.90% at one pointI picked up more shares too. Up to 103 with an average buy of $20.30Today?? Do you not think this is the peakAt this point, if TSLA rose 60% in one day, the SEC would probably close the markets for a month to avoid its market cap overcoming the world's GDP.Why is GameStop going up? I'm out of the loop. I thought they'd be an obsolete company.Nope. I have 100 shares bought at 19.xx, and planning to buy more at mkt open tmrwNo, I just went back for more!YesOn the cybertruck waiting listI’m my own boss and I just up and killed myself.

I make 200k a year and i just bought a minivan.I really hope the guy gets a vanity plate on his lambo that says GME B0yAnd taxesFuck the Lambo - which color bedmates he wants.If he’s held for a year it’s only 20%. Not too shabby overall. I’d be happy to owe 1 mill in taxes.that's what a roth is for, anyone on WSB not using their roth deserves papa IRS's 13" deluxe rubber horse schlongHe has it all in a 401k.. no tax til withdrawalPosts like these are so stupid.I’m pretty sure that’s from past profits on gme optioks he sold thoAhh gottcha still a hefty chunk to start with.

Enjoy your new flare sonHow much must u/j1187064 be kicking himself knowing he just missed out on the trade of a lifetime in exchange for a few points of karma?Totally agree, if you don't believe in what you are buying. No one will. That is how you create a fortune!Yea screw that guyQ1 earnings but also that's when this user tried to schedule a reminder to laugh in dfv's face. I'm gonna guess you didn't read before commenting which means you belong here.Q1 earnings I guesshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJoBMayjlUoDoes $GME make mounds and mounds of Julienne Fries?Serious!!! There is that much more out there?!?I'm pretty sure we won't know for weeks.

But, over 100 million shares traded for no apparent reason. That's a value of 3 billion, trading in one day. The company is worth less than that amount, in total market cap.

Something big happened today. The size of the volume doesn't even make sense unless you believe almost every single short was closed today all in one mad rush. I think 70 million are short...so if the majority of them were covered today that might explain.

Though, that would be *incredibly* stupid for short sellers because as soon as they kick the price up that much they risk having algos come in to ride the wave. It would be far better for them to edge out over a period of weeks.

Nothing about the action today makes sense. Suddenly the whole country wants gamestop stock?You could always buy puts instead. 

If you hate money.You missed the boat. I doubt 1% of the users on this sub have diamond hands. They are all talk and want you to buy in so you can hold their bags. When GME hit the $30’s today the smart ones sold and the rest are going to let their options expire worthless. 

People will continue to try to pump GME here while offloading their positions until GME becomes the new PLTR and the sub moves to the next meme stock.Anybody have any ideas as to what prompted OP to invest in GME way back?Stock goes up 70% in a day.

Hope I didn’t miss the boat!I'd like to know too, if you have any info please reply. The volume indicates something that's for sure, so I got outExactly. They are wrong. Short holdings get reported every two weeks.>How do you track short positions in real time?

You have to pay for this data.Man if you keep working with that stash you’re just wasting time not enjoying life. You could be in a car wreck or get diagnosed with cancer at any time. Unless you love your job, you’re just being a greedy bastard imothere's 0 point working at this level.Most people don't think of "yachts, private jets, and rent a submarine" as FatFIRE. FatFIRE is living large, but not living like a hundred-millionaire. Most people over at /r/fatfire are targeting numbers like this: 4MM, sometimes as high as 10MM, but generally in this range. Regular old fire/leanfire takes a good deal less than 4MM.

What you're describing is like obeseFIRE or something."if it floats, flies, or ducks, you're better off renting it" private jets are the worst thing to own ever, out company does hundreds of millions of dollars and that jet just bleeds money.

Idk if he plans to exercise and keep the shares.Probably bought them today.Will it affect it that much though? He has the right to purchase 100k shares. There should be enough volume to cover that.Fuuuuck me I’m YOLOing my entire portfolio into GME 21c 4/16 at market open tomorrow

u/zUltimateRedditor

I told you, buddy!!Who tf is melvinBut even if he doesn't exercise and sells, someone will eventually have to exercise it right? (whoever ends with it)Will the price skyrocket cuz they sold naked calls?Wouldn’t it be of interest to just sell the calls instead of executing the option? Like what’s actually drivin the price? I heard chewy execs joined the boardVibraniumGive me a prescription for that!I had to take a couple Valium today watching my account swell like a balloon. WHAT A RUSH.BadassiumSo he will buy another 100k in shares at the price of $12 (1.2mil cost) just for the 12c option.  The stock is worth $31 just as of now, with room upwards to go and no more expiration.  

So about 2mil is current value (similar to the option value listed) with *less* risk by owning actual shares

All from a start at .40cents/$40k starting point.He only has enough cash to exercise about half of them. Someone is gunna make a good chunk of change exercising 500 1/15 20c for himIf this prints even more for him tomorrow, I'm just going to assume he's leagues more intelligent than everyone here.This is both the right and wrong subreddit for this. BravoA camel toe is a camel toeIt’s right but I didn’t fact check itAfrica's GDP is literally 1 million times higher.

Although that's in a year with a billion people, so on a per day basis he's done the work of 365,000 Africans.All of africa and USA is in debt so yeah it make sense.I aint missin outI thought short interest was only released every few weeks?The stock has been over shorted!  In basic speak, assholes betting against the stock short sold more shares than there are of the actual stock to buy, which is illegal.  GameStop has a lot of value still and stockholders know that.  The short sellers keep trying to beat the price down because they have unlimited risk if the stock price starts to rise to fast for them to buy back their shorted shares.   The squeeze is what happens when all the short sellers try to vacate their position, the buy back their shares, increasing the share price, and compelling more short sellers to do the same.  Last one holding the short bag at the top gets completely wrecked, and all the GME gang makes shitload of money.   

What happened today was based off of the board of directors restructure and holiday sales and a ton of new interest in where this company is going.  It’s possible that some of the short sellers started to liquidate their positions today but it isn’t the big squeeze yet so there is still time to get on.  

I believe that this is currently the most shorted stock right now.   All the publicity it is getting is a good thing as people will probably want to jump on before it really pops off.There is a days to cover number floating around that you can look up which is how long it is expected for all the shorts to buy out there positions, and it is several days if not over a week or more, so once the squeeze happens it should take place over several days.  Hold on until you can’t hold on anymore.  Even if it doesn’t squeeze this stock should be a good long term play.The squeeze hasn’t even started.  I bet those fuckers are scared though.  The rocket just did a static fire.  Hop on before it’s too late Holmes.DFV is Simon?.... makes senseWhen buying options you can only lose the value of the purchased options. When selling options, puts can only go to 0 from your strike, calls can go to infinity if they are not covered.Only if you don’t own stock though right (as in only if you are short selling)He’s already finishedWhooshWho knows, the stock market is a circus.

Lol thanks, I’m alright, we only got robbed twice!It’s like seeing a big field, watered and fertilized, and saying, “I bet a plant will pop up here.” Something was going to happen with a company with so much potential.undervalued (1.4bn market cap in huge industry) loyal customers, lots of data 
Cohen - look at Chewy/the other guys he brought onto the board 
potential for short squeezeI'm in for 1300 shares at 17 and bought 150 more at 31. Might liquidate everything tomorrow and go all in.I stand correctedLmao, fly brotha!!  I am by no means a big fish.  I make about 100 bucks a day, and I lose about a hundred bucks a day in the market ( while I go to work and make about 16 an hour to pay my rent).  Who cares about what you read on wsb.  Whatever you're doing sounds like it's working.  Profits, are profits!

Edit.  But for real, did you actually buy IN TODAY?  i've been pondering the short squeeze on gme for over a month now.  Never bought in.  I almost took yesterday's change of government as a sign to buy in...

 Didn't.Do you need to be spoon fed? Google “short squeeze” and “VW 2008”.Yeah it's insane. Like, if I had just put $200 in RH and yolo'd that for 100 contracts, I would've made $161,000 had I timed it perfectly lol.  Even if you don't, you're at the very least leaving the day with a 100 baggerI feel that man. I had calls in July for AMZN for a $2900 strike price. This is when it mooned like $4-500 in a three day span. I spent $500 on two calls that I sold for 1k total profit but had I waited 24 hours those calls would have net me 40kNope,  2.686mil today. 572k on shares and 1 mil each (and change) on both of his 2 options.The Big Short 2: Attack of the 🌈🐻sstill pretty fucking amazing. did you see that guy who turned 60 bucks into 17k today ?Ah okay, you mean he should have sold those calls for Jan 15 because it seemed as though it was unlikely they would come up trumps? 

What if he just let them expire? He'd lose the 7k placed on them?Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy, took interest and has a plan for their turnaround. He took significant stake into GME, upped that position it in Dec, and it was just announced this week that him and two of his former heads at CHEWY were all brought onto the board of GME.


Bottom line. Shorts are fucked. GME has risen once a fucking gainYou got it. There’s more nuance to the intrinsic value of options but that’s close enough.Well, evaluate your personal risk tolerance and try not to end up working behind your local Wendy’s. 
Tendie Hill is made of the bodies of many an autist. For every winner, there are many losers, and this is a zero-sum game. 

That being said, if you’re tired of regular old nihilism, wsb is a great place to engage in capitalistic extreme nihilism. Godspeed.He bought all these a long ass time ago. These are options. The price paid is per share and each option is worth 100 shares. So really he turned $47,000 into $3 Million. Also turned $744,735 into $1.57m via shares. It ain't much, but it's honest work.He is making calls, thats why the insane increase. His is a diamond hand god because he hasn't sold, even after todays wild ride. He has inspired all of us to hold on and buy in more! You too can be this retarded.no problem. we’re all idiots hereYea he can just sell them. Assuming theres people out there willing to buy

Its hard to say because those are so in the money with a near expiration. So he’s better off just exercising.That’s my goal but I want enough to live comfortably, not budget frugally and hope it lasts.He rolls them out every few months for whats availableWho pays for it? The buyers pay for it. Same place money comes from if a house or a car goes up in priceBecause its going up tomorrow retardIf they don’t already know abt deep then they arent from here. Fucking idiotLook at his post history and find out.He started last year with 40k on gme and now he's here today. Big brain.Can u do math?Go back to his original posts, smooth brainBro just look at his post history. It’s all thereHe has 3 plays. The first one I get - yeah he needed a lot to buy the stock. But the middle one he only spent $7k, the bottom one he spent $40k.  He didn't have to spend anywhere near $700k to do the options plays.  The middle one alone is probably the most impressive.  Just a measly $7k -- > $1M. That's basically just turning some stimulus checks, a tax return, and a little bit of savings into $1+M.**THE KING IN THE TARDS!**In the land of no brains, the man with half a brain is a genius.King of gamecockHahhahaha good oneSwuboo

EDIT: wrong game!  I'm a moron.Have you seen this guys cock? No 🌈🐻 could handle him.People that belong here posting their loss porn.Yesterday I was overall up more than 110% on my GME shares. The shorts didn’t give up during that run up. So here is your answer: the kind that has been shorting GME!I may be wrong but i think market makers shorted more stock in order to prevent a real squeeze, where they would lose billions probably, at one point the stock was rising over a doller a minute, but they managed to break that trend, it's better for them to slowly exit their short position than to lose them in a real squeezeIs...is wsb shorting GME? Only we are this retardedSame kind still holding out hope after Cohen got involved months ago. And again after he joined the board.The same people who post loss porn around here. Diamond hands work both ways.We need a few 80% days until we get to the price target of $420.69If he pulled out after an 80% gain he would have cashed out last year with $90k100%ONE OF US ONE OF US ONE OF USMelvin CapitalSomeone who calls his fund Melvinwell, mine maximum loss when shorting XPEV was over 100% :) but i diamond handed it to around 20% before covering my short positionsUs?pppl who have way more money than you and can hold their shorts for yearsThis retard. I jumped on at the top today then had to average down by turning on margins. God speed artistsGoogle itYup, sold as soon as I saw that huge sell-off, sorry 😞 but I had to secure some gainsI did not do anything at work once the markets were open either, shitUse Webulls app for live price streamingThat's his current cost basis but I think that's after he rolled forward gains from previous contracts. I think the out of pocket money he yoloed may have been $70K.Earliest post I could find

Then I was like “nah, it’s probably the top” 🤦‍♂️I bought more too. Im a little fish, bought another $200 worth for 25 shares total but fuck it im in the game!Hahahaha see you in the soup kitchenIt hasn't squeezed yet. And valuation should put it at 40 bucks a share. So it's still pretty good.
just look up gme in wsb history for tons of relevant ddthey have been going down forever because of declining sales and shitty management in general

yesterday they reported holiday earnings and it BLEW past expectations, so it swung the other way

also some members in this sub were betting massive amounts of money in PUTS and CALLS increasing the swing and volatility .Do u set the order now already or wait for the market to open to see how it goes?dittoI bought 4 shares of GME and 11 of PLTR. YOLO, right? lolWernstromNetherite handsBreak this down for meDo you not know any of this story? This dude didn’t have millions he made millions off GMEhe bought these so long ago. No way he spent close to a million on this playSir this is a short busIt is when you got several lambos in the bankSuper low mileage lease. 2K miles a year for 3 years. 2K a month, 20K down. Spend almost a hundred grand over 3 years to not even drive round trip across the US.It's an apprciating asset long Lambo 🚀🚀Live on 75k for two years and get the lamboWhy not? You can easily save enough on 150k a year. He can make more money, do other things, etcWhen you have that much in the bank, you can afford to take some spending money out here and there. And when you're making 150k year/ for life, you can splurge more because most of your cash is your savings. You dont need to put money aside like the regular Joe. You LITERALLY have, 150k spending.Normal piss, overhydrated piss, or morning after drinking heavily piss?You can still buy a Lambo on 200k a year easily enough.  Just because you didn't has no real bearing on anything.Tell me you got a new red Sienna.It’s a call option. He’s not going to hold for a year.Wait you Americans pay taxes? 

Laughs in TFSAAnd that’s why you are a retardOptions are still taxed as short term gains, regardless of length of holdingRoth only works for the poors. $130k(?) income limit and $6-7k max deposit per year.Google is telling me u have to pay taxes on all gains if you withdraw before age 59.5 plus a 10% penalty. Seems useless if I cant spend my gains for 30 years. 

What am i missing?You can only get $6k a year into a Roth. Itd take forever to get to this level of a gambleHonestly lol. The funniest shit is people see this post and think they can do it too, and will toss their entire 5k life savings into an option or two and then it’ll all be gone.LMAO let's not roast this man and kick sand in his eyes. We've done enough. Just keep following DFV and hold the fuck out of those shares.I'm gonna laugh my ass off if that guy made fun of dfv, but then was like "eh, fuck it" and also invested a shit ton into gme.Cum in the eye will do that to you.him: "well back to mcdonald's I guess..."so am iPendulum swings both ways. But if you listen to nay sayers you always get bopped.The comment was so long ago (1y) that I assumed he meant earnings of that year not 2021 Q1. Thanks for clarificationWhy yes it does!The short interest dropped 50000 shares today, now it is only 67,980,000 shares shorted...out of 69M shares outstanding.  Ryan Cohen owns 9M ish shares with 13% of the company, Blackrock has 11M shares bought since 2/2020.  So, the shorts are STILL screwed.  I am hoping for another rodeo tomorrow!   DFV is still in,  I'm still in!!!GME is still hard to borrow.

Shorts have not covered.Wouldn't it make sense for them to bow out all at once as a "rip off the band aid" move, they do it all at once to ensure they are the start of the wave and aren't caught up in it? If all the shorts sold, then this means the run is essentially over yeah?After reading DD here last night, I was convinced it'd be held below $24 through Friday, so I was \*totally\* unprepared for the major rip today. I was lucky enough that I hadn't sold my 1/15 calls yet, and lucky enough that I set limit orders at prices that would give me a nice little profit on my cost basis, but NOT lucky (or smart) enough to cancel those limit orders & "wait and see" the incredible rocket that launched :(the word got outWhy even bring this up as a joke? Why would anyone buy puts in the short/mid term with all the facts we know?I mean I have shares, but yeah I guess just hold tight and do research and wait for my next opportunity.Now it's theta gangs time.PLTR I believe is a different game and just waiting for this mysterious lockupnto pass and next er to see what happens, I  cautiously agree with the GME sentiment sold near the top today.I have shares as well, I just also wanted to potentially do a low risk option olay. If this is going to squeeze harder, which has been talked about for months now, why wouldn't I try to maximize gains?I'm starting to feeling like I should have, but idk maybe this was several big players who are trying to force Melvin to crack? IdkDamn, so I guess the options are sell just before if you believe shorts have closed or hold through and hope there's still a bunch left?You could also just work doing what you enjoy.Yeah of course. When I graduated college I got a good sum of money from family members so I went backpacking across Europe. I had enough money to do and get whatever I wanted...I came home and chilled after that for a month or so before starting my job. That was what I envisioned retiring well to be like. Pure freedom. Except for me, I noticed I was happier when I had a goal, something to keep me challenged. I find that in my career now, so for me satisfying my need for challenge is what makes me happy. So if I got that much money or won the lottery I know I would still find a job that challenges me and I enjoy because that's where I'd be happiest. It's different for everyone though.

tl;dr waking up everyday rich but with no purpose gets oldI'll give you that renting a submarine is probably above the fatFire line (that was more a joke anyway), but I think you're wrong about the targets, especially for people who live in major US cities. Almost everyone I see on that sub that is in LA, SF, NYC is targeting 10m at least.

Just look at the top post right now, it's about whether they should hire a body guard for traveling. That's way more than a 160k/year lifestyle choice.

I read fatfire all the time and I can assure you with absolute certainty that 160k in a major US city is not enough to live the type of life that most of the people in there are talking about.Cincinnati. You can get a nice house in a good neighborhood for about $300k!Doubt itmelvin capital has 54,000 put options which is 5.4 million shares. I'm sure all of them are getting exercisedWhy 4/16 21c? That seems rather... arbitrary..melvin capital, they bought 54,000 15 P 7/16 on GMEMetallic hydrogen would be a good suggestion.AutisiumOr he could’ve sold this morning at the spike then can wait till Friday to buy more shares on the cheap since it’ll prob go back downIf those calls are still uncovered, that's going to cause a lot of shares needing to be bought immediately, further driving the price up. I love this.Idk man. Again - he killed it, but the smart move would have 100% been to roll them out last week or even earlier. This is pure weaponized autismYet africa is the richest continent in natural resources. Congo alone is huuuge (bigger than maps show) and has a ridunkkkuluous amount of natural resources. Economic imperealism and exploitation fucked africa hardLmao let's start converting gains into the equivalent of what the average African makes in a year.Thanks! Safe to say it’s a bit too late to jump in on this but I’m guessing Palantir is the next one to jump on from what I’m seeing?Oh man thanks! I might just drop a good amount on it now and see it out although I’m not really sure how to tell when the “can’t hold on anymore” point would be.Thanks for the correction but maybe I read it wrong i was speaking about buying calls/puts, not selling them. But either way I'm a tard so....Believe so yes. I'm not so versed in shorts. But as basics go yeah. Then there's naked calls/puts as well[https://i.imgur.com/1okIten.gif](https://i.imgur.com/1okIten.gif)Why did the potential for short squeeze exist?I only understood about half those words, because I'm not a WSB chad :( maybe one day I'll learnlmfao best of luck m8He's rebalanced his positions a few times, so you can't tell from this post alone. Easy mistake to makeYa it’d be totally worth it because we knew GME would pop off and even if it didn’t +90% in one day we’d still make a profit buying options that expire at the end of the week. Gahdamn I’ve been meaning to get into this. Some guys like “trade like rocket” on Instagram solely do options like this to catch movements and make a killing. I’m joining now lolGahdamn. It really teaches you. Some people take this as you always lose but I see this as a learning opportunity lol.I did not. Technically still working just zoning out to reddit for a bit.No, who??Well he’s gonna exercise them so no, he’ll pay exercise costs and then get to buy all those fuckin shares. It means Friday we’re going green thanks to this gayYea I'll continue to research this stuff. I want to test it out so I can make more but I just don't quite understand it well enough to do that.Lmfao. I love this sub.

Engage all capitalistic extreme nihilism thrusters to the max. My body is ready.So he made a call to purchase 1,000 shares of GME for $0.07 per share and that call option expires on Jan. 15th? And now GME is worth $11.40? So he could sell his contract right now for $11.40 per share? Or he has to wait until the 15th?

Also, what does the "$20 Call" next to Jan15th mean on the left? And how come each GME has a different "Last Price"?

Sorry, trying to learn a bit so I can be in on the excitement.and in the specific case that there is noone willing to buy, and he has not the money to buy all these stocks, he's fucked?Ah crap I have no idea what rolling options means, google time! Thank you kind sir for guiding this autist towards the light!> He could realistically hit 10-20 million in the next several weeks.

But he'll own the stocks, will he not? Does it make any difference if he exercises now vs later? He pays the same price per contract, right?He edited it to “4-6 months” lmfaooo I’m dead he too tarded even for this sorry ass forumExcuse me for not creepinAm I supposed to check every users post history that post a gain?

What happen to WSBBro, this whole thread is the definition of r/agedlikemilkI won’t bore you with actual numbers but at this market cap currently GME is ridiculously undervalued.

The moon will be in the rear view shortly as we begin the approach to Mars!

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀thanks!Thanks for the answer. This is actually one of my first times on /r/wallstreetbets. I saw this thread on the frontpage.

Last week, I decided to start investing in stocks after a friend's girlfriend finally admitted that she invested in NIO back when stocks were $13/share and she's now sitting on over $10k. I wish she had told me about it when she first invested in it. She got the tip from her employer.Probably just see how it goes; might even buy at pre-mkt if it’s going strongAll of this is so handy.Holding for over a year reduces your taxesif he exercises and holds long enough then he can get long term cap gains tax rate instead of short term cap gains (income tax) rateHis initial outlay was something like $48k.Sir, this is a Wendy'sHoly fuck I howled laughing at this, if I was financially able to afford awards I would!LMAO I’ve never heard this phrase used before and I’ll be stealing it from now on; thank you.... and OP is drivinIs there a Lamborghini short bus? OP should get one.Fuck leasing. I’m buying and doing a Gumball.I’ll sell you those calls anyday.Piss should be perfectly clear r/hydrohomiesI mean yeah, if i didnt have a house, daycare, and save for retirement i could theoretically spend a ridiculous portion of my income on a car.So out of curiosity a new aventador is 421k.  My house was 450.  On a standaed 5 yr loan thats 8500 a month assuming i take out a loan.  At 200k a year my monthly income after 401k and taxes is just under 10k.    Yeah.  Easily!!!
200k - 10% 401k * 65% after taxWhite Honda Odyessey.  To be honest im pretty happy with it!Hes been hard in GME for a year now with posts oftenHe’s been holding the Jan 15s for over a year now, since Dec 2019 I believeYou'll get taxed if u cashout from the TFSA no?That is simply not true... only true if you’re selling options.Only if you try to move the money into a roth, and not make money _inside_ the roth. Not all of them give you full freedoms on what you can invest in, but if you find one that lets your yolo all of your tendies  on calls you dodge all tax until withdrawl.Back door Roth to get around income limits. Then mega backdoor Roth for even more.Roth 401ks have no income limit.I believe non-qualified withdrawals are treated as taxable income, plus 10%. You'll pay more in taxes but who cares when you've got that much? It's all monopoly money at that point.You spend your brokerage account gains until 59.5 then even though you blew all your tendies on coke and hookers behind the wendy's you are still a tax free millionaire via the RothYou’re not missing anything. The benefit of a Roth is no taxes on gains when you’re at retirement. It was never meant to me a way for people to yolo on options and cash out millions tax free at age 19.If you run a small business being a trader you can use a SEP to sock away a lot more money. But that just seems like a lot of steps.I mega backdoor over $30k a year into my Roth IRA.True. I don't think such a low limit exists for a roth 401(k) though. At least, I'm too poor to have triggered it. I always go off the assumption that the average WSBer will start with 4 digits and either blow it or hit it big. This isn't r/investing lolTake $5k and get two ten baggers, you're at 500k tax free. 

Unlikely but people here have done it.You can do a conversion from a traditional IRA into a Roth without any limit.  However, you will have to pay tax that year...So if you want to convert 100K IRA into Roth, you will have to pay income tax on that 100K.I have well into 6 figures in my Roth and I've only been working for 5 years...I’d agree with you if he was just wrong. But he was a douche and wrong. 

I’m allowed to be a douche and right.No. Let’s pry open this douchebag’s throat and shit down all our Wendy’s remainingsAgreed, leave them alone. Except give them the flair: "Gamecuck".this is the wayI fucking hope he didUser flair checks outHim also: "that DFV guy can McFuck himself"Where did you get thisOr they have covered and rest are just bagholding we won’t know til market open, premarket will still be bagholders with nobody buying so price will levitate.  We will see a singular direction am...waiting til thenThe problem with that is that there literally is not enough shares to cover all the shorts. So no matter what they are caught on the ride up to unwind some of their positionsWhat do we know?I’m not saying it’s done sailing but that was the boat leaving port my dudeErrr idk what you’re talking about. Do your DD and build a view on the stock and what it’s worth? The institutional shorts won’t have covered unless they believe their thesis is no longer valid, or if there are technical (non fundamental) reasons that they now think are present which will prevent them from getting paid... like for ex, massive and persistent retail inflows (you guys) combined with a near term lack of catalysts.I'm with gorilla though. I think the great majority of people would be calling themselves quite rich on 160k a year. Especially with no mortgage or rent,. You can call it not-fatfire if you want but man. If I can travel a few times a year and eat and shop without having to look at my bank account that's all I want in life and from retirement.

Don't forget no car payments because you'll have a lambo already. Well, probably a Tesla Model S Plaid for me.Downvoted for speaking  the truth. 

160k is not fatfire. It is fire.  200k maybe is low tier fatfire for a single person.Thanks!I am an options noov and confused. Has melvin sold or bought puts? If they had bought (which makes sense because they are bears on GME) then their puts expire worthless. How does that affect the stock price?Put options wouldn’t be exercised unless they’re ITM. If a bear bought put options and the stock is up 60%, their options (which they paid a lot for) are just going to expire worthless. No exercise involved.Make it 4/20 pussyJesus they're idiots.beskarLOL shut up, you cannot doubt this man.I guess, everyone has different viewpoints on it.

He could have sold the contracts, and the price doesn't 'go back down' then he doesn't have that option to get those shares at 12 bucks without spending more on the premiums to rebuy contracts.I suspect you attend my alma-matterthis is why they want the paris climate accordsyea lets not bud, have a seat over hereI think now is the last chance to get in, maybe a dip tomorrow but it is looking ripe.  I’m sure a lot of GME post squeeze money will make its way to PLTR.  I think I have a feb call that should print.Yeah who knows when that will happen.  I’m strapped in for the long term gains regardless of a short squeeze happens or not.  If it happens I’ll cash and reinvest when it dips.  You can always set a trailing stop, but you just have to watch it so it doesn’t shake you off like what happened today.  Anyone who had a trailing stop would have sold after the peak automatically.  Hopefully they reinvest before it booms again, otherwise they will miss out.When buying, you can only ever lose what you put in. This infact makes it a safe bet.... around here.cos they expected GME to go down the shitter but it hasn’t so they have to coverYou just have to be so careful man. We're seeing all the big winners but there are thousands of losers who don't share. You really have to be okay with losing 100% of what you invest with at any given time.Most brokerages have pretty helpful educational content for options. If you’re just looking at long calls and puts there’s not a lot to it.“Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate”1. Take everything you have, dump into robin hood. Buy GME. HURRY ITS ALMOST TOO LAATEYea but very slim chance. Im sure funds have bots that just eat up in the money options like these. 

Plus theres always a way to find money if you really need to, I heard kidneys go for 200k ish soooSell and reroll it outI said it's been talked about for 4 - 6 months you fuckin retard, that's the first time I remember Sir Jack A lots post or Deeps post. either way that has absolutely nothing to do with me answering the persons question. what the fuck is your deal ?Yes sirAs long as you are perceived to be working, you are working!Or there is me, an idiot: opened Reddit and saw this post after work. I'm a fool.Haha I have been working late many nights and people think I’m working hard. Working late just means starting work at 4 pm and playing catch up.Right? It's crazy that the initial investment was only 30k or 20kYou are ALL wrong.  It was a $20 dollar blow job, his one and ONLY.  He then invested that $20 dollars and the rest is history.

&#x200B;

I am on my 14th blowy and it doesn't get any easier :(Options.  Rather than buy the stock, you can (less expensively) buy the right to buy the stock at a certain price in a certain window of time.  And the value of that right rises when the stock price rises, with higher returns than owning actual stock.

It is much riskier, as that right also depreciates as the window of time that you paid for grows shorter and shorter, often eventually expiring worthless.  (Compare this to holding stock, where if the stock does nothing you simply break even instead of losing everything.)

When Gamestop stock was like $2 a share or something any everybody thought they were done, one could buy the right to buy Gamestock shares at $20 a share for a 6 month window for $0.07 per share (disclaimer: this is made up info to explain the concept, I don't know when OP bought the options).  This would have been crazy, right?  Why would u pay for the right to buy a stock for $20 a share when it is selling for $2 a share on the open market? (In other words, the right to buy a share at $20 only has inherent value if the share is worth MORE than $20 on the open market.)

The reason is because you are a God.  Now that the stock is trading for $31 a share, the right to buy a share of GME at $20 a share is inherently worth $11 (plus a bit extra for the chance of more gains) since one could immediately exercise their right and buy a share for $20 and sell it for $31.  So he paid $0.07 for the right to buy a share, and that right is now worth $11.40.  And he did it for 100,000 shares.Luck was definitely a factor(COVID gaming spur, RC etc) right. But damn did he get it rightPlease bore me with the numbers thoughFuck yaAnd that's how we play handy hands.So you can exercise options into shares without triggering a "sale" according to the IRS?[deleted]That's the way to do it!Yup, he doesn’t need to save for retirementSaving for retirement's cringe lmfaoYour own damn fault

https://i.imgur.com/gNAVbVI.jpgIsn't a Huracan like $200k? I dunno why you'd go for some high end model. May as well go for a Veneno.

Also I though aventadors were more like 350-375Dude just live off of $1500 a month like the rest of us poors 🤣🤣🤣What a legend. I thought his options were from somewhere since the wsb hypeJesus, 2020 really blew past me.Nope, that's the whole benefit of it. Put in after-tax dollars and let it grow tax free + withdraw tax free.At what age can you withdraw money from your Roth though?You can only really backdoor Roth though if you actually work for a company that offers it I believe.


I can backdoor Roth with my 401k contributions at my current company but I'm not working till I'm 60 something years old to withdraw it so I don'tTIL. What’s a mega backdoor Roth?so why open up a roth to leave 10% at the table? 10% of 4M is still 400k, how's that monopoly money?

edit: so I just did some math, let me know if this is wrong:

Roth account scenario:

Starting with $200. Assume you make 5 plays, netting 20% profit each time, you'll have $415. Assume you'll pay %40 tax, which leaves you $307.

Taxable account scenario:

Starting with $200. Assume same profit (20%) and tax (40%) for each play.

Entry Cost/End Price/Tax/Profit

$200/$240/$16/$224

$224/$268.8/$17.92/$250

$250/$301/$20/$280

$280/$337/$22/$314 ---> left with $314. you actually pay 2% more in Roth with early withdrawal penalty.

now if you do $4M instead of $200, that 2% is $150K. Even though it doesn't seem much, it is a significant amount to loose for no good reason.That's about what I've got into your mom.

Tell her I'm sorry I missed breakfast again.Ya we deserve to kick sand in his eyes lolFair enough.Who hurt you?Spot onExperience counts for a lot.lmao

I bet u/DeepFuckingValue will be at 10m$ before u/j1187064 will be out of McDs (sucking Ds for a living ofc)Yahoo financeBut u/Objective_Stage just said, the volume alone shows that a huge number of shorts were closed today, he seems to think it was a very large percentage. If that's the case, then the majority of the squeeze played itself out today.Have you not seen all the rocket emojis?That reading these comments gave me all the autism I need to sustain me.Ryan Cohen is the more handsome Elon Musk of e-commerceThats cool my shares are still printing so its all good. Probably better i do some actual research and make a real play lolI mean that's what my heart tells me: that if anything, NOW was be when the shorter think their thesis is blown up and will start panicking. But my head says I can't possibly get this lucky so I'm becoming a 🌈🐻 out of fear.Who says there's no mortgage or rent though? If you're taking out enough money to buy a house in cash (assume 1.5m to buy a decent place in a major city) then your safe withdrawal rate drops to about 100k. That's still enough to live a fantastic life, but again, it's not on par with what the people in fatFIRE talk about.

> If I can travel a few times a year and eat and shop without having to look at my bank account that's all I want in life and from retirement.

I'm totally with you here, I'm not saying I wouldn't take that lifestyle. Shit, I'd take it in a heartbeat. All I'm saying is that it's not on par with the way people in fatFire are living.Right?!

I think people just don't want to hear it because it makes them sad even 5m dollars isn't enough to live the life they're dreaming of.

Also, just want to clear something up, I am in no way shitting on DFV. Dude is a baller and I'd chop off my leg to be in his position, all I'm saying is that it's "fire" and not "fatFire" if you live in a super HCOL area like LA,SF, or NYC.MM are going to hedge those puts by selling shares. When they expire, the MM is going to buy back shares. Probably. Technically they don't have to buy they need to keep an orderly market, and if they can't cover the calls people buy they'll go bankrupt. So they will.Look up 'perfect hedge'. The broker buys put options and sells call options so that the risk is completely eliminated.This is the wayMithrilYou think it’ll keep going tomorrow and Friday?He's literally holding the cash in hand which is just enough to exercise the calls.PossibryThat's basically what I was getting at lol. Naked puts on PLUG tho cant go tits up ;)Sorry to sound stupid but can you elaborate further, you mean they expected it to go into administration, but because it didn't. The shareholder options required covering?I know, I don’t like wasting money. But dropping 1 or 2k on something that’s a fairly safe bet to make money while also having the possibility to multiply seems like a good deal to me. I don’t like doing yolo options eitherGot it. Do you need a margin account for this or just an investment account? I'll use the Fidelity information section to read up on this stuff.Oh lawd. I'll split it with BB?lol. Thanks!Right so he could exercise the options and then sell his newly acquired stock.Nah you edited that 😂😂doodoodunderheadIf you're at your assigned desk, you're workingDon’t question the man in a $6,000 suit. Come on!Some say it was an advance on a $1200 stimulus checkI like how you explained that.Should be mentioned that if the opposite situation arose, that it was UNDER $20 after 6 months, the contracts would be worth absolutely jack. So he literally risks 100% of his buy in this wayBut in this case the max he would lose would be his initial investment if the price had gone down, right? He wouldn't be in the hole more than what he paid for options.So based on this chart he convinced someone to let him buy GME at 7 cents a share?/r/lostredditorsGrow a pair mate.In particular the retarded, if that makes you feel better.Call me crazy.  Ill take the kids over the car.So 4250 of 9500 ... almost 50% of my income on a carDaycare alone is 3200 a month.That’s our Roth IRA,  tax free growth except only call withdraw after 59.5Boomer ageAny time you want, and you only pay tax on the _earnings_ you pull out. If you toss 10k in there, make 20k on a yolo, you can still pull out the principle balance without paying a cent in penalties.

> You can withdraw contributions you made to your Roth IRA anytime, tax- and penalty-free. However, you may have to pay taxes and penalties on earnings in your Roth IRA. 

After that you just pay tax on what you pull out, while keeping the vast majority of your money untaxed and at maximum investment potential. Why pay tax on $5 million when you could just pay tax on $150k each year? You still pay tax sure, but it's not even 1% of your total worth each year which will only grow larger.100% you do not need to work for a company that “supports” backdoor Roth’s. 

I do a backdoor Roth every year and it has nothing to do with who I work for (aside from the fact that the money that goes into my IRA does have to be from income made). 

If you meant your company has to support mega backdoor Roth’s, then yeah that’s true since you ha e to use a 401k to fund it that route. But regular Roth IRA backdoors are independent of your company and have nothing to do with 401ks.You can google for more info but long story short is you can route money through your 401k to a Roth IRA and go beyond the 6k limit.Yeah, I don't think taking it out will usually be worth it. What is worth it is doing once you get a large amount (easier to grow it tax free) is to do what's called Substantially Equal Periodic Payments. Google does a better job of explaining than I would.Okay Big Boot Boris.So which Wendy’s do you work at, asking for a friend??This and also you wouldnt expect price to come back down that fast I mean it was done by noonMy target for fatfire is 10m. I'd  settle for fire ate 5m. Neither will get me a sub rental. 

I'm also happy living  in a small apartment and traveling  a lot.

A pet giraffe would be nice though. 


None of this has anything  to do with the ridiculous  GME gainz.Dude, you and I are not worthy to sully DFV's name with our doubts!!this guy is why the anti vaxxers existNot for long calls/puts. You’ll need a margin account if you want to get into spreads or other more advanced strategies though.yeah what did I say 4 months? so I edited it to 4 -6 months ? so what? it's a recollection not a fucking fact you retard. the fuck is wrong with you ?Yep, exactly. Now using the exact numbers from the chart, he bought the right to buy 100,000 shares at $20 a share expiring January 15, 2021 for $0.0726 per share, or $7,260.  That was his max loss (on that line in his chart.)Not exactly. It’s more like, “Hey, I’ll give you $7 (.07 per share for 100 shares) if I can buy GME from you at $20 a share on or before January fifteenth” and then whoever sold them the option said “lmao bet, there’s no chance in hell thats happening”

Now that GME is above the theoretical break-even of $20.07 per share (the strike price plus the premium), OP is DEEP DEEP DEEP in the moneyNo.  He convinced someone (call him Bob), who probably was holding shares of GME, of the following deal, likely a few months ago.  

"Hey Bob, GME is $2 a share but I have a crazy hunch it's going to $30.   I will pay you $0.07 a share if you agree that I can buy your shares from you at $20 per share anytime I want, at my option, before January 15, 2021."

Bob thinks about it.  He is essentially selling any gains above $20 a share to OP for $0.07.  If he doesn't think there will be any such gains, he is getting $0.07 for "free".  So he takes the money from OP.he bought 1/15 20cs at around $.07/contractDamn wish I had offered that dude 8 :([deleted]Well yeah at this point you've gotten to know them. If you never had them you wouldn't know it.If you like cars, more than worthIf you pull earnings/gains out of a Roth IRA before age 59.5 those are subject to 10% early withdrawal penalty^ Roth’sChildSo if I make to much money to contribute to a Roth I open a regular IRA say with vanguard and then they can convert it to a Roth?

So essentially to do this every year you need to open new Ira, convert  then asset transfer (of you want one account)?

Who do you use?That’s not true is it? Any IRA has a limit of $6k regardless of how it’s funded. The back door part is to get around the a $130k income limit. Or so I thoughtLel although I believe in vaccinations and their benefits, doesn't mean I can't be a tard <3. We all out here just trying to make money.
TSLA 1500 1/15c all day bois.Sweet, thanks for your help!What I don't understand, is with puts and calls, the seller and buyer is under no obligation to actually buy or sell. So how did we see all those 100k+ loses last year from options? I was under the impression that the WSBer lost a ton of money because they had to fulfill the contract and they guessed the market wrong. But, I think I'm now realizing that they just spent way more than OP on options that basically were worthless in the end. 

Side note: it also seemed to me that they stood to gain way less than OP while simultaneously putting up more money with more risk. Maybe it's like gambling and the guy that put up $50k with 3:1 odds lost and the guy that put up $7k with 300:1 odds won.But $20.07 per share vs current price of $31.4 is only a 51% gain, not 14,572% as the chart says? And wouldn't it just make more sense for him to have bought GME back when it was $4 instead of paying a premium to have an option to buy at 21?$0.07/share 

$7/contractYup, just buy a smaller house.I use fidelity. I have two IRAs with them, one traditional and one Roth. At the beginning of the year I fund my traditional. Wait a few days for everything to clear then transfer it to my Roth.

That’s it. You do need to make sure you report it correctly on taxes so you don’t double pay taxes. Personally I’ve found turbo tax handles it really easily, but there are guides online on how to report it for others. Here’s the turbo tax one I’ve used in the past: https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-report-backdoor-roth-in-turbotax.html

Edit: also I just leave my traditional Ira open with them. It’s just empty most the year.Good luck!Per share, they’re making $10 and change. For that $10 and change, they only paid 7¢. And that, of course, is only if they exercise the options and sell immediately. Otherwise, they can sell some of the contracts so they can afford to exercise the rest (AKA buy the shares for $20) and then keep holding since they think it’s going to go even higherThey’re not shares, they’re contracts! Bundles of 100 shares.Those traditional to roth conversions are still capped at 6k correct? Meaning if I had 10k I want to throw in a traditional and convert, on top of the 6k I already funded straight into my Roth, would I face issues?gotcha thank you for the explanation.It’s a shared max. You can only put in 6k into any kind of Ira. A backdoor Roth just skirts the issue of maximum income limits for Roths. If you put in 6k into a Roth you don’t get to put more into a traditional and convert it.10-4 thanks.
