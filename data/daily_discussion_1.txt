*sent from my iPhone*You'd think PLTR is some Chinese fraud with the frequency it gets attacked by analysts and shortsPLTR was finally breaking out and was looking good till Demo Day and of course some cucktard analyst comes in with a downgrade to tank this shit so they can buy in. Absolute fucking BS. Wait till the rest of WSB wakes up and sees the downgrade....we buying the fucking dipSo anyone know why PLTR is casually drilling to the center of the earth's core?stfu mom i'll drink as much monster and dump as many stocks as i want. it's my birthday.I’m black and even this bullshit is making me wanna dump my Apple calls lmfao 🤣⠄⠄⠸⣿⣿⢣⢶⣟⣿⣖⣿⣷⣻⣮⡿⣽⣿⣻⣖⣶⣤⣭⡉⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄ ⠄⠄⠄⢹⠣⣛⣣⣭⣭⣭⣁⡛⠻⢽⣿⣿⣿⣿⢻⣿⣿⣿⣽⡧⡄⠄⠄⠄ ⠄⠄⠄⠄⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⣌⡛⢿⣽⢘⣿⣷⣿⡻⠏⣛⣀⠄⠄ ⠄⠄⠄⣼⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⠙⡅⣿⠚⣡⣴⣿⣿⣿⡆⠄ ⠄⠄⣰⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠄⣱⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠄ ⠄⢀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠄ ⠄⣸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠣⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠄ ⠄⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠛⠑⣿⣮⣝⣛⠿⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠄ ⢠⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣶⠄⠄⠄⠄⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠄ ⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇⠄⠄⠄⠄⢹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠁⠄ ⣸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠏⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⢟⣣⣀#Tim aapl announces all employees must watch an episode of the wire before coming into workAAPLE'S NEW CAR POWERED SOLELY BY MINORITIESICLN paper hands morons in shamblesCiti just wiped out all these PLTR 30c holdersI DOWNGRADE MY PRICE TARGET OF PLTR FROM 45$ TO 55$.I hope Apple designs a phone for blacks only, and you’re not allowed to listen to Blink-182 on itDid... did I play TSLA correctly for once? Bought yesterday @ 825, sold @ 850.

Oh boy can’t wait to rebuy for cheaper today

I’m gonna make **tens of dollars**Tim Cook spoke at my college commencement and it was the worst speech I’ve ever heard, so preachy and fake woke like bro you literally have slave labor making your productsBuy PLTR. That is all.PLTR is ruining my reputation as a WSB traderMy favorite pre market activity is watching AAPL be up 1% and watching it bleed all the way down to red by open.PLTR finally started looking good and now this.Black airpodsOh wow Apple investing $25 million in Detroit? That’s the huge announcement??? 

Apple makes $25 million per second wtfBiggest lesson from 2020: if the company makes money, stay the fuck away from itTim Cook today announced that he can't be racist because he in fact has a black friend.Somebody really said “ARKK is up $7 from my investment, should I sell?”

Are some of you actually this retarded? Honestly, wow.Hey everyone, thought I’d try to bring you some alternative data every day in these daily discussion threads.

I got up at an ungodly early hour to post this right when the thread was made, so I apologize if I take a while to get a respond to any early questions, I'm sleeping till market open.

Here's what was mentioned the most in the "Tomorrow's Moves" thread for today:

|Stock|Mentions|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**TSLA**|345|\+39|
|**NIO**|260|\-36|
|**ICLN**|215|\+26|
|**GME**|113|\+35|
|**PLTR**|93|\+20|Fuck u Citi retards, im upgrading PLTR with a $50 PT 🚀🚀🚀🚀This apple shit is a sleezy way to cash grab at minorities getting stimmys.  Hey black people we support you!  Our phone still cost $2200 thoOn adderall and going to take a practice LSAT exam, wish me luck boys!*Buyden slaps roof of stock market*
"This bad boy can fit so many fucking ICLN pumps in it"Apples big announcement was they are cracking down on racial inequality.I really don’t care about this shit and I’m black. I’ve got 16 129 call options that expire on January 29Bout to DM the baddest chick I see on the gram and ask her when are you going to spend a night with an autistGOEV gonna open negative just to fuck with my sanity watchWtf is a downgrade from $10 to $15? Citi can go suck a dick.imagine 10 year from now somebody will be saying damn bro is that an apple icar 10 max plus proupvote if you are retardedIf ur selling PLTR at open idk what to tell you other than to enjoy ur lossesApple rallying on this racial equality news would be the most autismo thing everPalantir must have secured another contract for it to be dying this hard in PM.Jan. 12th: APPL has a big announcement that is NOT a new product.

Jan. 13th: WSB, why no product announcement!?Apple cracking down on racial inequality. What about all those Chinese you pay pennies to make your product🤔Valuable lesson: you should be most scared when you’re on a winning streak. Don’t get cocky. Don’t overextend yourself. If you feel you’re trading on emotion, walk away. There’s always another play and another day. 🤟Dropping another 10k into ICLN once the market open!What do you guys think is funnier, Apple's racial inequality program or the fact that they make their phones only in China and now IndiaWhen I drop $10k on a stock simply cuz someone put a bunch of rocket emojis next to it I feel like an investor. 

When I fill out mega millions and power ball tickets at the bodega I feel like a degenerate gambler.Trying to muster up all of my strength to pretend to give a shit on my 30 minute conference call. Once done, I'll stare at a line to see if it goes up or down until 430EST.Imagine being the ceo and your stonk moons 7% on your resignation

i dont know about you fellas, but this makes perfect sense considering I buy a new flatscreen tv every week while I only buy food once every 5 years.Just read the “big announcement” by Tim Apple and I am lost for words. A private corporation that produces all of its products in sweatshops in Asia wants to educate people on social injustice. America is truly in the middle age😂Loading up to the tits means you put in 80% of your portfolio into a single play, this is because, on average, the height from the ground to your nipples is 80% the height of your entire heightCiti is worse than CitronDaddy Karp should get on twitter so he can reverse uno card all these ghey downgradersCiti is against retards.

You use word “downgrade”, yet you increase PT. I do not think you know what word meansLast chance for the GME 🚂 our boy Cramer is gonna pump this shit todayICLN is doing the thingyAAPL is gonna be red by open and my calls will be fucked.I think APPLE made a mistake, people that care about racism know that is a poor atempt to wash their image as one of the biggest corporations that represents capitalism as It's worst, so they will not care about this program and at the same time they are moving away from part of the customers. Bad and expensive advertasing campaing in my opinion. On the other hand I am just an Europoor that bought PLTR 2 days ago so not the best one to give financial adviceCramer on team GME now 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀the market must be racistPLUG singlehandedly carrying ICLN to the promised landTim slept with a black dude and he comes out with a $100million initiativePalantearsAlright racism is canceled this year.

59.7/12 = 4.975 billion a month

Apple doesn’t ever share ANYTHING until close to launch, why would that change now, especially considering the EV would be the biggest announcement they’ve made since iPhone? Do you really think Timmy would just pop up on morning talk show to drop that shit with no presentation or keynote?Upgrade SNOW, which has had absolutely 0 news but downgrade PLTR. Makes sense.

On top of that I get 20% off minimum almost every order from some promotion they offer because they’re desperate not to lose market share to Uber eats/grubhub. They will never be profitable.Remember to buy GME today,

Palantir announced the Army down-selected it to deliver a prototype for the first phase of the Army's Ground Station modernization in support of the Army's Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node program. The contract value for this phase is $8.5M, with a potential contract value of approximately $250M over all 4 phases. Palantir was awarded a Phase 1 Project Agreement through an Other Transaction Agreement with Consortium Management Group on behalf of Consortium for Command, Control and Communications in Cyberspace. During the first phase of the effort, Palantir will collaborate with the Army to design and demonstrate the ground station prototype solution for the Army's TITAN program. The Palantir solution will leverage space, high altitude, aerial, terrestrial sensors and data sources for use in intelligence and military targeting operations. It will field a "turn key" solution for the Army that integrates data from a variety of sources including commercial and classified sources from space to ground sensors. The results of the first phase of this competitive contract will be used by the Army to inform awarding of future phases and eventual production of the ground station for the TITAN enterprise.Citi downgrade and new contract = double downgrade 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡That's it selling apple and buying more GME.Tim Apple is a cuckI hate aapl.

The objective is to determine if a stock is red or green currently. My logic is if current price - previous close = + then green. And vice versa. 

Only thing is it has to keep updating closing price at end of each day. Is there a better way?

Tim, if you want to tackle systemic racism, good for you (honestly), but do so with your own fucking fortune.

Apple Launches Major New Racial Equity and Justice Initiative Projects to Challenge Systemic Racism, Advance Racial Equity Nationwide

1/13/21, 1:00 PMJust a heads up in Canada here they just released projected covid numbers factoring in the new strain. We only have a couple of cases so far. They are saying it's a matter of when not if it takes hold. Projecting possibly double infection rates within two weeks up to 20x in the near future at the current rates. My guess is we are doing a bit better than the US? Don't know what your government is telling you but if trends continue shit is gonna go full lock down. They just put 8pm curfew in one province and only leaving house for food and the Dr. in my province. Busting people left and right for violations. Shit is gonna get very bad for a few months. Buckle up. Puts on old people. Hospitals will get wrecked.$1,000 a day for 70 years is $25 million.

Edit: I mean if I a person had $25 million, he can spend $1,000 a day for 25 yearsFuckin MM hitjob motherfuckersThere's a reason Citi rhymes with shitty$GOEV open 20 and riding to $24 at 9:50It's actually pretty sick how fast the EV industry is growing.

Seeing that short seller engage with the CEO on twitter and the CEO's behavior, it definitely seems like Trevor Milton type fraudster behavior. The CEO deleted a few tweets in his engage with @PlainSite but PlainSite was asking questions and asking him why he didn't disclose cases against him with investors, and other questions about  issues with his past businesses and the CEO just threatens to sue him. Also the CEO seems obsessed with stock price and tweets about it. Red flags..INTC up 8% premarket on reports their CEO is stepping down

- BeckyThe past few days it's been getting in my head that I should
sell ~5% of my TSLA position.

E.g. sell $25,000 today.  TSLA will continue to go up, perhaps
to $1000+ during this year.

Next January, sell another $25,000.  TSLA will crash mid-year.
But if it doesn't, then the next January sell another $25,000, etc.

The TSLA rise may continue for another 3 or 5 years, who knows,
but it's been 13 years since a recession.  There's got to be one,
5 years from now tops.

I don't like doing a lot of little transactions, but this seems to
me the best way.

I don't like taking the tax hit, letting it ride is much safer,
but I'm just starting to feel antsy.  (Of course, last time I felt
antsy I sold a boatload of TSLA at $890 pre-split.)

Also, my kids are having some issues and it's looking like
child care costs are going to triple for two of our kids.  Starting
to feel the pinch for cash again.Ill remind you. The 1918 Spanish flu was caused by *influenza*. 

Influenza is not a coronavirus. *No one acutally knows how long it takes for a coronavirus to reach its seasonal form.*

The Q3 numbers fubo reported (58% paid subscriber increase and 71% surge in revenue) were impressive, and the Q4 preliminary report shows a surprisingly strong increase in both metrics. The strategic acquisitions of Balto and Vigtory increase fubo’s competitiveness, and they will release a sports book app by the end of the year. The legal allegations against fubo seem to be without merit, and the stock has shot up over 34% in a day in spite of the allegations, so that should be telling.

---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give optimistic guidance for 2021 (due to a vaccine being available and an actual competent administration). However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. 

Have a nice day and make a lot of teddies today!

P.S.
The most liquid strike and expiration is $35c June. But looking at how it's moving even before earning season, i think even the $40c June will be ITM and print bigly before June.

I like buying at open and selling before 10am, need some ideas.The recent volatility is due to political news. Meanwhile, companies are still making money regardless of what is happening in politics. The market is waiting on any hint of good news, in this case, a direction. After the inauguration, the volatility will settle down and the market continues as usual. Big tech earnings coming up.

Sent from my iPhoneBro you’re absolutely right.  

Drop $100M- of which $75M will be spent on an architect to design and build the Apple store of education- or give Detroit actual long term jobs?

AAPL was better off not announcing anything.can't stop, won't stopPltr down rating.. don’t buy yetThey’re pandering to the poor who just got $600Its actually brilliant... announce this weeks before that 1400$ gets deposited in all the poor peoples accountsThis is the truthIt’s a luxury product. These investments in communities are a net positiveThe only color these company's care about, is GREEN.I will remember this post a year from now and look back on the good times

!Remindme 1 yearMy calls are fuckedI wish this was true 🙏🙏You can’t short apple anymore that’s racisthttps://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-launches-major-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-projects-to-challenge-systemic-racism-advance-racial-equity-nationwide/What happened?NopeI had the Booker T 

*Tell me he didnt say that* reactionyup 😂depends on the industry... in equities research its more senior. If you're the firm's internet analyst that means you'll have associates and senior associates etc. reporting to you gathering data etc. you could be 40 and be an analyst there making 500k /yrOrders in for 50, 75, and 150. SQUEEZE ME JIMHe talked about BBBY shorters the other day, high chance of it happeningIt's still pre split, bro.same bro. but no point in agonizing over the past, you'd be able to make up the hypothetical gains you could have made in TSLA in the stonks that are like sleeping giants rn. get back in when it inevitably splits soonEvery contract means they need to hire more engineers which means losing more money... something they've been doing every year since coming into existence.

They need an improved business model that improves scalability, not more contracts.Alexa play the carpenters - it's only just begunWas barely aware at that time, but really this doesn’t compare. 

When you watch the Super Bowl this year it’s not gonna be 50% ads for green energy companies.FCEL and PLUG burnt me back then.

I’ll buy those shares. Not your FD’s.Sell covered calls near the money and make more tendiesSameShort squeeze. Look at what happened to QS over the last month. If you got out with profits your are good. There's going to be some bag holders very soonSure hope not.TSLA is less than 10% of my portfolio now, not just saying this cause I own a couple calls. But you’re like the 100th person that has spoken too soon. I’ve seen pre market be down 10% then up 10% by open, but also vice versa. Not tryna talk shit, just be careful when using after hours data to make decisions for yourself. It seems to not be a good indicator for what’s going to happen when market actually opens. Literally 2 hours ago it was over 860. What’s to say in 2 hours it won’t jump back?I bought a Put. RIP meI have 865 and even that’s gonna be worthlessGOEV puts?Does it have pop-ups?PLTR to the moonWait and see it’s movement firstBut whyI’m here for this.

$12C for Jan 22.When I first started investing I bought a bunch of F because "the dividends are good" and "it's a reliable company." I have never had an invest slowly bleed out like they did. Fuck that boomer shit7c 1/22 couple weeks ago paid less the 100 on iv was about 3is super cheapI’m more unnerved by the fact that zucc tried to help humanity 👹Cory Booker got rich!_heroic Kendall Jenner noises_Think it was more CBS that hyped itDude just played the smartest move of the year. What a better time to get on the side of those transitioning into power than now. This will help them with the Biden administration and makes them a positive company siding with the Dems.

Bigger picture play here.So calls?No this is the place$15.It’s easy to 💎🙌 when it’s not real money 🤷‍♂️> Remember boys. If PLUG dips, you buy. Just like TSLA.

Very coincidentally indeed.If you've identified the pattern, why aren't you profitting?iPhones don’t make themselvesYeah this was the high IQ play to align themselves with the new wave of blue in control. I’m all for it.What they do?No one for one second believes AAPL is a right wing company.Maybe but why the fuck would they just not drop it out of the blue instead of saying "big announcement tomorrow" and shooting their stock in the footHoly cockFront page worthy frThats a 5 bagger minimum.Same, can’t remember the last time Tesla underperform compared to spyA while? Like 3 days?Time to bring that shit up againCiti downgrade to sellWhat happened ?IFKR>can someone less lazy than me look into it please thanks

They’re my favorite of those 3. Someone hacked into my Uber ears account and spent $400 on food in California a few hours after I ordered food on the east coast so I copped the dashpass and have been pretty happy since.

The stock targets that really get things moving are from the hedge funds. Check TSLA stock on the day it’s target price rose to 850.

It's not Tesla but wtf other company moves like they do. People playing Tesla is gonna create a generation of super autistic gamblers who expect abnormal daily returns...Because it means it will move sideways or down a cliff and our retarded earning calls will keep bleedingBecause the incel losers here that have nowhere else on the internet that allows them to act like the backwards ass douches they are feel the need to reeeeeeeThis announcement gonna be major retarded.Which means they are smart.

Are you thinking a day trade or buying for a future expiration date?Hmm I got some, are u telling me I still have a chance?Rumor of apple car turned out to be anti racism announcement. Hype kind of dead.there was a lot of volume on 1/15 20c back on 12/28 (when i bought them) and even more volume on 1/11. not sure what that means when it comes to resistance or profit taking at ~$20It was reported that aapl had talks with them in beginning of this year for acquisition. They just wanted investment and the deal feel through. That news was enough to send it to the moon AH.GOEV still under valued, CES today...and if apples talking to you, you clearly got something good.Lmaoo maybe next weekHave a 1/22c $3500 queued up to hopefully fill at $3.80 at open 🤞it's up pre while nas is down but tech being down will drag it down too unfortunately for my $30,000 call.GMEPlug plzBLPDI stopped holding through ERs, even solid ones like this

There’s still tendies on the table LYFT ftw!They just want in. Hold.Nobody tell himYeahhh that’s pretty much already the case chiefGOEV has discussions with Apple and they went nowhere.

I even have applied exponential by ins.

TLDR; If you have the money now invest it now. Period.

Add things you earn on the way on the dips.and thus you became a boomerWhen’s he supposed to appear before our eyes?I was one of those cucks.

Bow to your government overlords.  CanadiacucksI will suck your cock if it goes to $24Idk if my dick could handle thatPersonally I hope it dips to 19.99 and stays there until next Monday 

Sold some calls to try to dump my stock, but then I actually did research (back when the stock was still 15-16, and decided I might want to hold onto it

Of course I couldn't close out my sold calls yesterday due to my phone bricking 🙄Most of them do it for the show with no logic behindThis is the way. However, appealing the SJW demographic will boost sales since they're easily exploitable. Take their money and put it straight into my pocket💯BanLmaoWow I get banned for quoting section 230, and this idiot doesn’t get banned for politics?

He is a value investor, not a trader, so he looks at stocks he is happy to own for years. I am personally bullish on BABA but I think it's going to hit 200 before it starts climbing again. When it starts showing signs of recovery I'm going to buy some for a long-term hold.Potential upside is also HUGE if jack ma is found, baba no longer delisted, and earnings good and get PT upgrades. Imagine all 3 happen, how you’d sky rocket to 300+ and this could all happen within monthsBABA held 220 bottom firmly after delisting news, doubt its going lower. Earnings in 2-3 weeks, should be huge. Can’t het delisted lol all major investors are USA funds. Biden replacing trump should help too, feels like silence before the storm.What he’s saying is IV crush is going to change deltas of OTM calls (lower) and subsequently the dealers will have to sell stock to stay delta neutral.

They can’t just sell their stock in the company because that can collapse the price as well as give up control.  They usually try and announce the the price is surging as to keep a stabilized price. If you sell when it’s down you
Can destabilize your stock as well.Doesn't it mean that the company needs cash?They’re  selling shares to generate income so their earnings report isn’t dog shit, yes they believe they’re price is high and they’re trying to profit from itI know morning about LMND. Could be that, or an indication that they need more cash for either growth or to stay afloatCould indicate either high price (ZM) or they are desperate for capital (GME)One of many reasons, alot of it has to do with raising capital for whatever the company needs.Yes.

It is not about a conspiracy to restrain trade. Instead, this case is about Parler’s demonstrated unwillingness and inability to remove from the servers of Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) content that threatens the public safety, such as by inciting and planning the rape, torture, and assassination of named public officials and private citizens. There is no legal basis in AWS’s customer agreements or otherwise to compel AWS to host content of this nature. AWS notified Parler repeatedly that its content violated the parties’ agreement, requested removal, and reviewed Parler’s plan to address the problem, only to determine that Parler was both unwilling and unable to do so. AWS suspended Parler’s account as a last resort to prevent further access to such content, including plans for violence to disrupt the impending Presidential transition.

>Despite Parler’s rhetoric, its lawsuit is no more than a meritless claim for breach of contract. But the facts are unequivocal: If there is any breach, it is Parler’s demonstrated failure and inability to identify and remove such content. AWS was well within its rights to suspend Parler immediately for those failures. Parler also cannot hold AWS liable in tort for enforcing the agreement’s express terms. And there is no antitrust claim where, as here, Parler cannot plausibly plead an agreement to cause it harm and the complained-of conduct is undeniably compatible with a legitimate purpose. Compelling AWS to host content that plans, encourages, and incites violence would be unprecedented. Parler has no likelihood of prevailing on the merits, and the balance of equities and public interest strongly tip against an injunction. The motion for a temporary restraining order should be denied.One of Amazon’s lawyers probably makes more than everyone at parlor combined. FINTC bullish.

It is just armchair financial experts (that being said I have been guilty of feeling like I know a lot, but lets be honest we wouldn't be here if we were experts).Man one guys comments that said that same shit about him owning land - its def made up. He claims he is making 150% returns a quarter on his stock picks.... oh and he also puts 10% of his money into CDs and funds.

This guys is saying he routinely picks stocks that return 150% in a quarter... every timeFucking bullshitThe real pro tips always in the commentsCan you retire now?The number is still too small to jerk it to on my accountNYC, where I liveTo get the apartment I'd need to turn my current RH portfolio 20x lol.

I calculated this because it closed at 378.77, and S is the 19th letter, P is the 16th, and Y is the 25th. And when you add those 3 together it’s a combination of 60 which I added to calculate my price target upgrade.

Caused me a lot of stressYeah it’s a stupid war stock and you morons keep destroying your accounts on itLmao I’m just joking man 

I peeped the chart. Hopefully you’re in the green by now. 

I’m just saying it seems really risky when you could get the same return on a much less risky play. 

I honestly hope it turns out well for you! 🙏🏾“Bloding - A Black’s Only Coding Course Taught By Tupac’s Hologram, Register Now!”Your white hood is hanging out of your back pack bud.Google.com

It's funny more than anything imma short this trash laterEven with the downgrade, I think that's a good move.  Most investors know analysts and their PT's are a joke in the current market.  BTFD; I will be.Lol these fuckers just hate PLTR, I bet it's still gonna go up. Bull cycle is commencing.Yeah but they raised the PT. Always blows my mind when they do that shit.PLTR got beat down by Citron then by Morgan Stanley then by Credit Suisse, but slowly it's getting stronger and punching back. Citi's downgrade will only affect PM.That’s fucking geniusYup. And I don’t even post nudes or porn. Just shirtless pictures that can be found on my Instagram 😄What about his a guy?I'm not sure we have had a public official also break the norm of the big sex issue. No politician outside of the actors kennedy's has every really gotten as wild and crazy. You have to understand though that back them everyone got news from the papers and the 5-0Clock news or the 10pm news. We are in a day and age where nearly every person has a phone that is equivalent to, OR GREATER then the ibm systems used to land us on the moon. We have leaped and bounded over tech hurdles like we are olympic sprinters. Sure we have our setbacks but we have ultimately grown as a society so quickly through tech we don't see it anymore. Wrap you head around some of those ideas and get back to me. 

I just remember NC-17 RATINS AND not knowing anyone that could buy them for me. When now that level and a 1000's mor e is FREELY out there.

We have moved into a new age/era/whatever you want to call it. Tech has changed everything and we still think in PG-13 STANDARDS. That alone should show you how far behind we are.NIO is literally the example OP looking for. 

That ship sailed.Would you mind breaking down the leaps process for me? I’ve only had my fair share of success in the market buying weeklies/selling puts. Would certainly like to learn about leaps and how the returns work.Yeah sucks , that thing could of been running like a hype machineWon't they release earnings at the end of February, like 21 - 23 or so?I'm in EU, trading options on US stocks isn't just a push of a buttonIt’s a diversity initiative.

So it is going to happen?Are you sure it wasn’t just me three times?Think it may piggyback?Honestly, probably a decent idea. If you’ve have your day trade safety net just get FD’s.It's been green and in a V-shaped recovery for a week bro, coming back from the typical post-merger dump.Source?This is the way.That’s what I’m thinking. Thanks, my dude.I don’t think I’m gonna look a gift horse in the mouth. If this holds through premarket I’m just gonna ship it. I’m already up huge so I don’t think it’s worth the risk.True but I’ve found the regret from gains lost through holding too long hurts me way worse than missing on an extra jump.Username checks outThey will if ol zuck won’t get in line and rig her election too 🤣Aw man, can I get an early morning break?

Edit: also to the comment belowWhy do you even try to reason with them bruh...Seriously? It still hasnt even surpassed its ATH back in early 2020 when it spiked over 900 briefly for two days.😂😂All that butt action really got you heated huhI did. I am in actuality a very serious and intelligent person!!!!!+1, really like the streetsmartedge platform.heard some stocks weren't available on rh and wanted to move up a little. i didn't think i'd be able to make this much money off of trading, so hitting 5k is a good indicator for whether or not i'm serious about this. it's more of a personal thing, and i'm looking to fund my way through grad school with my gains and hold stocks until i die. 

i just got the vibe that rh is like entry level. i've got a good 2k to go before i got 5k, so i'll see how things look for me tbh.thank you bro this actually was some pretty good insight. do you trade options at a high volume? and how much would you actually keep in your rh account at one time? i'm scared of not being able to transfer out my gains or some shit lolThat news has been going all week.   Futures were green at 5am. Now I checked and it's redAgree lol

Its too stupid a play, even for wsbfed printing tho ?Lmao not anymoreStripeNo doubt it will hit 30 at some point. Just going to be a slow frustrating climb, I believe.  To many waiting for it to go parabolic and It just doesn’t seem like that’s going to happen .Wow 🙄Hey it's 5 percent, now I'm switching it to some safe dividend stocks and get paid quarterly to watch you guys draw red lines.Lmao I know 😂😂It’s not sexy but probably a good callYeah idk either I listen to these people too muchAt least you're honestJust buy some Tesla and ICLN and wait until you make your money back :)Yea they are making a school for kids to demo their products under the name racial equality, I mean they already have asian children making them so branch out a little.dude i fucking knew that vid somebody posted of him flying through a city on a parachute a couple days ago was legit 

thanksThxNo you

PLTR to the marsNo that racism has endedWell they might slowly tread into profitability which will make them a decent company but if they can't hyperscale then don't expect the stock price to go up much from here.Yeah at the core it’s absolutely just a PR thing. Democratic administration, which is generally tougher on tech, favors minorities. People need to connect the dots moreLmao I hear ya man, it would be super. Expect breadcrumbs throughout the year 😞I doubt MARA hits 1300Awesome dude 🤙I agree completely. Fuel cell tech is the future. And they are well established. Plug is not qs. Plug might be tsla.I don’t blame you. But I’m always going to hold at least a small position until it pops. Hate to miss out on the crazy unrealistic gainsGood luck bro, sincerely. 👍🏽That’s not even exciting movement though 😔you're describing a meme like it's a memeMid February I thinkLord help usBrb gonna go get you some calculations. Rough, but probably within 90% accuracyYeah your probably looking at 6k profit selling at open at current pm price.It went up for the first time, AH for fucks sake, and everyone panicking PM the following day. I’ve literally never seen anything like it. 🤪cant have time decay if there's no time left!If you got the balls then go for it. Feb is the safer option.Yeah shits weird though with the public posts and stuff. Like the tard that commented on your post lol 

And they make it so hard to link direct images.ShittygroupI don’t even know what that means but I’m all inLol fair enough, it be like that.I don't really get out of here much anymore but thought I'd take a look into it and saw some dude post about his $1 a day dividend, it was then that I realised those guys are even more retarded than us but don't even realise itHe’s literally the guy who just jerked off & tells everybody he smashed Becky Quick...nobody believes you broMaybe in the next <4 years, we’ll see. Conversely, I could also go bankrupt. So there’s thatGotcha. Aren’t they called condos tho?
And we don't have a stock analytics business to bankrupt with bogus and unrealised $20 puts 😎I'll be happy at $30. Probably jump out. PT is only $31solid DDBut it's definitely a long term hold1/2022 leaps...That is fucked upIght, imma go all in calls in DASHThey sell xboxs so they got that atleastFrom my limited research, it seems like they will be a large player in the smart home and smart car revolution (because come on, we've known for 50 years that technology will progress us to the Jetsons level)

Even their website is entirely different than I expected, I was very impressed with the substantial changes they've made to their company (at least on the surface level)

Also, peep the deal they have with Canoo (GOEV) to design their ADAS for the smart cars, and GOEV has connections to Hyundai, which has connections to AAPL...I'm not tbh. I think this a good play. Might even dig out my old BB phone.100 million into racial justiceBlack lives matterAnti racism virtue signaling basicallyI hope you didn’t buy Friday. If you did that’s a huge rip. It’s looking like it’ll go flat or up today. Best of luck to you!Exactly. I can’t even defend this as a progressive .wonder who that could beGot it, loading up to the titsAh more, more stimmy! Perfect!I have ACI and KR in my long term.It's not illegal to be in both, homie.I made some money of a few swing trades in October but maybe it’s time to get back to basics.I mean they are still tech and tech has been on a bad run of dumping after earnings but this intel news could be a great catalyst.I feel ya. Sorry bro bro hopefully the market sees this too at openBut it's still down premarket.... :( I need to see a 27$+++ brake to sleep well again...Lol...this thing went up 100$ in a week..5$ is nothingi have a lot in shares and a 6/18 122.96 call. I'm not even close to being ready to sell that yet. Up 60%.ICLNLol I’ve been holding ICLN for a long time too but I’m not really qualified to give advice. I just thought ahead to what industries would do well with a Democrat in charge and got lucky to choose some winnersIt's split, retard. The majority is 11 seats in the House and the VP is the tie breaker in the Senate. Manchin and the other moderates are the power brokers. The Green New Deal and whatever else are dead on arrival.I’ve got 855 1/15’s

Pray for us.It’s just gunna do that thing where I sell and then on the day my calls would have expired, skyrocket.Ya 2020 was fun but that’s the pastRSI on the 10 and 20 day chart is bonkers. Been above 70 for virtually the last week. It literally cannot sustain this, one because it’s not TSLA, and two because they lose money. I expect this to be in mid 180s today.They did a direct offering, not an ipoPeople did not expect this kind of announcement (because they have unhealthy expectations) in my opinion and for this trading day I think the announcement won't move the stock price up.I think more of sideway action, but don't take my word on it.Never selling shares babyyy. Also if you think a war isn't coming to lift countries out of the recession you are seriously retarded btw.Nah, you’re just a retardI might have to bail out of this company with all this woke bullshit unless it brings in extra profitshttps://imgur.com/gallery/V6iAYtX

860Nice!!! Leaps are cheap right now!!They can say whatever they want.

But when the “joke” falls flat and people want to cancel these people, they aren’t allowed to get upset.

His tweet is saying that he wishing he could say derogatory things towards groups of people without getting any backlash for it.If it hits 30 I’ll probably sell half, I’m a pussyEh I don’t see them getting back to where they were since the big company’s are making their own chips or using amd nowLmao I been im a god damn MexicanPlease please please set a reminder hahaahhaAll on black!God speedno but his cheerleaders are.Yeah just casually shorting the bubble of clean energy.

Gay guys pay you for that?leaps are just long calls. ICLN has calls for sale that expire January 2022. Theta not great rn but ITM positions seem like guaranteed cash, just gotta sit on it for awhile since it's an ETF.This why my portfolio is still full of NIO. Thinking it still has the possibility to run up in the short term.Yeah its a little over a month away I believesrry to hear thatFfs.Kind of glad it jumped like this.  Cheaper puts for a year outI bought 2022 putsWhatWhatWhatYeah what is the tickerYes I don’t normally hold longer than a day, sometimes even day trade. Longest I think I held was 2 days onceYup and it’s cheap af. I’ll always be bullish on cyber security.I like it, that was the exact position I was looking at as well. Will buy at open today.lolzDidn’t realize you were saying Bank of America. First glance just thought you were aiming to claim bofa these nuts set the target to 900Yes.It’s been beat up not a long term hold but it’s definitely going to have a run up before earnings 🤷🏽‍♂️Bullish?OuchSame, my whole account is almost tied up now. I’m in SPY, ARKG, ARKK, AMD, NVDA, SQ. Figured most of them had enough of a dip to get in, just need to wait for the recovery now and hope there’s not some crazy correctionYour profit will be 

Premium + (strike price x 100)Thanks22.5 i think, maybe 25 don't remember. biden is talking thursday to tell us abou this stimmyplan. also he will speak on inauguration speech and will talk about clean energy so both are bullishWhen has Cathie ever failed us? 🥰You should look at a chart.Check out their last earnings callHahaha, you can dm me if you want, I listened to you about Mgm and it was good 🥺Fair enough.oh so you make the rules now ?It's definitely a long hold, I also bought tons more Monday when it opened -25%Lol.  What a legend.Since 5am 😎I’m building a startup, and sneaking in 2 hrs of trading...Might not even be enough when they start buying the dip it’ll hit ATH by Friday2/19Cross your fingers and hope Biden helps you out tomorrow.APHA/TLRY these 2 companies are merging 

CGC
CRLBF
CCHWF
GTBIF
MSOS

These are just a few, but I would wait to get in. I feel
They will consolidate in the next few weeks. Now APHA/TLRY merger is supposed close in Q2 March/April tike frame. This will create largest Cannabis company in the world. They have a deal with Anheuser Busch INV (BUD).Big established Canadian companies that are going to absolutely devour the patchwork of state business once US goes federally legal. 

EV, weed, stable government. Look at me. Democrats are money now. Thanks Buyden very cool.*Monkey's paw curls.*You musta bought stupid ass callsThey had a public offering not too long ago, which usually means down - but like TSLA did BLNK shot up on they’re public offering, they went from 41-50; profit taking one day and now they are set to take off againno they're afraid Fed will change interest rates based in rising inflationI too wonder about this contradiction every time it gets raised.Damn... in comparison they are just damn near free.WestI’m a retard too but I don’t think thats how it works, if you sell OTM call, you have to buy back to close the position. 

Say you sold a $30 call for $0.25, while the price is $20. Say the price rose to $29 bringing the option closer to the money, because you’re short the $30 call to close you’d buy that contract back. In this scenario, you’d buy back for $1.00 for a loss of $0.75. 

Id look at credit spreads.Stay strong brother sending love, i only do shares now been burned too many timesIn that case then goev

Apple already passed up on them and that says somethingThat’s in the sequel!3 hours ago

At this point this is making one half of a disgruntled populace the equivalent of second class citizens. Also, mods pls banMonitor it and arrest them. You're dumb as a brick.thanks!the fuck this has to do with canoo?fuck me with a strap onI'm sure, I use RES to tag people and all three times it was an untagged person, unless you're using multiple accounts.Bigly regarded.Pretty much. Also, Jim Cramer is now on the case. Boomers have entered the chat.I don’t care enough to check his commentsmmm i had really good luck with tsla 1 dte in the last two weeks but i also took my  cues from big whales buying  those calls. PLUG might also pull back before the 3 day weekend. I have one weekly left on that and will probably roll it out and look for $100 out several months. FCEL same. ( G E V O same space has been running but no options).Can’t tell if you’re being serious but if so you’re gonna die so you should probably do something about it. I was in a similar but not nearly as bad situation as yours and went back to therapy and that helped a lot. Maybe think about doing the same thing.You should read more on what you invest in so you know why it’s a good investment. I watched people buy buy buy and then panic all in 12 hours while the market wasn’t even open. It’s extremely telling of people’s intelligence. Doesn’t matter, I read. GOEV will be everywhere in 5 years.I don’t see it?Mara is solid as long as corn is above 27k.Should have put “ “ around it. 😂I dunno, I'm bored🧐I have a bridge to sell you.I don't know what that has to do with anything.😂 I didn't get enough butt action 🥺All the best with it! Big props for starting so early.yea i have calls only on 4 stocks, all high volume. i put 30k total into my robinhood and am not gonna add any more. and don’t worry about that, robinhood has its flaws but if you have nice gains and wanna transfer them to your bank account or to your schwab account you’ll be fine (if you wanna transfer positions to schwab you’ll have to pay a fee of 75 bucks, transferring cash is no fee though)I’m just saying...that’s a pretty good reason to be red lmaoHe “bought the dip”I’m sorry you’re holding so many bags you have to lie like that

I know the people at Stripe and they say hi but not a chance in hellStripe is a 50B co. No fucking way they get SPACd.Lmao my bad, I wasn’t sure if I made that clear or not from the original postOne of my only qualitiesYea I’ve got a 3x long Tesla ETF currently bleeding me dry because of course I bought the day before NIO day. Holding it long term thoughLmfaoPLTR is dead and downgraded. Go check our Cramers Twitter. He’s gonna pump GMEAnd you good sir!Am unloading my leaps today on this piece of junk..... and buy back only during then I guessDidn’t even notice he commented lmao. Yeah, it’s weird that they have their own community.man - I guarantee the same people posting on those subs are the ones posting on this one at my work. I swear its that weird group that just do it to try and one up each other and humble brag. its fucking bizarreYeah there are condos here. I'm not from here tho so i just use the terminology i'm familiar withTo be fair 1/22 is so next Friday. Easy mistake.at first glance, yes...if you're an apple investor it's brilliantProof or gtfoI actually quite like my Xbox tbhI wanna know who was the dumbass that hyped up this bullshitWow how stupidOh shit I thought you were ragging from when I posted that ACI was a good buy-in right now haha. Glad to see someone else sees long term potential for it.Definitely not holding through ERyeah lets create a prayer circle for the stimmy talks tomorrow to send TSLA to the moonOrder book is completely manipulated. The float and trade volume is tiny so it’s super easy to move the price. Most of this run has been short squeeze.True but doesn’t change the point as the banks still get approximately the same cutSome were thinking it’d be a vaccination announcement.

So it may move up just because they aren’t passing out free vaccines at their stores. 🤷‍♂️

But not a price moving announcement.Cool story broFound TrumpTV’s first customer[deleted]But that's not what it closed at like you said...What do you think about $30 1/21/2022 

Only $201 each....

Part of me even thinks that’s not being greedy enough due to the merger and if any sort of legalization happens I think it’ll truly fly

Canadas legalization soared it to $300 somehow in 2018Bro it literally says legalize comedy it ain’t the deepBecause of that it'll hit 40 EOW 😂All on green. Cuz I have ballswell when ya don't short by calling the top yeah it's pretty easy

You wait for the bulls to break down firstIndeed. A dude paid me probably $200 by himself just to send selfies in my boxer briefs 😁Ahh got it 👍thank you for taking the time to help and have a great week aheadYeah I’m not too sure right now . Guess will see next few days. Makes me mad Xpev and LI pumped so hard yesterday and we fell redOk, thanks.By feb 19 puts on feb 5 and then the same dates in mayThere’s a SPAC etc#THERES A SPAC ETFS P C XSPAKGMEOuch?Gotcha, thanks. You think it's still worth buying calls at open today?What would I see?I'm very aware of the shelf offering. On the call they said they have no intentions of using it, only if its a dire situation.ok callout will be in Vegas first to make sure that shit ignites.we are the captain nowOh fuck off. There are 20 comments saying the same thing, go cry elsewhere.I got MARA and NIO stocked long, aiming for Pluto, just gotta buy the diphell ya. big gains incomingDon't forget to tip us off insider style when your startup makes an agreement to go public via SPACI’m not even trading ICLN. RH shows calls down on a 1%+ yesterdaylooks like a cup and handle on the daily.. handle hasn’t formed yet. potential downward before breakoutOhh but there is no way they fed would raise rates right now. That would be insaneYou have to weigh the risks too[deleted][deleted]Nothing that’s why there’s a sell off right nowNot for this sub, no. But then I’d have to assume that means the momentum is on big NGA. 

Assume means hope, right?BRING ON THE STRONG VHe deffo FOMOed at the topYeah it's a tough call. We've been range-bound for ages now. Who knows what will happen once insiders can sell at will. I think institutions will snap the shares up tho.It's just depressing seeing people bragging about their shit investments thinking they're some sort of fucking genius when if they'd YOLO'd into TSLA they could have probably quadrupled their investment 😂Right lol.. ‘round here you rent apartments, buy condos / townhouses etc.. where do you “buy” apartments?Ah! Sorry man. Not trying to blast yah over it.I’m in, but I wasn’t planning on holding into tomorrow.That’s not wokeYou don’t understand what woke means. Or you are trolling. Either way you’ll find out soon enough when Wakanda starts to control everything.There’s no doubt at all that it will fly if it gets legalized. That’s the part that we’re gambling with. No legs no jump, and probably just a steady decline forever. 

Personally I’m doing $15 1/21/22

More expensive, little safer, but also let’s me cash out for profits easier in the short term if I’m wanting access to more money for some reasonI’m not even going deep!

Its a cancel culture reference. Probably more specifically to the pronoun memes he sent out.Not complaining as the other half of my portfolio exists out of XPEV 😅 but it sucks after the great announcements that they have made on NIO day, which for me was higher than my anticipation.Spac elfOh my god we’re all billionairesMy shares of MARANo idea. I'm not putting any more into this one personally. Might still go up though its a relatively small cap co.Oh lovely, I’ll dm ya real quickWhy i get da bootyou're the one crying fuckin retard. go back and read your cry baby comments. you big fuckin cry baby baby. WAHHH I MAKE BAD DECISIONS WAHHHHHH WHAHHHHH WAHHHHHHREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELol !  But actually a good idea to let this group of geniuses & retards knowOne of the holdings did poorly, 1% is nothing on options when I tripled my account last week YOLOing on themOh nvm crayons do whatever you do broYou sure proved me wrong bud, great comeback and everything.

Back to twitter cupcake :xPeople making credible threats of violence is an arrestable offence. And no, you're right, we definitely do not have the technology to track people down from their Internet activity.

Fuck me you're dense. You truly belong here.No it just means NGA holders are kind of desperate for retail buys rather than having news that adds momentum/excitement without spam begging on another ticker.Do you think the leaps is worth holding? I got in at $8 for a 2023 45C. 

They keep getting good news n new contract but keeps getting downgraded wtfI grew up in Japan, where you buy apartmentsDidn’t think you were lol. I wasn’t trying to grief you either. I just actually reviews a bunch of ICLN holding and was like damn. Less of a US etf then I thought. I think a lot of people are expecting a huge pump on ICLN in the coming days. I would love that, but I think it will be more subtle[deleted][deleted]What’s that?dunno>reeeeeeeeethat’s not what I’m saying. April calls up only 2% when icln up 1% eodMy gut says hold. But ngl, the downgrades make me think shit i dunno.Right. The amount of people who jumped into this play have zero understanding of what a ETF is and how it works. Well get a pump but in reality I’m expecting this to be at 60-70 by 2022. Using this has my main investment while I roll FDs on meme stocksWoke is social justice warrior/racial equity bullshit not being mad your guy didn’t win the electionMmmmmk simp.There’s a SPAC elfThanks buddy I think imma hold and average down. Long term outlook for this company does look q juicy though but idk man.... this is insane.... would they ever go up....!What?
