That is all.PLTR is ruining my reputation as a WSB traderICLN paper hands morons in shamblesBiggest lesson from 2020: if the company makes money, stay the fuck away from itTim Cook today announced that he can't be racist because he in fact has a black friend.PLTR was finally breaking out and was looking good till Demo Day and of course some cucktard analyst comes in with a downgrade to tank this shit so they can buy in. Absolute fucking BS. Wait till the rest of WSB wakes up and sees the downgrade....we buying the fucking dipMy favorite pre market activity is watching AAPL be up 1% and watching it bleed all the way down to red by open.PLTR finally started looking good and now this.Citi just wiped out all these PLTR 30c holdersBlack airpodsOh wow Apple investing $25 million in Detroit? That’s the huge announcement???

i dont know about you fellas, but this makes perfect sense considering I buy a new flatscreen tv every week while I only buy food once every 5 years.Just read the “big announcement” by Tim Apple and I am lost for words. A private corporation that produces all of its products in sweatshops in Asia wants to educate people on social injustice. America is truly in the middle age😂ICLN goin up today?At this point I wish AAPL would dump another U2 album on us...Tesla giving such a good fight in the pre market, let’s hope for 880-900 EODTSLA price target is 900. we'll be hitting resistance on the way. godspeed ladies and gentlemen.I hope GME rips through $24.

Racial Justice project? Fuck you Tim. 

Tell me more about racial injustice why you use slave labor you giant cuck hypocrite.Citi is worse than CitronDaddy Karp should get on twitter so he can reverse uno card all these ghey downgradersCiti is against retards. PLTR NIODear citi,

You use word “downgrade”, yet you increase PT. I do not think you know what word meansICLN is doing the thingyAAPL is gonna be red by open and my calls will be fucked.I think APPLE made a mistake, people that care about racism know that is a poor atempt to wash their image as one of the biggest corporations that represents capitalism as It's worst, so they will not care about this program and at the same time they are moving away from part of the customers. Bad and expensive advertasing campaing in my opinion. On the other hand I am just an Europoor that bought PLTR 2 days ago so not the best one to give financial adviceCramer on team GME now 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀the market must be racistTim slept with a black dude and he comes out with a $100million initiativePalantearsAlright racism is canceled this year.

Apple doesn’t ever share ANYTHING until close to launch, why would that change now, especially considering the EV would be the biggest announcement they’ve made since iPhone? Do you really think Timmy would just pop up on morning talk show to drop that shit with no presentation or keynote?Upgrade SNOW, which has had absolutely 0 news but downgrade PLTR. Makes sense.

The. i checked GMEAny time PLTR goes on a run for a few days someone comes in to swat it back down. It’s complete bullshit.Fuck this, Citi downgraded PLTR because it “may lose its shine in 2021”. How do you downgrade to sell on a hunch, this is a jokeFuck AAPL. I’m going to lose so much money on calls. All they had to do was go up $10 in 3 months and I would have made money.I made my daughter say a prayer for TSLA before I dropped her off for kindergarten. You can thank me later.Citi just downgraded PLTR to sell. RIPPLTR could cure cancer and analysts would still downgrade its stock value to $10 🙄Hey this is Tim Cook we haven’t done anything innovative in 5 years so here’s some money black pplI'm such a greedy fucker. The longer I spend here the more greedy I become. Suddnely increasing my account by 40% in a year is not good enough. I need to at least 2x it and better is 10x it this year. And even then I still need to get multples on it maybe next year to reach my net worth goals that will allow me to buy an apartment. 

I spent several hours on Zillow over the weekend and picked out a bunch of 1M+ apartments to shoot for. 

I know this is completely delusional but I also have nothing else to do with my spare time and its so fun and addicting.pltr downgraded again wtf. is instant red on downgrade. bleeds slowly on upgrade.PLTR fought against citi... buying calls in the morningBears: call an ambulance, but not for me 🔫Hey Tim, do the lives of uighers matter to you?

Palantir announced the Army down-selected it to deliver a prototype for the first phase of the Army's Ground Station modernization in support of the Army's Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node program. The contract value for this phase is $8.5M, with a potential contract value of approximately $250M over all 4 phases. Palantir was awarded a Phase 1 Project Agreement through an Other Transaction Agreement with Consortium Management Group on behalf of Consortium for Command, Control and Communications in Cyberspace. During the first phase of the effort, Palantir will collaborate with the Army to design and demonstrate the ground station prototype solution for the Army's TITAN program. The Palantir solution will leverage space, high altitude, aerial, terrestrial sensors and data sources for use in intelligence and military targeting operations. It will field a "turn key" solution for the Army that integrates data from a variety of sources including commercial and classified sources from space to ground sensors. The results of the first phase of this competitive contract will be used by the Army to inform awarding of future phases and eventual production of the ground station for the TITAN enterprise.Citi downgrade and new contract = double downgrade 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡That's it selling apple and buying more GME.Tim Apple is a cuckI hate aapl.

The objective is to determine if a stock is red or green currently. My logic is if current price - previous close = + then green. And vice versa.

#LMAO HE REALLY THINKS IM GOING TO BE PAYING ATTENTION?Buy 10 GME shares if you read thisThis is just the beginning, GME is going higher in the following monthsThe amount of bagholding losers in this sub who refuse to give up on PLTR and start making profitable trades is, frankly, stunning.I think Apple is officially done. It just cant grow anymore and has to pander to the madness of crowdsReading some of the tickers you clowns are jumping into rn makes me believe many of you legitimately DO enjoy losing your money 🤣

A toddler with 5 crayons shoved up its ass could pick better tickers 

(I’m looking at you DoorDash calls as a hedge guy)Apple embracing their white guilt and handing jobs and money to black people is bearish right?I don't get why companies take on these socially charged initiatives with company money.  Tim, if you want to tackle systemic racism, good for you (honestly), but do so with your own fucking fortune.  You can still get the morally-driven investors' attention without dipping into Apple's massive cash pile (which by the way is becoming less attractive when it's used like this).[deleted]GOEV is the new short squeeze play, buying another 500 shares on openWhy they downgrading our boy PLTR?All my homies hate citiPlease nioFellow Palantards, today we received a vicious and malicious attack from those citi cucks, remember we must hold the line!

SQUEEZE

WE AREN'T SELLING TIL AT LEAST $40biggest regret of my life is that I didn't go all in on GMETHIS IS THE SQUEEZEGME!!!!!!!Apples new diversity dividend giving $1000 to all non white shareholders#Guh-evFor real though, AAPL probably realized they had 99% market share for white people and significantly less in the African American, latino, etc communities - this is probably a low-key hella smart tactic to pull Samsung/Google smartphone customers into the Apple ecosystem and App Store where a lot of the LTV comes fromJust imagine if slavery was legal somewhere in the world, how lit the iPhones made there would be.  Just sick profit margins.

That's how schizophrenic capitalism is.So GOEV pumped because of the upcoming Apple announcement? Which turned out to be about racial justice?????Do you think Tim 🍎 will let the Uyghur slaves who build his iPhones use his black only learning centers?PLTR is like PFE now lol. Boomer stock.God. Fucking. Dammit. I’m so sick of this shit. I know these are leaps but this is going to sting today. Should I sell and trade for AAPL leaps or just hold these hoping they recover in next 3 months? I fucking swear this stock can’t catch a break

Every cent you drop costs me money. So inconsiderate!BFT and my gf are nothing alike, BFT loves going down on meFuck shitibank glad i cancelled all my cards last year. So shitty that it hasnt recovered since 2009.💩How is it not illegal for “analysts” to downgrade a stock then scoop up shares when it dipsCore CPI data released for the US at 8:30 AM.  There has been speculation by some of the Federal Reserve members about inflation rising sooner than the current FOMC outlook.  If the Core CPI numbers are higher than expected, the market may go down today.  This could signal that these FOMC members predictions might have some weight, meaning interest rates going up sooner than anticipated currently.GME gang is the most sensitive 🌈 gang.

Anyone else buying the dip and bagholding?apple car doesnt have the appeal, i mean its cool to have an iphone, but lets be honest how many people can afford an apple car, unless its $25k i dont see apple winningWHY IS PLTR GETTING ALL THIS HATE. IT'S LITERALLY UNFAIRNIO puts printing 🤑PLUG is the most retard strength stock I've ever seen.

I will average down my puts.AAPL mega trash i bet whatever they announce today will make it go downieI hate 🍏The market isn't even open yet you goddamn retardsThe past few days it's been getting in my head that I should
sell ~5% of my TSLA position.

E.g. sell $25,000 today.  TSLA will continue to go up, perhaps
to $1000+ during this year.

Next January, sell another $25,000.  TSLA will crash mid-year.
But if it doesn't, then the next January sell another $25,000, etc.

The TSLA rise may continue for another 3 or 5 years, who knows,
but it's been 13 years since a recession.  There's got to be one,
5 years from now tops.

I don't like doing a lot of little transactions, but this seems to
me the best way.

I don't like taking the tax hit, letting it ride is much safer,
but I'm just starting to feel antsy.  (Of course, last time I felt
antsy I sold a boatload of TSLA at $890 pre-split.)

Also, my kids are having some issues and it's looking like
child care costs are going to triple for two of our kids.  Starting
to feel the pinch for cash again.Guys, Apple going full BLM is bullish. They just got the entire black market in the states. Now, Samsung will look like racists, cause they didn’t do it first.

Seems better for companies to just stay out of it. The news today will probably all be how they didnt do enough or they are just pandering or how they use Chinese slaves blah blah.NIO going to 66 today.Apple could have announced they were giving away iPhones and their stock would still go sidewaysWhat apple announced is racist as fuk 

Change my mindCongress is wasting time today trying to impeach a President that is on his way out of office and probably will never be a viable candidate again.

I don’t care if you like Trump or not, that’s a monumental waste of time and resources for their own political gain. During a pandemic they also used for political gain at our cost..

While MSFT and AMZN are slapfighting over JEDI deal and other contracts that seem to matter, AAPL is doing a power play to get full govt support seeing as they cater to giving made up electric vehicles specifically for the two-spirit transgender navajo fox-kin.   
AAPL is playing n-th D Chess. Bullish and yes I know this is a Wendy's.Get ready for four years of pointless virtue signaling.Lol pltr just got a quarter billion dollar contract and is crashing because of a hit job by Citi. Literally makes no sense.TSLA.., you are dead to me. You bastard.AAPL is just marketing to their future consumers. Same way Nike supported the kneeling. It’s smart business and on top of that it’s the right thing to do. You get to be “brave” while at the same time selling more planned obsolescence crapple stuff to future earners. Same thing they did back in the day giving iMacs to schoolsTSLA just crash already. We all know it’s gonna happen.

Who’s more retarded? 

Team RKT or GME Gang?Anybody in GOEV for the long haul? Feeling bullish when a company like Apple in talks of buying them and they're just looking for investment and it sounds like other blue chips in talks with them, partnered with hyundai.

Holding shares that I just bought before the pop and 2 5/21 30c contracts and feeling like the right move might be to sell one contract at the top today and let the rest ride.

Or im the only retardFUBO is a sports streaming service that yesterday announced they are buying a sports book company to accelerate their entry into sports gambling. Draftkings sits at a market cap of around 40b and they do not have a streaming service. Fubo is sitting around 2.5b. If they can grow their gambling business, which should be easy given they already have a subscriber base, we could see a huge jump in the next year or so. Also, fubo was trading in the 60s a few weeks ago but dropped down to the 30s. Could easily see a run back to the 60s and beyond in the coming monthsMy calls in ICLN went up 33% yesterday, hope to see it again today!Aapl fuckWhat is going on with AMD?Imagine being outperformed by INTC 🤡This AMD drop might literally be the most retarded panic selling i have seen in my life?

The Q3 numbers fubo reported (58% paid subscriber increase and 71% surge in revenue) were impressive, and the Q4 preliminary report shows a surprisingly strong increase in both metrics. The strategic acquisitions of Balto and Vigtory increase fubo’s competitiveness, and they will release a sports book app by the end of the year. The legal allegations against fubo seem to be without merit, and the stock has shot up over 34% in a day in spite of the allegations, so that should be telling.

---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give optimistic guidance for 2021 (due to a vaccine being available and an actual competent administration). However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. 

Have a nice day and make a lot of teddies today!

P.S.
The most liquid strike and expiration is $35c June. But looking at how it's moving even before earning season, i think even the $40c June will be ITM and print bigly before June.

Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.I’m here for this.

$12C for Jan 22.When I first started investing I bought a bunch of F because "the dividends are good" and "it's a reliable company." I have never had an invest slowly bleed out like they did. Fuck that boomer shit7c 1/22 couple weeks ago paid less the 100 on iv was about 3is super cheapGood so now hopefully people stop talking about that waste of money.What's their PE?It was a rating downgrade but a price target upgrade ($10 to $15).yes. from C. C = shitron gay bears. slightly dumber than cramer man_heroic Kendall Jenner noises_Also went up $1T in market cap over that time.

I’ll buy those shares. Not your FD’s.Yeah fuck this bullshit jonestlySell covered calls near the money and make more tendiesSameShort squeeze. Look at what happened to QS over the last month. If you got out with profits your are good. There's going to be some bag holders very soonSure hope not.TSLA is less than 10% of my portfolio now, not just saying this cause I own a couple calls. But you’re like the 100th person that has spoken too soon. I’ve seen pre market be down 10% then up 10% by open, but also vice versa. Not tryna talk shit, just be careful when using after hours data to make decisions for yourself. It seems to not be a good indicator for what’s going to happen when market actually opens. Literally 2 hours ago it was over 860. What’s to say in 2 hours it won’t jump back?I bought a Put.

At least they’ll probably be out of antitrust investigations.>AFRM

You know what is stupider than thinking about money you don't have? Planning what to do with money you don't have.Yeah this was the high IQ play to align themselves with the new wave of blue in control. I’m all for it.What they do?No one for one second believes AAPL is a right wing company.Maybe but why the fuck would they just not drop it out of the blue instead of saying "big announcement tomorrow" and shooting their stock in the footHoly cockFront page worthy frThats a 5 bagger minimum.Citi downgrade to sell>can someone less lazy than me look into it please thanks

They can’t just sell their stock in the company because that can collapse the price as well as give up control.  They usually try and announce the the price is surging as to keep a stabilized price. If you sell when it’s down you
Can destabilize your stock as well.Doesn't it mean that the company needs cash?They’re  selling shares to generate income so their earnings report isn’t dog shit, yes they believe they’re price is high and they’re trying to profit from itI know morning about LMND. Could be that, or an indication that they need more cash for either growth or to stay afloatCould indicate either high price (ZM) or they are desperate for capital (GME)One of many reasons, alot of it has to do with raising capital for whatever the company needs.Yes. Just like Tesla doing an offering at $500TSLA 880c 1/15.

&#x200B;

So Im not bragging but just giving an example, I have 23$ c and 25$c expiring in april, those are up bigly today because Im practically In the money /ITM so my contracts are more valuable because we have 4 months to get to 23/25 + we are AT 23 RIGHT NOW so that makes me contracts worth infinite amount more .

Yeah i took a 4k Loss learning options too... You really want ITM/In the money plays mostly with far out dates, 3 months ish or 6 montish, I NEVER win with OTM plays tbh, always won with somewhat ITM or like, things that take 5$ to make me money, not like 14$ in your case with 36$ calls.

&#x200B;

I love you retard, keep your head up high. We are here for you \~

&#x200B;

Edit: I FORGOT TO MENTION, IF YOU HAVE APRIL CALLS THAN YOU COULD HOLD AND MAYBE IN A MONTH WHEN WE ARE AT 30/IF WE ARE AT 30 YOUR 36$C WILL BE WORTH MORE THAN TODAY I PROMISE!!! YOU JUST NEED FAR DATED CALLS OR ROLL YOUR CALLS TO APRIL/JUNE/DECEMBER ETC/ 

OR BUY SHARES MY BROTHER!!! YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH SHARES BECAUSE ITLL KEEP GOING UP AND YOU CAN HOLD THAT FOREVER!! I BELIEVE IN YOU!!Don’t buy 80% out of the money and that won’t happenMaybe you accidentally bought puts idk bro1) Didnt say the expiration

2) you chose a contract thats more than 100% OTM if you dont include today - of course no one wants that garbageWell yeah they’d be losing money that way.Probably down. Most people have to purchase them shits.Nothing is being taken away from youWhat they say?And let the orange have all the benefits for the rest of his life?

Also, if he is then why should we take care of him until he is dead?Lol no. “Waste of time” is the dumbest take on this situation.

This is literally congress’s chance to shut down trump fascism. If they don’t do anything because “he’s almost out of office anyway” it would be a huge mistake.>don’t care if you like Trump or not, that’s a monumental waste of time and resources for their own political gain.

maybe a new CEO is actually worth that much thoughYupCareful.  Alteryx did exactly this -- new CEO in Oct 2020, went from 113 to 145 overnight and maintained that range for about a month.

Hovered for a while, but shit the bed again in NOV 2020 back down to 115 after shit earnings.

They've had much better than expected us phone sales Q4, grown to capture 20% China phone market share, grown to capture 49% laptop market share, EV news at a good time with a partner, playing ball with the new administration, and iPhone 13 coming with bigger rumored improvements than just a refresh (we'll see if the stimmy goes to these for people who havnt upgraded in abit).

Apple would also have the least to worry about out of big tech for taxes and anti-trust. Hell even this racial fund is a good thing in terms of avoiding those. 

The issue is people buying weeklies on Apple, it's an earnings and leap sort of company.This just proves the entire GME thesis.

Well, of course I know him. He's me"My calls don’t have that longThis.  He knows what he is doing.

Search the webpage for the HTML color code? Not a bad idea either.Thanks but I literally FOMOed at yesterday's top and just bagheld like an idiot. Caused me a lot of stressDude just played the smartest move of the year. What a better time to get on the side of those transitioning into power than now. This will help them with the Biden administration and makes them a positive company siding with the Dems.

They could all be fake and I wouldn't know the difference.Umm.. well can they mine faster? lolLiterally sameExcept Citigroup was a financial advisor for the IPO...Apple makes roughly $160m in a single day.

They are spending about 40% of 1 days revenue for a marketing campaign that people are now talking about.

I peeped the chart. Hopefully you’re in the green by now.

Edit: stop editing your comment. You’ve completely changed it like 3 times now smhNo, it isn't.  This is over.  Amazon has vast documentation of Parler users committing crimes, and Parler refusign to moderate its own criminal content in breach of agreement.  In addition, 0 merit to competition as there are numerous other services (who also deny this sort of behavior) available to host.   In order for Parler to win, they would have to convince a court that corporations should be FORCED to host illegal and immoral content, no matter what their contract stipulates, and that ALL hosting services other than aws are not competition.Already has a plant with production expected to start next quarter  and backed by Arab Money.

Options meta looks interesting but not seeing much elseCan it pop like $10?You mean otm weeklies ;)Of course, but assuming I do can I hold something for a year+ to lock in long term capital gains?It’s more selling OTM calls, so if the stock reaches that point, I just sell them anyway for a gain..

Did you read my post?He was with them in spirit jacking to the riots in the white house watching it on his big screenI've heard that this isn't going to happen and that it is.

So it is going to happen?Are you sure it wasn’t just me three times?Think it may piggyback?Honestly, probably a decent idea. If you’ve have your day trade safety net just get FD’s.Conversely, it has concerned me greatly how this global etf has somehow exploded to become the second most mentioned ticker on this sub. I don’t get it. I’m invested myself and this sub has a tendency to be late to the party, so is icln another Palantir, GME, or spce where a few early people made money, it became super popular ticker and the creator of thousands of bagholders? I keep reminding myself that, no, it can’t be another Palantir or GME by its very nature as a global etf, but if you just were to read the posts themselves and didn’t know that, you’d think it was falling victim to the same fate.It's been green and in a V-shaped recovery for a week bro, coming back from the typical post-merger dump.Source?This is the way.That’s what I’m thinking. Thanks, my dude.I don’t think I’m gonna look a gift horse in the mouth. If this holds through premarket I’m just gonna ship it. I’m already up huge so I don’t think it’s worth the risk.True but I’ve found the regret from gains lost through holding too long hurts me way worse than missing on an extra jump.Username checks outThey will if ol zuck won’t get in line and rig her election too 🤣Aw man, can I get an early morning break? Probably don’t deserve it anyways. Still retarded.Highly regardedYeah I have Mostly Feb 19 exp.

RemindMe! 2 weeksI feel like either dump now and move on or be prepared to hold it for the next few years no matter what happens.Yeah, I know it will rip one day, it definitely will after earnings so I'm holding it for at least until feb.Yeah we need a culture change here.

I am in actuality a very serious and intelligent person!!!!!+1, really like the streetsmartedge platform.heard some stocks weren't available on rh and wanted to move up a little. i didn't think i'd be able to make this much money off of trading, so hitting 5k is a good indicator for whether or not i'm serious about this. it's more of a personal thing, and i'm looking to fund my way through grad school with my gains and hold stocks until i die. 

i just got the vibe that rh is like entry level. i've got a good 2k to go before i got 5k, so i'll see how things look for me tbh.thank you bro this actually was some pretty good insight. do you trade options at a high volume? and how much would you actually keep in your rh account at one time? i'm scared of not being able to transfer out my gains or some shit lolThat news has been going all week.   Futures were green at 5am. Now I checked and it's redYeah, they’re ass fucking those people too leveraged.Agree lol

I can see them doing huge things.Apparently retards are buying it lol1/2022 leaps...From my limited research, it seems like they will be a large player in the smart home and smart car revolution (because come on, we've known for 50 years that technology will progress us to the Jetsons level)

Even their website is entirely different than I expected, I was very impressed with the substantial changes they've made to their company (at least on the surface level)

Also, peep the deal they have with Canoo (GOEV) to design their ADAS for the smart cars, and GOEV has connections to Hyundai, which has connections to AAPL...I'm not tbh. I think this a good play.

Up 60%.ICLNLol I’ve been holding ICLN for a long time too but I’m not really qualified to give advice. I just thought ahead to what industries would do well with a Democrat in charge and got lucky to choose some winnersIt's split, retard.

Been above 70 for virtually the last week. It literally cannot sustain this, one because it’s not TSLA, and two because they lose money. I expect this to be in mid 180s today.ya defenses are aggressive at 860Sorry Jerome 🙏🏻 JPOW 🚀The children have tiny hands give them a breakThey did a direct offering, not an ipoPeople did not expect this kind of announcement (because they have unhealthy expectations) in my opinion and for this trading day I think the announcement won't move the stock price up.I think more of sideway action, but don't take my word on it.Never selling shares babyyy. Also if you think a war isn't coming to lift countries out of the recession you are seriously retarded btw.Nah, you’re just a retardI might have to bail out of this company with all this woke bullshit unless it brings in extra profitshttps://imgur.com/gallery/V6iAYtX

It's down to aobut $29k right now and was as low as 27k when it dipped yesterday. 

Should've held off purchasing it last week woulda got in at a much better price but oh well.I held deep itm weeklies (30.5 1/15c) overnight but planning on selling at least 90% around open. Then roll out after the mid morning dip 🤞🚀 🌙No clue.Well at least you made some money. Nothing wrong with that.

And apple, googl, etc. tbis all happened right in front of their eyes and they didn’t do anything about until enough people complained. 

This’ll push stronger regulations from each of them, and most likely some legislation to hold them accountable (230), which still fucks them Long term.

Which means more censorship! Nice work libs!Since 5am 😎I’m building a startup, and sneaking in 2 hrs of trading...2/19Cross your fingers and hope Biden helps you out tomorrow.APHA/TLRY these 2 companies are merging 

CGC
CRLBF
CCHWF
GTBIF
MSOS

These are just a few, but I would wait to get in. I feel
They will consolidate in the next few weeks. Now APHA/TLRY merger is supposed close in Q2 March/April tike frame. This will create largest Cannabis company in the world. They have a deal with Anheuser Busch INV (BUD).Big established Canadian companies that are going to absolutely devour the patchwork of state business once US goes federally legal. 

EV, weed, stable government. Look at me. Democrats are money now. Thanks Buyden very cool.You musta bought stupid ass callsThey had a public offering not too long ago, which usually means down - but like TSLA did BLNK shot up on they’re public offering, they went from 41-50; profit taking one day and now they are set to take off againno they're afraid Fed will change interest rates based in rising inflationI too wonder about this contradiction every time it gets raised.Damn... in comparison they are just damn near free.YesI’m a retard too but I don’t think thats how it works, if you sell OTM call, you have to buy back to close the position. 

Say you sold a $30 call for $0.25, while the price is $20. Say the price rose to $29 bringing the option closer to the money, because you’re short the $30 call to close you’d buy that contract back. In this scenario, you’d buy back for $1.00 for a loss of $0.75. 

Id look at credit spreads.Stay strong brother sending love, i only do shares now been burned too many timesIn that case then goev

Apple already passed up on them and that says somethingFair enough, but it’s gonna keep going up. Slowly, but it’s gonna keep going.That’s in the sequel!if only we were allowed to change our usernameslol

I was in a similar but not nearly as bad situation as yours and went back to therapy and that helped a lot. Maybe think about doing the same thing.I’m happy to hear that. Keep trying - you can do it.You should read more on what you invest in so you know why it’s a good investment. I watched people buy buy buy and then panic all in 12 hours while the market wasn’t even open. It’s extremely telling of people’s intelligence. Doesn’t matter, I read. GOEV will be everywhere in 5 years.I don’t see it?WestMara is solid as long as corn is above 27k.Should have put “ “ around it. 😂Well also consider GME recently was trading at 1x earnings.It’s true they’re closing stores but lots of retailers are downsizing unprofitable sites.  It’ll take revenue down but improve profitabilityr/wooshGo fuck off to r/conservative ya skyward bound twatThanks 😆oh ok. You have to realize that American moms and people who like buying physical games/used games will still to go GameStop for its convenience and popularity. If I wanted a pre-owned game I'd go to GameStop rightaway to save a few bucks. Also gamestop is now focusing more on digital e-commerce and now with Ryan Cohen and other two former members of Chewy joining in the future looks bright for GME. Just find GME in /r/wsb and you'll see a ton of infoStrangers showing up at your door and then haggling at the last minute?

NahLmfao the equivalent of my pp is bigger than your pp. Fucking 🤡I dunno, I'm bored🧐I have a bridge to sell you.I don't know what that has to do with anything.😂 I didn't get enough butt action 🥺All the best with it! Big props for starting so early.yea i have calls only on 4 stocks, all high volume. i put 30k total into my robinhood and am not gonna add any more. and don’t worry about that, robinhood has its flaws but if you have nice gains and wanna transfer them to your bank account or to your schwab account you’ll be fine (if you wanna transfer positions to schwab you’ll have to pay a fee of 75 bucks, transferring cash is no fee though)I’m just saying...that’s a pretty good reason to be red lmaoI would say 100 is unrealistic but a 15 percent jump in the first 30 mins is pretty solidHe “bought the dip”I’m sorry you’re holding so many bags you have to lie like that

I know the people at Stripe and they say hi but not a chance in hellStripe is a 50B co. No fucking way they get SPACd.Lmao my bad, I wasn’t sure if I made that clear or not from the original postOne of my only qualitiesYea I’ve got a 3x long Tesla ETF currently bleeding me dry because of course I bought the day before NIO day. Holding it long term thoughhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwera5/jimmy_boy_might_be_pickup_up_the_gme_story/PLTR is dead and downgraded. Go check our Cramers Twitter. He’s gonna pump GMELmfaoLol I didn't know either way and I've been holding it for over a month. Obviously I did my DD.I dont think it’s a private corporations job to educate the people on social injustice. It’s a nice gesture but it benefits them more than anything. It’s marketing money well spent. Look at us talking about it.


What I mean is, it’s a calculated investment, not a gift. If they really wanted to make a change, it would cost much more. But it’s not their job to solve this issueYes daddyAnd you good sir!man - I guarantee the same people posting on those subs are the ones posting on this one at my work. I swear its that weird group that just do it to try and one up each other and humble brag. its fucking bizarrelol someone at least just called him out on the message board and said what he is saying is complete BSthat's my favorite way 2 tradeAm unloading my leaps today on this piece of junk..... and buy back only during then I guessYeah there are condos here. I'm not from here tho so i just use the terminology i'm familiar withDidn’t even notice he commented lmao. Yeah, it’s weird that they have their own community.Thanks for an honest answer, I agree with you. I’m holding for the long term. The more I read on GME the more I believe that this is a long term hold rather than looking to profit from the short squeezeWe live good lives ? 

We are forced to go to work, while our government tries to keep us from interacting in our free time. 

We are wage slaves.Bro, that’s a gem. She’s so slutty yet classy at the same time. Good lookin out 🙏I literally just imagined her jumping out of a birthday cake butt naked and crawling on all fours telling me she wants Daddy’s birthday loadTo be fair 1/22 is so next Friday. Easy mistake.I wanna know who was the dumbass that hyped up this bullshitWow how stupidOh shit I thought you were ragging from when I posted that ACI was a good buy-in right now haha. Glad to see someone else sees long term potential for it.Definitely not holding through ERI’m so sorry. There’s too many retards who don’t understand and won’t go down to see it in the thread so I’ve been pasting it. Realized that’s probably spammy. Thanks for letting me knowStill a majority. Still able to control the rules in the Senate. Still able to control the legislative agenda.  You’re downplaying the significance of all this. Agree about Manchin and moderates.yeah lets create a prayer circle for the stimmy talks tomorrow to send TSLA to the moonso what were you saying?Order book is completely manipulated. The float and trade volume is tiny so it’s super easy to move the price. Most of this run has been short squeeze.Well they better fucking mine faster and the stock better be < 21 by March, otherwise I’m toast. Go children gooooooooooooooooTrue but doesn’t change the point as the banks still get approximately the same cutSome were thinking it’d be a vaccination announcement.

So it may move up just because they aren’t passing out free vaccines at their stores. 🤷‍♂️

But not a price moving announcement.Sure. Let's hope it's trying to go upHoping for mass death and imperialism is super coolCool story broFound TrumpTV’s first customer[deleted]But that's not what it closed at like you said...What do you think about $30 1/21/2022 

Only $201 each....

Part of me even thinks that’s not being greedy enough due to the merger and if any sort of legalization happens I think it’ll truly fly

Canadas legalization soared it to $300 somehow in 2018Bro it literally says legalize comedy it ain’t the deepBecause of that it'll hit 40 EOW 😂So the short squeeze is next week ? Or todayYo we gonna moon today ?FUCKwell when ya don't short by calling the top yeah it's pretty easy

You wait for the bulls to break down firstIndeed. A dude paid me probably $200 by himself just to send selfies in my boxer briefs 😁Yeah I’m not too sure right now . Guess will see next few days. Makes me mad Xpev and LI pumped so hard yesterday and we fell redOk, thanks.By feb 19 puts on feb 5 and then the same dates in mayThere’s a SPAC etc#THERES A SPAC ETFS P C XSPAKGMEOuch?Yea I’m thinking $20 is more reasonable.No no, LEAPS are a big part of my strategy for a while now.. i just went way too big selling premium on FCEL.. i sold 11 strike calls just after Xmas, and you can obviously see how far that's went against me but i was able to meet margin requirement up until now.. just the way she goes i guess.. but i bought PLUG puts yesterday with what was left.Doubt it bruh. MAGAts can't flyGotcha, thanks. You think it's still worth buying calls at open today?What would I see?I'm very aware of the shelf offering. On the call they said they have no intentions of using it, only if its a dire situation.No but I don’t think you can continue to collect UI from the job you lost if you’re “willing & able to work” the same job again.ok callout will be in Vegas first to make sure that shit ignites.Lol you’re so hurt. What a nerd 😂we are the captain nowOh fuck off. There are 20 comments saying the same thing, go cry elsewhere.I got MARA and NIO stocked long, aiming for Pluto, just gotta buy the dipWow, you are just out of touch with reality.  But either way, PARLER is fucked, as I said.  Which is a huge positive for the world.  You say censorship, the majority of people say: "not allowing you to commit crimes".  Freedom of speech, does not include violence towards others or the removal of their rights as you right-wing nuts seem to think is fine.

Because lets face it, only the dumbest, most impotent, losers embrace conservative policy (with the caveat that there are a few very rich creeps who enjoy stealing from you clowns).hell ya. big gains incomingDon't forget to tip us off insider style when your startup makes an agreement to go public via SPACI’m not even trading ICLN. RH shows calls down on a 1%+ yesterdaylooks like a cup and handle on the daily.. handle hasn’t formed yet. potential downward before breakoutOhh but there is no way they fed would raise rates right now. That would be insaneYou have to weigh the risks tooNo, a call is a right to buy 100 shares at a certain price. So imagine I have 100 shares of a company X, and I sell a call for 200 bucks at a strike of 30 and X is trading at 20 right now. If X is at 35 by the time the call expires, I have to sell my shares of X at a price of 30. I lose out on the 500 I would’ve gotten if I didn’t sell the call, but I also gain the 200 premium, and I gain the 1,000 from X going from 20 to 30but the burn hurts so goodhopefully it does, it'll be a sad day if/ when all of the original U.S automakers go out of business for good[deleted][deleted]Nothing that’s why there’s a sell off right nowNot for this sub, no. But then I’d have to assume that means the momentum is on big NGA. 

Assume means hope, right?You’re not wrong. PM this morning was a huge mislead. Looks like we’re gonna see GME continue it’s rise to power, plug will eat it for today, and Tesla well Tesla just needs to break 860 and then that’ll stop being flatI bought Feb callsThanks broOnly one dreaming is idiot buying GME; a company with no future.Closing stores = desperate for money and everyone like digital more now, trend will only continue with thing like xbox game pass, anyone who know videogame industry understand thisNah I’ll stay here and piss off your kind some more.BRING ON THE STRONG VHe deffo FOMOed at the topi agree, to hype this up definitely makes it weird. But the reaction on here is beyond APPL, which is why i'm a lil peeved.It's just depressing seeing people bragging about their shit investments thinking they're some sort of fucking genius when if they'd YOLO'd into TSLA they could have probably quadrupled their investment 😂Yeah it's a tough call. We've been range-bound for ages now. Who knows what will happen once insiders can sell at will. I think institutions will snap the shares up tho.Right lol.. ‘round here you rent apartments, buy condos / townhouses etc.. where do you “buy” apartments?In that case, thank you for your service.There’s just something about that half awake no makeup hungover I just got fucked all night look she gives. And the innuendos omgAh! Sorry man. Not trying to blast yah over it.All you can expect Biden to do is agree to another climate deal that's not even binding for us unless Congress ratifies it (which they won't do) and to do whatever he can within the powers of the executive branch. This means he'd decrease the supply of oil & gas, which will make the price go up. He has expressed some interest in a version of cash for clunkers. That's as much as we can expect him to get through this Congress. Meanwhile, expect big increases in oil and gas consumption across Asia. 

I expect the price of XOM to rise in the intermediate future so that the dividend yield isn't so out of whack. Eventually the stock price will put the yield somewhere in the 4% ballpark. This, and not some lottery ticket, was was where I put most of my 2020 investing money in. I have almost 2,500 shares. I also bought a decent amount of Big Tobacco and a small number of other blue chips. The only long term meme stock I'm holding is PLTR, just 185 shares. 

My focus for 2021 is Altria and PM. I'd like to get my tobacco holdings up to around where my XOM holdings are.I’m in, but I wasn’t planning on holding into tomorrow.Lol you’re bagging about 2%? Wasn’t this turd at $30 a couple months ago?You got puts? I got a 1/29 165p when it was at 195-196 yesterday. We’ll see.Cope more, I said that every recession/depression since WO2  has been "solved" with war. 

If this is too real for you get an ETF and fuck off.That’s not wokeYou don’t understand what woke means. Or you are trolling. Either way you’ll find out soon enough when Wakanda starts to control everything.There’s no doubt at all that it will fly if it gets legalized. That’s the part that we’re gambling with. No legs no jump, and probably just a steady decline forever. 

Personally I’m doing $15 1/21/22

More expensive, little safer, but also let’s me cash out for profits easier in the short term if I’m wanting access to more money for some reasonI’m not even going deep!

Its a cancel culture reference. Probably more specifically to the pronoun memes he sent out.What the fuckNot complaining as the other half of my portfolio exists out of XPEV 😅 but it sucks after the great announcements that they have made on NIO day, which for me was higher than my anticipation.Spac elfOh my god we’re all billionairesMy shares of MARAI prefer 15 to be on the cautious side but I woulda fired off on the 16-17 calls as wellFCEL was really fun selling puts on for a while but I’m glad I didn’t get assigned tbhI would love to be wrong in this case!No idea. I'm not putting any more into this one personally. Might still go up though its a relatively small cap co.Well a vaccine isn’t the end all be all to protection against Covid anyway. I’d still be worried of catching it if I had a respiratory issue like asthma. I say go for the vaccine. You can still be wary of returning to work with a vaccineOh lovely, I’ll dm ya real quickWhy i get da bootNah I really just want you to leave the board and not come back. Try r/politics those are your people.you're the one crying fuckin retard. go back and read your cry baby comments. you big fuckin cry baby baby. WAHHH I MAKE BAD DECISIONS WAHHHHHH WHAHHHHH WAHHHHHHREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIt’s interesting that dems want unity and look at the response I get. “Out of touch with reality”. “Dumb impotent loser”. “Clowns”. The most hypocritical party of all time. 

What’s even more funny because I’m anti-censorship I’m “right wing”   How about considering I voted for Joe biden because trumps a dumbass?  

Point is that It’s a slippery slope to start censoring. If you don’t think it’s dangerous when big tech controls the narrative, I have a bridge to sell you.Lol !  But actually a good idea to let this group of geniuses & retards knowOne of the holdings did poorly, 1% is nothing on options when I tripled my account last week YOLOing on themOh nvm crayons do whatever you do broYou sure proved me wrong bud, great comeback and everything.

Back to twitter cupcake :xPeople making credible threats of violence is an arrestable offence. And no, you're right, we definitely do not have the technology to track people down from their Internet activity.

Fuck me you're dense. You truly belong here.No it just means NGA holders are kind of desperate for retail buys rather than having news that adds momentum/excitement without spam begging on another ticker.Good luck my guyBeing a 🌈GME🐻 is gonna be bad for your health retard. I wouldn't bet against Ryan CohenLmfao 🤡🤡🤡Do you think the leaps is worth holding? I got in at $8 for a 2023 45C. 

They keep getting good news n new contract but keeps getting downgraded wtfI grew up in Japan, where you buy apartmentsDidn’t think you were lol. I wasn’t trying to grief you either. I just actually reviews a bunch of ICLN holding and was like damn. Less of a US etf then I thought. I think a lot of people are expecting a huge pump on ICLN in the coming days. I would love that, but I think it will be more subtleI’m short shares and long puts and got absolutely annihilated yesterday. I’m considering just closing everything and coming back closer to March 9 which is when lockup period ends and all the private investors can sell. I have a buddy who works there as a low level sales rep and he’s a multi millionaire I have to imagine a lot of them will be selling first chance they get.[deleted][deleted]What’s that?Yeah well i would have been up 15K instead of down 60K if i sold puts instead of fucking calls.. man. This shit will not stop rallying.Yeah I might as well, I doubt I’ll even be able to get it before my UI expires in March anyway so it will probably be good timingdunnoI guess your mom didn’t put enough vanilla extract in your pancakes this morning. It’s okay your obese ass will survive 😂>reeeeeeeeeYou are getting that after calling the "other side" tards and threatening them.  *Shocked face*

"Why does no one like me when I mistreat them constantly and abuse others and promote violence and want to take away everybody's basic human rights?"

DUuuuuuuuurrrrrrrthat’s not what I’m saying. April calls up only 2% when icln up 1% eodNot going near that autistic thing, I just know it's retarded and playing with fireMy gut says hold. But ngl, the downgrades make me think shit i dunno.Right. The amount of people who jumped into this play have zero understanding of what a ETF is and how it works. Well get a pump but in reality I’m expecting this to be at 60-70 by 2022. Using this has my main investment while I roll FDs on meme stocksWoke is social justice warrior/racial equity bullshit not being mad your guy didn’t win the electionMmmmmk simp.There’s a SPAC elfOof I saw a recovery play from SRPT at the beginning of this week if it’s not too late I would get in MAR19 100c or just some shares atleast.Understandable, have a nice dayS'alright. I didn't even get a ban notification, I just noticed one day I got boxed out. No biggy.And in classic dem fashion, you ignore my point. Not sure where I called you a “tard” or threatened you, but okay. 

Good luck to you, make sure you wear your helmet!Thanks buddy I think imma hold and average down. Long term outlook for this company does look q juicy though but idk man.... this is insane.... would they ever go up....!What?Prob do GILD and BABA.I addressed your "point".  Noone likes you because you want to mistreat them all.  You call them names.

You can't even read your own writing?

Sounds like you got issues.  Here, have some tissues child. Did that help make it better?

No, well, that's rough.  Maybe you will learn from your experience and try treating others slightly better instead of clinging to an ideology of hate.  

Otherwise, we will have to step in and continue to be the "bad guys", enforcing consequences to your negative actions.

You poor little thing.I like the GILD idea, not sure how I still feel on babaI never called you a tard nor threatened you. Go back and read.

You clearly want big tech to think for you instead of thinking for yourself. That’s hilarious. 

We’re done here.
