I aggregated all the GME gains in one spot. It probably doesn't load at all on most mobile apps since they don't support this Reddit Collection thing. If you made a fat stack make sure you post it so you can get in the picture.

**EDIT:** We filled the first collection. I guess there's a 100 limit. Good fuckin job boys.For the last 2 months, I have been almost entirely all in GME. This week, I temporarily switched to all in PSTH and was planning on going back to GME next week.

I would have become a millionaire this morning if I hadn't switched 99% of my GME holdings over. Instead, I made $400.Biden giving tomorrows’s speech from the Wilmington Mall GameStop.The stock market is basically just giving free money to any retard willing to open a Robinhood account.u/DeepFuckingValue hasn’t sold his 1/15 call holy fuck the balls on that man LMFAO💀💀

And by love I ***actually*** mean hateI bought cyberpunk at GameStop yesterday, you're welcome wsb.Waiting for u/deepfuckingvalue to post his gains is like waiting for $TSLA earnings to be releasedAs a teacher living a miserable life during this pandemic teaching, getting on RH today and seeing my GME calls be worth more than I make in a month truly brought tears to my eyes. Unbelievable feeling and doesn't feel real lol[removed]https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366

Told you guys it wasn't the short squeeze we were looking for, this is merely the teaser.

>“We will not be seeing a massive drop in shares shorted over the next few days, more like a 10%-20% drop which would mean 7 to 14 million of shares covered, which is nowhere near the almost 70 million shares traded this morning,” the analyst said. “Long buyers are the primary force driving GME’s stock price up. “

Keep holding, shorters only covered a small % of what they shorted. Longer we hold the more they panic.GME squeeze confirmation bias porn here ya go 

https://imgur.com/gallery/x0SRNXpI’m going to be honest. Today is my cake day. I have been on this website and wallstreetbets for so long. I feel like I’ve been here to witness so many plays come and go. So many that I’ve seen enough losers and WSBers lose their money that $ROPE was always on the menu. Enough to give me PTSD from following some of them. Today, was the most genius and brilliant thing I’ve ever seen on this website and it cannot be understated what Game Gang did. They had a hypothesis, a proven thesis & conviction to not paper hand when the squeeze that was said to come never came. It took patience, determination and will. It took literally getting together to make memes to double down & then triple down & then GME was 80-90% of some people’s portfolios. You guys were fighting naked short abuse & when this was called out you nutted up banded together and reported it to the SEC. Everything was calculated and organized. And because of that, I don’t believe Max pain is even close for shorts. GME quite literally could squeeze to $50 and beyond. And you guys deserve every single second of it as long as you remain with that same conviction. I also wouldn’t blame you for taking profits and playing some other plays that I’m sure you’ve been dying to play but all your money has been Game gang diamond hands. Seriously, props to all of you. It’s one of the most legendary things I’ve seen in my life. I’ve never seen this much gain porn on the front page at once before. Ever.

Long Edit: I’ve been on this website so long that I remember being a teenager over a decade ago and the front page was scientific articles & journals shit and people actually read stuff & commented with good discussion. Now I don’t even do that shit anymore 😂🚀🚀🚀🚀Thursday, January 14. Joe Biden walks up to the podium. He immediately begins his speech by pledging 3 trillion dollars into green energy by 2025, and immediate reentry into the paris climate agreement. ICLN triples. He then says all gasoline fueled cars banned by 2025. TSLA goes to 2,000. Then for the grand finale, he announces a government contract with gamestop to include an xbox with every 2,000 stimmy check, to all 300 million americans. The rate of GME's stock price increase shuts down every financial institutions network infrastructure. Wall Street's servers all catch on fire. The last quoted GME share price anyone caught a glimpse of was well over 10,000. In the aftermath, the executives of melvin capital are charged with treason for shorting an honest american stock and short selling is banned forever. America is great again.Well, GME finally showed it’s true colors.  This is just the beginning boys.  This was just a Correction back to what the actual price should be.

Wait for the real short squeeze.  Some shorts might have covered today, but not a majority.  Still a lot more action to come these next few weeks.

GME gang gang

thx GMEPLTR next week motherfuckers.So many people sat on GME shares for weeks to make 100% with v high risk 

The real winners were yolo call buyers that made 14,000%+ in 2 hours 

Reminds me of guys holding TSLA shares for years only for it to bounce between 250-350

And retards buying calls this year riding it from 350—> $4,000+ in a few months 


Timing is everything man sheesh 


If you made 1,000%+ on GME today you’re a legend 🍾Free my man PLTR he din do nunMan it feels fucking wonderful to be on the winning side of a massive trade like GME today. I've got a heart monitor on right now for some problems and I must have logged 15 cardiac events in a matter of hours while I was working today. Dude this shits better than any drug I've ever taken

Edit: Thanks for the award kind stranger! Ya'll are trying to kill me by getting my heart rate going lmaoWaiting up until Biden announces that GameStop is becoming a Cabinet agency.warren buffet has been old all our livesMy favorite part about today: Every time that GME dropped a few cents on its way up, people would start bragging about the puts they just bought only to get fucked minutes laterIs GME continuing to ROCKET tomorrow? I NEED TO KNOW!Cramer gonna pump the shit out of GME tonight and then we go straight upGod watching /u/DeepFuckingValue do his thing gives me serious envy, dude set himself up for life and I’m over here bleeding on ICLN calls lolI have a confession:

Sold 1800 GME shares so I could play PLTR for a couple weeks and now I'm cryingWhole market rotation into GME tomorrowBreaking: Trump banned from Club Penguin# I just want to point out that I was banned by gay mods for recommending Lucid days ago and now fucking look at it.

I will now stop using large caps. Thank you.GME held up surprisingly strong in my opinion. Can’t wait to see the gains pornCan’t wait to fucking wake up at 2:02 am and see GME at 42.70I just made my annual salary in a few days on CCIV 

Really puts things in perspective

All I had to do was click a few buttons compared to working 60 hours a week for some assholeheld my gme calls expiring fridayIf deepfuckingvalue is still in gme it’s hitting $40To my GME soldiers out there. I salute you, and no matter where this journey takes us it has been an incredible ride so farI really need biden to announce "trillions of dollars to retarded energy companies" tomorrow or else there is a 9/10 chance i toaster bathAnalyst think only 7% of shorts were covered out of 71 million shares lmfaooTsla $1200 premarketKinda stupid a fund manager can just buy up companies, announce a retarded ETF filled with meme stocks, and pump her own positions to oblivion.

We told you countless times. You had every opportunity to get in, but no. You made fun of us and referenced Blockbuster. You said it would go bankrupt. You denied a short squeeze was possible.


Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.


And we're still holding.^ The idiot who bought 40c FDs on GME when it was at 34Pro tip: buy calls *before* it goes up, not after it already went upMy entire portfolio is slowly turning into just ark etfsBuying gme immediately at openARKX is a wsb wet dream lmaoYou guys doing good?

GME treat you alright?

Bout time some of you had a win.  I'm proud of you.The media is going to be pumping GME to retail all night long.  Tomorrow should be lit.If you told me GME would hit $40 in mid January mid last year, I would have called you a fucking retard. Congrats to all you fucking retards, proud of you.2021 monthly budget:

- 25% for rent

- 10% for mozzarella sticks

- 95% for GME/TSLA fds 

- 125% for Mama Cathie’s new Space exploration ETFBut really, who the FUCK shops at GameStopBan me if GME 50 tomorrow# this is a joke about futures being up alotThis sub needs to start collectively handing out upgrades and downgrades to stocks. Idk how we can get it done with a voting system or something, but I’m tired of these fucks just shelling out their ratings when shit doesn’t go their way. Also it would be fuckin hilariousMy DD on ICLN:

If we don’t go green, we die.

The End.Gamestop and wallstreetbets will go down in HISTORY for today boys, I’d hate be Melvin rn 😂It's so much easier making money when you have a larger trading account.

With 1M you can make 10k on a 1% price movement on a stonk or option. With 10k it would take a 100% movement to make the same amount.

Trading on 1% movements is incredibly easy. Even 5% movements on options is fairly easy if it's a planned trade.

This week I've been trading with 50k and easily making more than $500 per day without even leveraging my whole account. You don't even need to trade options. Just buy dips and sell for a very modest margin of profit, then look for the next dip. There's thousands of stonks and always something selling at a discount. Save options for plays where your confidence is exceptionally high.WE RUN THIS NOW

No seriously, how long before this sub gets deleted?JPow gonna roll out the carpet and set up the home run when he speaks in the morning with key phrases such as:

Not considering increasing rates

Use a full range of tools

Extended PPP

I had sex with Steven Mnuchin’s wife

Inflation target not reached

Aim for full employment

And then Sleepy comes on CNBC and lays down his shriveled up, veiny, and mucous ridden 3 trillion dollar cock. Says things like:

Biggest public works project since FDR

$2000 stimulus check, maybe more later

Expanded unemployment 

PLTR contracts

Free COVID emergency healthcare 

Student loan forgiveness

GME shares for everyone

EV tax credit

Solar

Legalize weed

On top of all that if he slaps a catchy slogan on a red hat like: Make America healthy again, or DOW 40,000

Then bears are actually fucked. Big tech voted with their wallets. Shits about to get grizzly for you bears.take out 10k in student loans

biden will announce he will forgive upto 10k in student loans

Someone called Cramer today and said he dropped $52,000 into sea world bc of WSB (who was recommending sea world??)

He’s suddenly started acting like he understands that there are no rulesMe and my girlfriend each get one exception to cheat on each other. Hers is Zach effron and mine is cathie woods 😍The SEC has concluded its investigation into user DeepValue after catching wind of astronomically high GME gains: Registered IP address discovered to be Michael Burry’s personal laptop!tomorrow is gonna be fucking insane If your future self isn't travelling back in time to prevent you from making a trade, then it's probably not that bad.Yeah the stress of trading has probably shaven at least 4 years off of my life. But after opening my robinhood up in 2017, guess who has two thumbs and made slightly over $300?I wonder if the employees of GME have any idea what’s going on lolI LOVE YOU ALL GOD DAMN , EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU!!

EVEN THE GAY BEARS WHO FUCK ME SOMETIMES BECAUSE I KNOW YOU MOFOS MAKE THE BEST MEMES EVER!!!! 

MADE 20K ON GME TODAY AND NOTHING GOES BETTER AFTER A HARD DAYS WORK THAN WATCHING THESE MEMES!!!!

I didn’t even have shares but my heart skipped a beat. I was so happy for those of you who bought in🥲

Now in GME at $34.02I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. If AOC made an OnlyFans she could singlehandedly pay off the entire debt of the United States.Vanguard 1-800 agents working overtime today. All these boomers calling to ask about this big tech company called Stop of the Game they heard about on Cramer.Waking up and watching thousands of retards comment live is how I start my dayI really hope this GME train is still goingWe are witnessing the destruction of the economy whilst getting rich from the bubble

What a time to be aliveCould you imagine having your money in a savings account right now and making -2% this yearAfter what GME did today, I’m no longer doubting WSB. Gonna get PLTR callsDuring the 2008 infinity squeeze of VW, short sellers at hedge funds were literally in tears on the phone as they tried to cover their positions. They described it as a nuclear bomb going off in their faces and were telling buyers to just name their price.



Can you imagine how amazing that must have been? Oh, right. We're about to experience it.The internet is fucking lit right now.If GME gets to 50 tmr. I will actually actually leave this place.Upvote for tendies tomorrow 🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔GME at open, full send from everyone expected.I will never doubt wall Street bets again.  I've been skeptical of all the gamestop posts here for the past month and thought you guys were delusional.  Who TF wants to go into smelly game shops anymore when there is a deadly virus spreading around and there is a much better way of streaming games instead of swapping discs now.  I still don't understand why it's up so high or how gamestop will continue being a successful business long term, but kudos to those who made bank, while I rolled my eyes at it all.ANYONE see GME today?If you think PLTR won’t hit $50 by March then gtfo. /r/investing is that way 👉🚪Made money on GME puts today. Dirty money. I imagine this is what it feels like to be a prostitute. .If gme goes up again tomorrow I’m giving everyone Reddit goldGME announced AOC will fart in mason jars and the jars will be sold exclusively in remaining Gamestop brick and mortar locationsWhen ARKX goes live I’m immediately throwing $5,000 at itGME GOING UP AGAIN FUCKKKKK IMMA BUSSYou can either go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy.

🚀🌚🚀🌚🚀🚀🚀Did Mango get peached?**YO** congrats to all of today's winners (boss ass chad bulls every one of you) but we need to tone down the momentum of getting bigger in the public eye. Fuck Jim Cramer and his cronies, fuck the boomer army, fuck Melvin Capital. Nobody should want a shoutout or recognition of retail's strength though. The more tangible effect we have the more likely the sub gets shut down.

I saw a good play so I did an instant deposit that I fully intended to process, then bought weekly spy options and they started printing, so I used a day trade and cashed out.

Then I was like fuck it I don’t need the deposit now so I canceled the deposit in the RH app. They let me keep the profits.

For legal reasons don’t do this intentionally, RH should probably fix it or whatever.Palantir has demo day on the 26th. I need gme gang to transfer attention over on Friday close thanks 😊. 29th 40c

Edit: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀Looked at ICLN put-call ratio for today. Down the chain, the put volumes were .12, .14, .04, .21, and .52 of the call volume, meaning that there were 2-25x more calls than puts bought today. EXTREMELY BULLISHgf said she gets to peg me if I end the week in the red

what's the play boys? I gotta end the week in the redWhat if deepvalue is Cohen?Do you guys remember all the DDs, literally everyday, and countless comments everyday in the daily’s, about GME? And NOW, now look at yourself, scrabbling around, fomoing after a 60% day, wondering why you didn’t buy in, wondering why you called it blockbuster, wondering how much money you could of made if you bought last week...pathetic. 

Lucky for you the ride isn’t over, so fomo away retards.I won $4 in the Powerball after a $20 investment. Buy high and sell low in everything you do.Can’t sleep.

Just remember fellow tards and singular tardette, you can be simultaneously happy for people who post insane gain porn, as well as be happy about your $100 return.

While noting that shorts definitely were a part of the buying binge, Ihor Dusaniwsky — the head of predictive analytics at financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners, which specializes in analyzing data on short selling — said he doesn’t agree that GameStop’s price surge was the result of a squeeze.
“GME’s board shake-up and stronger holiday sales is causing a long-buying tsunami, which is the primary factor for the price move,” Dusaniwsky said in emailed comments. “While I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today, this is much like the chicken-and-egg question – did long buying lead to short covering\squeeze or short covering\squeeze lead to long buying?”
Dusaniwsky believes it’s the former.
“We will not be seeing a massive drop in shares shorted over the next few days, more like a 10%-20% drop which would mean 7 to 14 million of shares covered, which is nowhere near the almost 70 million shares traded this morning,” the analyst said. “Long buyers are the primary force driving GME’s stock price up. “Sold GME calls last week for a loss. Missed out on 20k gain. Peak FOMO'd today, bought calls expiring 1/15 and then sold for 30% loss EOD lmao. I'm so fucking pathetic.I lost 700$ on GME today. AMATo everyone beating their chest because their mighty gains, time to dazzle you with a combination of confirmation bias and coming down to earth.

Wall Street is the most infested rathole of greedy cucks and a whole bunch of them are underwater on GME today.

They aren’t gonna take this lying down.
Today wasn’t a short squeeze, it was a combination of Cramer and Daddy Cohen.

Time and time again the short holders do everything they can to drive the price down when GME moons. Tomorrow will be no different. They are going to desperately drive this thing down because they have to. These assholes can’t afford to lose this big and remember fellas, the house always wins. They’ll break the law if they have to.

Expect every financial manager and Wall Street “expert” to shoot down this stock and recommend puts.

I’m expecting GME to dip tomorrow for this reason.
I took some profits today I’ll admit but only so I can go back in on the dip.

We ain’t done yet boys. Rocket ain’t even left the pad.

TL:DR Buy the fucking dip tomorrow!!!Can Tesla moon after hours pls it’s been a long dayCathie Wood filed for a space etf. Take us to the moooonMAKE PLTR GREAT AGAINRotation into everything tomorrowJust bought 200 shares GME for the fuck of it. Market value of exactly $6,420

Written in the starsTSLA consolidates for 3 days after having a 24% week & suddenly it’s a “boomer stock”.

You guys are a different breed of dumbThere was zero reason for anyone to sell GME today.Fellow GME gang

We might have another run up but please keep in mind that we will all become violent enemies of one another (taking profits) when shorts finally capitulate and close their positions.

But in the meantime, TO THE MOON.Lucid is absolutely flying. Whoever posted the DD for it I love you. Unfortunate that mods banned talking about it. Everyone could be eating tendies right now 🥴4 years of a private university. 9-5 for decades. Only to get beaten by idiots with too much money. Tough breakIT IS NOT TOO LATE FOR GME

THE SQUEEZE IS JUST GETTING STARTED 

GME COULD POTENTIALLY BE 100+ BY FRIDAY#YOU WORK FOR ME NOW GAMESTOPI clogged the toilet at olive garden lolWell, I’m retarded and officially done trying to YOLO. I’ve tried countless plays over the past year and every one has led to losing everything I have put into the market. All of them are my fault. I mean I paper-handed Tesla calls during the greatest bull run ever seen. I have been gaped by Theta gang, had many options expire worthless, and have seen my gains melt away because I diamond handed too long. I’m afraid that I will go completely broke if I continue to be in the markets.  Now I’m so depressed and poor with no income because I’m a graduate student. I’m not looking for sympathy, just venting. I’m genuinely happy for all of you who can do this and have something to show for it. One day I’ll be back. Until then, respectively, fuck you.I wonder how many GME players are banging hookers and snorting Coke off their tits right now. I’m here here with my PLTR eating chicken tendies instead of collecting them.**SPCE**

Banks are milking the shit out of popular companies and will triple the IPO price by the time it goes live for us. Examples are ABNB AFRM DASH AI.

Y'all are legit autists.Day in and day out I look at these threads and I see new traders asking about whether they should buy puts on a certain company. 

The answer is always, unequivocally and without reservation, NO. There is nothing less American than betting against a company in a capitalist society. Also, stocks only go up. 

I was fooled once and had a phase where I was bearish. I lost SO MUCH MONEY. I don’t think I’ve bought a put in at least 6 months. 

If you’re thinking that there’s gonna be a market contraction that’s fine. Don’t buy QQQ puts - buy SQQQ calls instead. In other words never buy puts.How the fuck do you pick winners?  Everything I play bleeds for three days until I hate sell it, and then it moves up.  Don’t tell me to hold one day longer, it doesn’t work that way.All time highs for everything tomorrowPuts on MCD.

We should focus our efforts into stocks we know are favorable in terms of short float.  Buy shares (not on margin) and wait 3-ish months.  Rinse and repeatTSLA recall is bullish AF. The recall only relates to the interior display screen which is not manufactured by TSLA and therefore is clearly a red herring that in fact highlights the manufacturing components actually produced by TSLA. 

But, perhaps the most compelling reason I find the recall to be bullish is bc stocks only go upIt’s shocking how autistic so many people in this sub are, we have been HEAVILY pushing GME for a long ass time and there are people around here who waited until the complete high today to finally buy in. Like if you had an inkling to get in why in the world would you wait until the price doubled to do so. I applaud you all who got in at 38Should I send gme at open?

QUIT PLAYING GAMES WITH MY HEARTAnyone know Burry's cost basis on his GME shares? I think he bought pretty much at the bottom of 2019, if I remember right, so that would be 3.30. He has 1,700,000 shares. so if we take 31.30-3.10=28 then 28 x 1.7 mil we can see that Burry made 47,600,000 off of just GME! I wonder if that covers his unrealized Tesla Losses... lolImagine if ARK IPO’d SpaceX

If tomorrow is down, the play is CSP's.First time I tried to masturbate, I kept rubbing and rubbing until I felt a little bit of sensation and pissed everywhere. Thank god I was in the shower.

Stay hydrated, go for a walk, listen to some vibin tunes. And above all else GME 75 EOWim usually supportive of the mods on this sub, but shame on them for banning people for mentioning the lucid motors spac ticker yesterday randomly and with no warning whatsoever for "pump and dump" after allowing it all throughout the day.

Seriously. That was bush league.  

OK now off the soapbox: moves tomorrow are to rotate a lil out of NIO and maybe buy some calls on that aforementioned ticker now that options are open although the premiums are so friggin' high right now.Check 😤 mate 😤 Melvin

Thanks to the future retards out there who are about to torch your GME gains in 2021.AAPL 150 tomorrowThe fact that Tesla ain’t taking hard means we 🐂 🐂Guys listen. I’m super gay for Elon. Massive TSLA fanboy, I drive a Model 3 and mostly paid for it with TSLA FD calls. Here’s the thing

After a TSLA run up it tends to trade flat for 1-3 weeks. Occasionally it dumps bigly. Result is always the same, it will be flat/down for a couple weeks, then it will have a meme sun run again. It’s easy to tell when the meme run is starting. As soon as it jumps like 5% in an hour on a random Monday, THAT’S when you get in. But you HAVE to get out of your FD’s as soon as the momentum is gone or you will get fucking rekt. Trust me. As of yesterday, the momentum is gone. But it’ll be back.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 and 횬호너ㅓ온ㅍWhen you let the intern take charge of the futures quotesSup dudes,

So, i went to horseshoeing school in Missouri. The owmer of the school had a huge handlebar moustache, like Yosemite Sam and a huge belt buckle, cowboy hat and boots. 

One day come up to me to critique my work. He said:

"Hey Boston, you're doing great, but youre not taking your time to fully understand the material. Let me tell you an old cowboy story, and you cant get back to your work.."

"Ok, Boss" i reply. 

“Well,” he says, “the Young Bull and the Old Bull are standing on a hillside overlooking a pasture full of cows. The Young Bull is prancing around, all excited, and says to the Old Bull,

 ‘Let’s run down there and fuk some of those cows(bers)!’

The Old Bull just shakes his head. 

‘Nah,’ he says. 

‘Let’s walk down there and fuk all them cows(Bers)!'"

I remember this now and it makes me thonk about trading. Average into and out of positions. Keep your eye on only a few cows (stonks) so that you can determine how they move. And when you got a read on one, fuck it to death.

Without getting into the details, a group called Melvin Capital are balls deep in puts in the low 20s that expire at the end of the week and coming weeks. So they have to buy back to cover their shorts soon. Their problem is 20% is held by the board of GME. 20% is held by institutions. Basically, Melvin might be having a stroke right now. If you can hold for another week, you’ll see a lot of upside.

If you don’t buy the dip before buyden presser, you must hate moneyTrump knows he’s in deep shit cause he’s never sounded less retarded than this new videoIn 2018, I bought ZS first IPO'ed, JD when it was only $32, MTCH when it was only $35, ICLN at $9, SHOP at $115. Now ZS is $211, SHOP at $1200, ICLN at $34, and JD at $90. But of course, I had to sell them all to start trading IN WEED STOCKS OF AUGUST 2018. Now I'm at 95% loss since then, but if I had stuck to traditional investing or at least trade options in value companies rather than speculative stuffs, I'd be likely and very solidly a multi-millionaire now.  lmaoooo

fuckWhere’s the recap guy? I miss him. I want his official recap of this epic day.fucking put in a limit-close for Feb 19 35c on GME. I have never been so depressed from making 200% gains...i had originally set the limit GTC close to 7.50 (bought at 1.70) but thought it was too unrealistic and planned to roll them into April. Had no clue the squeeze would happen this soon. Bought a 2D (this friday) 40c FD just incase this squeeze fucks Melvin so hard that he hangs himself with his own prolapse. Calls on $ROPE for Melvin⚰

Lets see if the GME gamma prints so I can roll a big chunk into april, and sell a shit ton of naked puts. 

*mandatory GME rockets🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀✋GME QUESTION✋: To anybody that actually knows what they're talking about;
Shouldn't we be going for puts eventually? My logic is the short squeeze will end, and the price will go down. So what should the move be if we're fucking idiot scum and didn't buy GME? Buy puts at the peak of the summit?Who here was on /b/ back in the day where we’d prank local GameStop’s asking if they had battletoads?Imagine not holding mad renewable energy positions right nowEveryone should be subscribed to u/deepfuckingvalue yt channel

Red flag?I meet a girl once and she said she was like a psychic. She told me I would work from home eventually and that it was where I was most happy. 
  
Well at the time she knew I was in school for a career where it’s not typical to work from home. So what she said came out of left field. 
  
I laughed it off at the time yet here I am 4 years later working from home.With the number of stim they’ll be pumping out this year, it’ll probably lead to UBI, honestly.Missing out on all these gains is making me want to seppukuI saw a commercial on CNBC for the Lucid Sedan and realized I'm not missing the boat this timeI doubted GME the entire time, but I can’t help but be happy that so many of you guys made a shitload of money today.

All of the “sell” comments are always highly upvoted and tons of people commenting in agreement. 

Just a lesson in being confident in your plays. If you feel comfortable, don’t fucking hesitate.The fact that the vast majority of people who bought GameStop today were new buys and not shorts covering is beyond belief. This squeeze is going to be unrealSo with all the "stimulus" being printed (including what was just announced), they could've given everyone over the age of 18 \~$50,000.

Like its nice to make money, but sometimes I wish I could go back in time where I was oblivious to the world of trading and stonksIf the market is an MMO, WSB raided GMETechs opening red. Green by eodBanks have somewhere between 1/2 and 1/4 of gme shares as hedged vs their short calls and today sure looked like a gamma squeeze - banks reducing short as puts went oom, then buying stock to hedge calls as they went itm... so they may own half the shares!!

The problem is that when we sell our calls, they’ll sell those shares, and 17m shares (on 70m total shares outstanding) of in the money calls expire Friday. If those calls aren’t sold and are exercised, it’s a bunch of bag holders long shares and most people would rather sell their massively gained calls for other oom calls or options on other stocks. Could be brutal Friday and into next week, going to position short and ride it down the other way.

Again - it would appear the banks need to sell at least 1/5 of all gme shares outstanding (!!!!!) by Friday assuming normal dumping of itm calls. And if that moves the price, they have to sell yet more to hedge longer duration puts and sell-hedge longer duration calls. Stock went up 60% because banks bought a shitload of stock today because they had to.Tesla will kill tm but hope SPY rips up in hopes of stimulus and AAPL finally breaks past 131 lmaoWaiting on the old classic SPY calls to printWait, you guys are making money???Holding SPCE has me so excited for the morning :))))If fucking around with these FOMO stocks is too stressful just buy IWM or EEM calls for like a month out anytime they have a red day.I’m getting lucid ads in my Instagram now lolWhat tf does PLUG even do?Tuscan Raiders, when are we going to Mars?

TLDR; the recall costs less than $1/share to fix. The AH dip is $8/share because of the recall. Soon investors will figure out the $7 difference and shares will be bought up and price corrected.

So, with Biden’s energy plan announcement tomorrow, on top of price correction to come, on top of TSLA’s fomo, and it’s one of, if not the best future company to invest in....

BUY THE DIP. Easiest TSLA play we’ve had in weeks, maybe months. If you’re bullish TSLA and and you have the opportunity to buy before the correction, do it.

The Biden team is taking a \*\*\*"shoot for the moon"\*\*\* approach with this package, one lawmaker in close contact with them told CNN, though they added that the price tag could still change."Eating frosted bears rn for cereal, wbu?Lol don't lie I know for sure one of you with puts went and looked at investing.com futures and shit your pants just a lilhonestly I should buy a peloton with all the sweet gainz they've given meIWM is fucking mooningmj or Yolo for weed etf?RKT pleas fly again

Question regarding today’s short squeeze and what’ll keep happening in the next few days:

Given that we’ve established that institutions and company insiders won’t be saving the  🌈🐻by selling their shares, given Jimbo’s call for GameStop’s board to issue new shares in a capital raising attempt, has anyone taken a look at how many more shares GameStop’s board is currently authorized to sell to the market before they need to call a shareholder meeting? 

Just wondering how safe we will be in terms of capitalizing on the short squeeze in the face of dilution but I def buy the narrative that the company would be better off waiting for a higher price before issuing more shares in a capital raise. Just wondering if anyone has an idea in order to calculate what the possible dilution could bring the current share price down to.

Cathie Wood Could Be Launching A Space Exploration ETF

1/13/21, 11:03 PM
January 13, 2021 05:03 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News

One of the most popular names in the investing world for 2020 was Cathie Wood. The ARK ETFs were among the top-performing ETFs in 2020 and have become widely followed by retail traders.

What Happened: On Wednesday, Ark Investment Management filed an offering for the Ark Space Exploration ETF under the symbol ARKX.I'm honestly sad that $20 2/19 was the highest and earliest call option available 😢See See Ivy at $18, too bad you sold it because some greaseball decided it wasn't allowed on his subreddit... 🤡🤡In the fortunate position of 1. Owing a shit ton of cap gains and 2. Literally all of my positions are mooning.Everyone talking about churchill but they don't know about peter thiel btwn. They speed racing each other to 20Its crazy, I made more than I'm expecting for my annual bonus today, and all I had to do was sit on my ass and watch it happen.So you're sitting in front of your screen, cheeto dust all over your fingers like always, wondering why Canoo is moving up on the apple talks that didnt amount to much. . .apple wanted to buy Canoo but didnt, so why the big hype?  

This quote summarizes the whole sentiment behind it:  

[“Apple values innovation, and Canoo is the most innovative EV startup in the world”](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/01/apples-interest-in-canoo-underscores-why-goev-is-a-winner/)Jumia :)for real though why are these SPACs jumping afterhours?If TSLA coudl just get bakc to 880 that would convince me to stick around and help raise the kidsWHAT DO I BUY

Edit: congrats to GME holders, wish I was big smart like you folksShort percent of float for SPCE is 74.67%Whats the psth news? Got 3 grand kn callsI'll preface this with the fact that I'm still GME gang.

Can someone tell me why people think the GameStop squeeze isn't over. average volume is 8.6 mil, today is 144m, last reported short interest was 71 mil. There was twice as much volume as what it would take to cover every single short. The highest large volume puts were at 24$ . Price peaked at 65ish million on volume, which would be about where the large shorts would have finished covering.

Yeah, I'm still GME gang, it's still solid on fundamentals, but the squeeze is almost undeniably done, no? Maybe a smaller one when the last few shake out, but I can't see how it's not over. 

Also, people realize that IborrowDesk isn't all available shares right? Every single major short could have covered without making a noticeable dent there depending on how they went about it.LIMIT UP

LMAOGot to wet my beak on that GME squeeze todayIF we are in a bubble. Can y’all think of a better target than peloton(PTON)? Tesla would be the other option but way too risky. PTON crossed into a 50 billion market cap today.I want to increase my GME position, would it be better to buy 100 shares at open tomorrow or sell a 1/15 put?Curious, is there a reason no one has DD solar winds? I get that they are in the shit for having hacked software, but they just came out and confirmed that their method of distributing was standard as used across the industry. The stock has basically halved and it’s a cyber security company. As /u/deepfuckingvalue says pay attention to plays that have bad headlines but where the tide can turn.

>“While I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today this is much like the chicken and egg question,” Dusaniwsky wrote, adding that he believes long buying led to short covering, rather than the reverse.

>Dusaniwsky doesn’t expect a big drop in shares shorted over the next few days, noting that short sellers lost $968 million in 2020 mark-to-market losses. Instead of getting out, short sellers actually increased their positions.

THIS IS THE TOP. RUN WHILE YOU CANWhat we think Tesla opening tomorrow at?**tl;dr: What are you going to do with your TSLA calls given the optional "recall?"**

Quick question for folks who have TSLA calls. There is a recall on older model Teslas. The stock dropped like $11 (1.34%) after hours.

From CNBC :

* The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked Tesla on Wednesday to recall more than 158,000 of its older Model S sedans and Model X SUVs, due to touchscreen failures.
* The recall effects 158,716 vehicles made by Tesla, representing around 10% of the company’s total vehicles produced through the end of 2020.
* The glitch is related to a memory device within the media control unit of older Model S and Model X Teslas-- the device has a limited write cycle, and stops working well over time.

This is the result of a formal investigation by the NHTSA into the same problem last June.

The Wall Street Journal says "Tesla doesn’t have to recall the vehicles, though NHTSA said in the letter that if the car maker doesn’t take the action it has to provide an explanation for its decision."

This from Yahoo News: "The agency wouldn't comment beyond the letter, which is a rare step toward a public hearing and eventual legal action. Experts say the letter means that Tesla has resisted doing a recall that NHTSA feels is necessary.

“It's obvious to me that Tesla told NHTSA to go pound sand, so what they're about to get, they've earned it,” said Frank Borris, a former head of the agency's Office of Defects Investigation who now runs a safety consulting business."

I have Tesla calls. I'm glad that this so far hasn't been used. as an excuse to tank the stock price.

Anyway, my question to you guys. Is this a nothingburger? Or should we be prepared to sell tomorrow morning before the stock tanks? Everybody is on pins and needles as it is with Tesla. Every $1 drop leads to the question "Is this when Tesla goes back to $400??" and people buying TSLA puts.

Not a financial advisor or professional. However, looking at the MACD we are still below the signal line although the MACD is moving closer to the signal line albeit very slowly. At the moment (looking a month out at the stock movement) we remain bearish and can expect a slow bleed until
The signal line and MACD line intersect moving it above the signal line. In a daily basis they are still continuing to intersect which albeit very rapidly and in short order which is why you see the momentum swings. In my opinion though it’s trending in the right direction to eventually meet a bullish price. I’m seeing maybe 24 dollars being the turning point, but there’s a lot of resistance at the moment even at the current prices.Futures mooningI've seen more comments tonight than I ever have that make me think the top is inLooking at ARK's trades today.

ArkK or ICLN?Made some solid tendies on GME today, but as someone with a smaller profile I'm wondering it it's more profitable for me to execute my 4-15 $20 call rather than continuing to hold?

Better late than never.Tax man question I’ve always wondered about. Are the penalties of withdrawing from a Roth or 401k early worse than standard realized gains taxes, or the same?

For example - I put 6k in my Roth this year. I decide in November that I want to withdraw that 6k + whatever returns.

Vs

I put 6k in my standard individual trading account, withdraw in November, and ultimately pay taxes on the returns next year.

However my puts were up most of the day and at the end they surged even more.  

I know the IV really determines the pice of the option however if the price of the stock rises by that much the most I could expect is to be flat or a tad up but def not have the puts appreciate by over 20%when will we know if today WAS shorts covering or not?fuck yeah Cathie pumping $SQ FINALLY!

https://www.caranddriver.com/news/amp33482352/sony-vision-s-prototype-testing/[deleted]So for GME, if the margin calls tmrw AM aren't as damning as we expect they will be, do we see a dump due to the failed short squeze?anyone playing apha earnings?Recall? Bullish. Tsla 900 eow confirmed.I was thinking of a hustle, don't know if it would be feasible in reality though.

Have 2 companies owned by the same entity pooling money basically. Company A buys houses via residential mortgages. Company B issues the mortgages and then sells them off to be packaged into securities. 

repeat the following basically many time over:

Company A takes out a 500k mortgage from Company B and buys a house in cash. Company B sells the debt (3.5% on 500k for 10 years) for 500k+, either directly or packages into an MBS (although maybe they have to sell to freddy/fanny to make it into AMBS?). Company B then shoots 500k back to Company A to prepay the entire mortgage. Company A sells the house for 500k or maybe it appreciated a little during this time - company A is a real estate company so doesn't really incur much broker fee. Or company A just sits on the house as an investment property.  Company B pockets the difference between the nominal amount of the mortgage and the amount it was sold to bondholders for. 

Bondholders here incur a loss due to the convexity of mortgage backed securities when they essentially get scammed after being sold a bond with expected interest payments priced in but then it is immediately prepaid and yields 0 interest.I wonder if Cramer got together with some old bodies and came with a plan to throw a little hint into a rumor that they know isn’t true. His pals sell a lot of call with insane IV and then cash out when it comes out that lucid won’t be the company being acquiredJumia. Yes their earning this report should be extremely good.

Reason is most of us will have ITM Friday calls will entirely or partially sell them instead of accept share delivery. When you sell that call to a dealer they promptly sell gme stock to hedge. 17m shares of calls jn the money expire Friday. Lots of selling.

And dealers have a lot of other long stock hedge. They May own half the company at this point. Today was an epic short squeeze and gamma squeeze but Friday can easily be the opposite. What goes up 60% on technical factors like that can also go down just as fast. Vol underpriced for this eventuality.Implied volatility is fairly low on GME this combined with the huge spike in its price is making me want to buy some puts.You a simp if you like Cathie WoodI betrayed WSB on GME. So, no tendies for me. I had 50 shares at 17 that I sold for loss after earnings.https://lichess.org/Iln6ADky comment your name plsWho else is waiting for next correction before enteringWhat happens if I own stock at $100, set a stop loss at $90, but over night my stock gaps down to $88 

Does it never sell? Or does it sell at 88How tf did u guys know GME was gonna do that lol some have been talking about it for months[deleted]i think this stimulus is going to be weak af and we go flatshould i sell tesla[deleted]I've never invested before but I am going to start. I am poor so I am only starting with $100. What is the best site/app for me to use as a beginner? I know Robinhood is popular, but I made an account years ago and don't have access to the phone number anymore so I had to contact support. It might take them a while to get back to me but I wanna get started ASAP. Any advice on an app/website that is good for beginner, low cash investing would be appreciated. Thanks!I'm purchasing puts on ICLNTesla 800 p 


U love to see ithousing market crash in MarchMight be a good time to short gmeYou all suck Cathies juice on this sub. IrritatedTSLA back to sub $400. RIP to all the teenagers who got in this week after taking financial advice from Joe from Waste Management.Looks like many of you are ready to dump GME and yolo into a literal rocket etf ARKX 🚀🚀🚀💰💰💰✊✊✊What is FDHey guys, I think I messed up.... I went to buy GME calls... but I think I ended up selling them... I wanted to buy 1/15 GME 25c... I realized I fucked up when my friend showed me I recieved a credit... I sold 15 1/15 GME 25c.... is there anything I can do?TSLA -6% tomorrowIs the House allowed to impeach Trump again for the lolz or do they need to wait for a Senate trial first?Imagine thinking the earth is round 🙃Puts on GMENo way GME goes up tomorrow... right?This subreddit is nothing but a hivemind now, is there a way to filter out the GME and PLTR manchildren? I feel like they're the worst culprits and for some reason form emotional attatchments to stocks. On RES the filter just makes the comment darker but I still see it, I don't want to see it.Why did ICLN moon?TSLA loosing steam due to people chasing cheaper and more affordable memes Imo + fomo building on other tickers

Will be in $700’s soon 📉

Positions: Closed all TSLA puts I sold. Not in TSLA anymore

Edit: I hope I’m wrong TSLA boys, not tryna hate just throwing out my thoughts.I can’t take all these GME gains porns..this market is rewarding idiots yoloing on meme stock instead of good DDs.sooo uhhh interest rates are going upGME 20 EOW[removed]Does anyone have a real reason why GME is going to be worth anything in 5 years? Something like 70% of game purchases are digital and growing, with Microsoft owning Xboxes digital market place, Sony owning Playstations, and PC being split between Steam, Epic, GOG, Amazon and about a thousand smaller competitors. Even if Chew boy captures 100% of physical disc purchases, he is going to be losing share to digital purchases year after year. I mean, both Microsoft and Playstation have console without a fucking disc reader. 

There is literally a 0% chance GME makes a reasonable dent in digital purchases, and no one is buying physical games anymore. Over the next year or two GME is going to be a few dozen stores in highly urban areas barely making a profit and an innefectual unused online marketplace out priced and too late to the game to compete with the big boys. I see this as nothing more than some cowardly shorters giving up on a squeeze short term to a few autists and some empty hype.I have a few gme puts. For obvious reasons.
It WILL come down. There's no legit, long term reason it will stay as high as it is. All yall bulls enjoying your big gains, which is great, congrats. But how much are you willing to lose if you don't take your profits now. Just wish incould have gained on the ups, but im happy to gains in the downs. Gains is gains fam. Adios.Who is dumping at least half their Tesla shares tomorrow 🙋🏻‍♂️So GME Gang: you buying puts?
Edit: yo you autist, i was just asking. If you sell your calls/shares might also make some money when gme goes down[removed]We need TSLA AT $600My stalker doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. Ghosted me. Said she gets too attached. Only me 🙄Sell TSLA. Bubble confirmed. I’m serious.Seems like a lot of long term investors have been pulling out the past week. Interesting. Maybe you should buy puts guys.Rip Tesla bulls.Rug pull imminentIf you could puts on GME, no matter how far out of the money it is, would the IV crush be faster than any possible gain? ie its impossible to make money when GME goes back downCan we please make ICLN the new meme stock?Lord forgive me but I'm now a gay bear on GME.I'm completely new to investing

What are some moves to make?Hello people of Reddit and Wall Street Bets. My grandson has been doing quite well in the stock market lately. He’s been telling me about these gains he’s made in a video games company of sorts. I think it was called GamePlace or something. He said he made “tenders” today, which apparently is young people talk for a shit load of money. He’s finally got himself a lovely girlfriend that does not have another boyfriend and he said that he’s well on his way to buying his first Ferrari by next year, haha. To think the kid will only be 16. Anyway, he said this was a good place to come for investment advice, especially for some quick money. I don’t think I have much time left, so I could use some quick money haha. Where do I start?So is GME still going up, or are we gonna switch to puts? Asking for a friend.holy sht Apple shot up to 139Biden I need you to say word for word

“If you have puts on GME tomorrow, you’re in good hands. GME does not belong to be this high.”

Thanks man. Appreciate it[deleted]Are you left wing or right wing? And why?When does lyin Biden speak tomorrow?people who are bagholding GME need to stop tradingShorting $GMEWe finna drill

Fuck your calls chadI have a feeling that tomorrow is gonna be a big red day.I think this % change error is a sign that we’re about to have a black swan and give you bulls one last little warm fuzzy. Let’s drillGME puts are looking kinda nice. Any thoughts?Gamestop was a good holiday play. But the holidays are overGME puts at openBlood red tomorrow.[deleted]Ngl, I want gme to wipe people out. Get fukt lmaoHonestly, I would love to see GME crash and burn. Just to see losss porn 😈Can’t wait for GME to be cut down to size. All these Robinhooders chasing the meme bout to get burned.I like how GME holders think they made the best play and they are smart! Whereas, the fact of the matter is that they just got lucky with an announcement, nothing else.Ay whatup stock gang 😂 it’s your boy Meek Millah “Meek Mill”. I been in this bitch for a minute but am just exposing myself rn! Lmao! Hold up wait a minute, y’all thought I was finish!! Lmao for real!!!!! 😎 Ay “I never fuck Wayne I never fuck Drake!” Yaaaahhh dreamchasers babyGME buyers have to be some of the stupidest people on the planet, these people are incapable of thinking of themselves and form an emotional hivemind around a stock and shit talking anyone who dares question their actions. If you knew anything about Gamestop you'd know it's a dying and soon to be dead company. Everyone who knows anything about videogames knows that physical stores are dead in the water and everyone is going digital now with no need for a middle man.I'm begging please someone tell me how/where to buy GME. Literally $1000 would change my life. I'm not even sure how I ended up here but I'm so pumped and excited for everyone who did so well today. I know I sound fucking stupid but after you roll your eyes please tell a girl what to do!You have got to be one of the best mods of any space on the internet that I’ve ever come across.

MakeMeSufferYou earned thisThank you for curing my FOMOf  :'(ouchI feel you, got out literally yesterday night (after 2 months of holding) as I tought this week was going down because the expiry of Melvin puts. Bought TSLA Saw +5% in the morning and didn't think anything of it, then +20% and was like ok wtf but focused on working, fast forward 1 hour later +60% and went all in, got out at around +80% after the peak (as I bought on margin and didn't want to end up in the red if it went below 60% again)

Lesson learned only focus on one thing at a time

Tomorrow, maybeWell both plays are pure phaggotry, if that makes you feel better?willing to bet $400 you won't make that mistake againGME is supposedly still going to pop up and squeeze moreServes you right, and thank you for your sacrafice.  Brokers have big data and know who you are. They knew you weren't worthy of the gains so literally waited to as soon as you paper handed.WSB totalgains and memes inc.Yesnot even, I am trading using my bank's website and pay $10 per transaction

still made bunch of $$$I've never invested in my life and know very little about it. I'd like to get started though. I am 100% aware that I will not become rich overnight, or next year, or probably ever. But I am an unemployed, dirt poor man with a family to support. With the stimulus check and tax season coming up, I have a few hundred I can afford to invest. I know that's not much but maybe, just maybe, I can make a little profit and slowly build it up and learn a lot along the way. What should I do to get started?Sir we are called autistsShut up you'll ruin itHere I am sitting here with negative gains on RH. I’m an idiot.Bag holding as well 💪No shit I probably would have sold yesterday. Madlad you a going to be rich as hellbe honest. do you yourself actually have 39C 1/15 and do you think they have a decent chance of printing?I don't see the problem. He's got two days. This is like \*maybe\* and outline, definitely not even a first draft stage.Not selling til $420.69

Edit: been shilling GME too much mods muted me60,000 shares after I exercised my 600 $19 options today.

I don't believe in the company, but I believe in you fucks, so I'm riding shotgun with you to the bitter or bigger end.

Or until it falls to 23Always. 💎🤲🏻. No matter what.Same here bud. Im a fucking idiot.I sold my 20c at 10am thinking I was making bigbrain gains 🤷‍♂️Our day will come.

I laughed when I saw people commenting that this was the squeeze.  We could see returns like today each day for the next 1-3 days especially if we find out there was insider buying.  LFG50 @ 25 because I'm not absolutely insane.I’ll admit I sold some PM because I wanted to divest from margin. I also didn’t expect it to pop **today**

I theta gang though I've been interested in swing tradingHow do you figure out what’s in a dip and what do you purchaseSame with larger accounts and theta gang. You can buy and sell options on good stocks you don’t mind owning.  

Pdt and buying cheap options on meme stonks is the hard way to win for sure manIf its easy to 5% a day then it doesn\`t really matter what you start with!

Start with £1000 do 5% a day for a year, easy you say, see what you have at the end of it.5 dollars is like, a hundred times more than 5 cents. Whoa. 

🤯Yes, but I love the feeling that I myself am my own maker. I wouldn't want the money if it wasnt hard earnedCareful man. The losses are bigger tooDo you run the wheel and what is 6 considered 6 figures?

Let's see your $330,000 return this month.[deleted]I have like negative 10% cashAmen. I'm astounded that more people don't realize what the Fed and the government has actually done to the dollar.

The production cost hasn't meaningfully changed, you dollar is just worth less than it was yesterday.can't lose value if you don't have dollarsLol I currently have 122k in marginExplainCan someone explain margin and why this is the case?Nice plays king. I think P A V E is also a good play for the infrastructure billYeap we’ve gone downhill at an ever increasing pace.

Sold BABA 230p 2/19 to finance a calendar feb/March 300c.

Call spreads on Apple for earnings

LWBG leaps financed selling a strangle 17.5/35 for febGOEV: I tried riding the baby train with two calls, bought high, sold low, watched it rebound to where I bought.

APHA: Bought 5 12.50 leaps (01/'22). No doubt that will pay off, we'll see if I regret the entry.

RKT: Patiently waiting....still waiting. (13 June '21 21c, currently ITM), plus 100 shares. 

KTOS: Rode the best part of that wave, sold last contract today early, made money on all contracts (sold the others yesterday).

Now GME? I won't touch TSLA, but that might be the one to gamble on, can't believe what's happened.Ok ill go. GME 🚀🚀🚀🌕APHA putsI got into GMEGay postI HAVE BEEN ROYALLY GAPED BY X, NO MORE PLZwelp I am consitently getting gaped by VALE and MT, so I'm looking forward to this.

FCEL better pop tomorrow with his speech. 

Inauguration day will rain tendies from the sky.Valehalla?This is why I keep telling folks to get in bed with VALE, CLF, and ICLN. VALE and CLF will be the big recipients to Biden's infrastructure plan, and ICLN will only grow greener as the year goes on. These are long plays, April at the earliest for most; however, patience will provide us with a nice green payday, and we can interrupt our wives and their boyfriends wrestling session to show them our gains.

See you guys on Mars 🚀🚀🚀I can’t buy the X dip anymore after today🥴I’m all in on those 2 sectorsWe are also in a climate crises Biden, don't forget!lets go joeThe fuck is TM?I will be waking up at 4:15 AM PST to see the rocket launchIs that am or pmTried to tell people to get in. Got banned for 1 day lol.You can. I get fucked all the time.Buy farther out. Don’t buy when RSI is on the moon. Fail more but learn each time.

Or put it all in GameStop idkBUY LONGER DATED SHIT YOU FUCKING CLOWN. Theta dont touch u til like 45 dteWe wait for you to sell then we pump itLearn Greeks pick low theta plays usually a few months out but you gotta not pick shitty stockshold one day longerGet in on some of these ETFs and long play, also just make a rule to not hype buy unless you legit feel like you got in early.dont play weeklies or buy less so the 3 day losers dont hurt enough to make you sell


also most people here dont paper hand after three daysSell puts on things you wouldn’t mind picking up. If you get assigned. Sell calls on it. 

Or leaps. 

If you see a ticker in here 5-10 times. Calls

When you see it 50 times. Puts. 

And etfs. At least until we get a sense of how this is going to shake out. 

Just my strategy. 

I yolo profits on lottos. Have had some nice winners. 

Also lost a lot until I found what works for me. Losing is the tuition. Hang tight.Do your own dd and trust your position. You’re not going to be green on everything everyday, shit might be red for a week before you get a profit. Have an exit point and stick to it.Piggybacking off a few others here: if you're playing options, get at least a month+ out unless you are supremely confident of your play. Even then, it's usually better to buy closer strikes with more time.Bud you serious ? It’ll be ok1.  Get credit card

The problem with bubbles is when it finally pops everyone thinks they are buying the dip but then it just keeps dipping, they buy more, it keeps dipping, and in a matter of weeks you’re wiped out. Experienced it first hand during the c.r.y.p.t.o bubble of 2017/18. This will end the same for most of this sub.Already filmed the landing in a Hollywood basement.What's the symbol kind sirIts not confirmed yet tho right? Still bought them anyways 🤣 i ride with my retardsI did some digging after I saw it being throw around and felt the vibe. My calls printed AH. Excited to see what I wake up to.I sold at 14.60. Good times.GMLess risk. Long term more exposure. Why own ARKK and not Tesla?BlasphemyI used to say this about iwm and it's fucking up 25 percent pre covidSoon you'll amass a portfolio with all these booming stonks and then you too will have essentially a clean energy etf. And then you will wonder why do I have all my money in 5 stocks when i can have 1 booming stonkIt's an ETF lmao and had back to back 8% gains when Dem's won Georgia (that's crazy for an ETF). Expect this etf to do extremely well over the 6 months, esp when Biden actually announces his plan, etc.It’s the safe play for green energy, as QCLN is. It’s an ETF, WSB expects it to moon like a meme stock.You're in for some free money.💎🙌🏼90 eowSomeone bought a fat stack of $40 calls for Friday https://i.imgur.com/Rm5oOdR.jpg100 EOYYou’re good Boss.Same. We’re both good. I ain’t selling.Practically all of WSB is rooting for at least 36.Sorry man*everybody missed this joke*same day onlyI think it’s about a year as a minimum. I use the term with anything over 6 months thoughNo you just jump over the first expiry date on Robinhood aka u leap over the first oneA month of two is a pretty good leapsIf you are not gambling, never, ever buy options that expire in under 60 days. Once they get to 30-35 days left to expiry, close the position and buy again for a further expiration date. Don’t hold them with less than 30 days left, again, if you aren’t gambling2 weeks is close as hell lol.Leap is a year or greater, I believe.1 yearThink it's anything over a yearWhat?  Why would you do that?

Are you bagholding?Always has been...I would be tooLol why dude they just hyped it up for today and tomorrow will probably will be sell off dayWell how many shares?37.me tooDon’t be. Tuesday to Valhalla. No paper hands.hopefully only one shareHow do you fucking sloths wake up so late? I see comments like these all the timeGME more likely to hit $950 than TSLAAren't you the guy who wouldn't eat out the fatty because her cooter smelled like cheeseburgersLet us know before market open tomorrow morning. TIA!Wait, isn't it as simple as: what am I thinking today? Okay, do the exact fucking opposite! 

Literally can't go tits up!Maybe don't go into something after 5 consecutive green days? Just a thought.Sounds like you're jumping in after multiple massive runs.

Try doing it for stuff with just an initial run.Buy at the top

But do it before it's at the topI only caught Plug, bought in at 20$ and am still holding. Have you sold already?Lmk what’s next because I’m have the inverse effectthey were 500% at the peakA nice house. Serious think about it. 300k house paid off completely. Only bills are utilities. You can live off of 300-500 a month. You can quit your day job and walk dogs or some laid back chill shit with 0 cares in the world cause you got a roof over your head permanently. 

And it's also like a stonk cause it gains value over time so if its time to yeet you're yeeting with a profit.Sports team?I bought a nice ass new truck I owe nothing on, finished paying off my house (I’m 29) and bought a new drift boat. Moral of the story is buy the things that matter to you and then kick backReally old cheese or wine. Or onlyfans socksRichard Mille watchesBuy an AMG bruhIf you don''t mind me asking, what did you start with investing and how much of your networth is from stonks?Happiness?Buy an entire fuckin fleet of seadoos and a double decker trailer that holds em all.

Once the new presidency is settled, and especially if covid news gets too stale and goes away, its possible that climate change will become the main star again

Obviously America loves to hear news about our self-perpetuated doom, and green energy/solar/electric vehicles could be the rotation for that news cycleWhat about a longer term perspective than this week? I’m guessing you see potential if you haven’t sold yetBig upsiesyupi have 10 grand in MT calls

smhSame but my calls are a bit further out. Steel gang shall rise againI blame Robinhood LOL f themiv crushThe premiums are insane on GME. End of week near the $$$ options would need to move 20% for you to break even on a straddle basically.i did a straddle for an hour today on GME but then got too nervous and exited both positions for a lossI’m a newbie with options (or rather I’m a europoor and can’t trade them). This is obviously a very good hedge. What would the downside be if say it goes one way or the other and one becomes worthless and the other rockets up? Can’t someone theoretically do this for every trade?> You can buy both puts and calls on GME. It’s called a straddle or a strangle depending on the strike prices.

That's all I knowThere are a ton of positions expiring Friday. Couple with tons of other factors mentioned numerous times on numerous DD posts, GME has potential to push past 40 or even 50 tomorrow. The squeeze is just starting.Think about how many times TSLA has exploded and everyone debates whether or not to FOMO in the next day and then it still grants people life changing money.

That was just excitement, this has hype + actual technical reasons why it will continue to explode.There is a 100% chance many of the buyers today have no idea what IV is.

You could get unlucky and join right at the end. It’s a risk you have to take. I’ve seen tons of ppl think they’re too late, and they miss out on weeks and months of constant gains.

Stripping in law school, not a big deal. Stripping as ur secondary job to something that requires a public persona. Could damage the brand.Most will YOLO it on something stupid and lose it, lets be honest.

That's too retarded for even us.The store buys it from Heinz. So it’s a sale.Their 500k delivered meant an end user purchased themTsla’s business model is direct to consumer, so the dealers are not separate businesses like traditional car dealers. Aka the car hasn’t changed hands until it reaches the consumerThis gets into the details of revenue recognition for accounting *shiver*Where is this? Tesla doesn’t have dealerships.They Dont have dealerstesla sells direct to consumer it has no dealerships.  if a tesla delivery center is flush with cars those are waiting to be delivered to those who bought themBasically that means that your car has been dropped off at the store. And is waiting for you to pick it up. Tesla doesn’t use car dealership they are direct to consumer.Hopefully it included buying lucidI had the same dream... timestamp buddiesSoftIt's not a bug. USA is now called Zimbabwe 2tbh depends on the paper hands. either way itll recover eventuallyYour fucked cuz all the attention is now on GME so TSLA might not get any pumping soonA recall doesn't mean they lose sales. A recall means they offer to fix the shit for free.


In this case, it could just be an over the air update, or replacing a memory module for a fairly cheap cost to the company.


I cant imagine this actually impacts anything during market hours.? What you talking aboutWorth between 1 and 10 dollarsExpiry?You’d think not a big deal. It’s like maybe $350mm for a company that’s raised $10B+ recently. Who knows though, would be equally unsurprised to see it moon anyways or eat shitWhat they do raise some cash?Depends. You’re trying to lose it right?Factor in cap gains tax, unsure if you bought in Jan 20 but if you bought between then and now you’re most likely going to pay 2x ST cap gains tax as I assume gme wouldn’t be a long play.roll it into the next TSLA.

I promiseYou won’t make the gains people today did, but I don’t think it’s too late to make some profit. If the short selling really hasn’t ended yet, there’s still a chance to get in. Look at DASH today. People thought it was time to short yesterday and it still reached a new ATH today.It will squeeze up to $100+. Only about ~10% of the shorts has been covered...If the bull thesis is correct, it wasn't just talking about a 1 day pump to $30, only to crash afterwards.

me autisct tho....it's not a bad idea. strategy that has worked well in the past for me is buying spy calls 4-5 months out at close, selling the next day at open. historically, spy gaps up about 80% of the time. and with calls that far out (don't necessarily need to be leaps) almost no theta burn if you're wrong and willing to hold an additional dayI haven’t BBC yet eitherYesBecause it’s undervalued as shitshort squeezes incomingLady Cathie75 daysI have five $10c 1/15 that I got for 9 cents each that will absolutely print if ENG somehow has another big day.I asked this once.

I'm optimisticShort sellers were down $812 million in mark-to-market losses for the day, according to S3’s Dusaniwsky.

“While I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today this is much like the chicken and egg question,” Dusaniwsky wrote, adding that he believes long buying led to short covering, rather than the reverse.

Dusaniwsky doesn’t expect a big drop in shares shorted over the next few days, noting that short sellers lost $968 million in 2020 mark-to-market losses, Instead of getting out, short sellers actually increased their positions.That’s the idea ain’t it but 🤷🏻‍♂️It will be a boost to all commoditiesWhy ?NeverHell nah TSLA only goes up youll brush off those red days and never look backIt went up 4.5% in AH.

If IV dies down, long dated calls sound good otherwise shares is the safer route I think.https://imgur.com/a/u4jRycY

Chart is looking a little bearish, but given current events this could easily swing the other way especially since the MACD has been below the signal line for a while. It’s patterning down based on 1 month view, but could reverse. RSI indicates it’s not overbought. Not a financial advisor or professional but I predict a bearish morning maybe drops to 90 light swing up tomorrow to 92-93. Not a recommendation to buy or sell.

Notice the MACD trended above the signal line for a moment this month which could be a bullish sign.How that stock still gets bought is beyond meBy proxy.

Then it went parabolic... 

Then some shorts were covering I've no doubt..

Just the beginning.There are literally 1000 posts about itNeeds a catalyst too.the way i imagine it, theres a lot of big players in on gme starting today, so retail investors are playing against more than just melvin/shorters.

i think its pretty likely a bunch of us retards bought calls from mm's today, they keep it flat for a bit to iv crush the shit out of call holders, then let it moon and reap the profits of holding actual shares.

or maybe it just hulks out immediately, who knows? idk how to check how many new call positions were opened up and sold today.R/investingYou close the position for whatever P/L?rough day for me mostly, but got a couple AH runnersI think it pops when they announce stimulus/infrastructure plan hopefully tomorrowSecurities will be bought and sold.

If you don't do either of those things, sell it on Friday.

Then turn off options trading, learn the Greeks, learn how options work, and come back and try again.Well hope to god GameStop hits 40You should have sold today, at least do basic DD about options before dumping money in. If GME is under 40 (likely a little higher) all your money will evaporateHold til Friday afternoon ✅✅✅You’ll be fine. We’re gonna blow past 40 and you can find a exit that you’re comfortableThats a short time frame for 40, I’d exit that tomorrow if I were you. (Maybe wait until noon to see if it goes up)Bro youre fucked why would you buy so far otm expiring so soonYou should just stay committed at this point. It a literal lotto ticket now.

If it gets profitable at any point between now and eod Friday sell it and then go learn about options, theta, IV, and the other Greeks.Sell them and buy further out. Id wait til around 1030 to decide if it was me. Unless of course it shoots off like a rocket, at which point...

GME: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀WSB is a bank?I think so yawell it’s a fucking index fund lolI was surprised when I saw it getting spammed on wsb, it's literally in my boomer portfolio.Last week it was boomin so it’s just taking a little napI hold it for the sole reason that my 401k only lets me trade ETFs.It's almost up 200% on the year what are you talking about.It’s an etf...I coat them$1200 got us a three month rallywhy would futures help TSLA when Tech is redMy friend says they r fukspace stonkNoCathie Wood & space hypeexplanation:  BUY🌝 🚀 🚀an ETF with space companies in itBUYit’s like the space force of stonksAre you seriously this retarded?$1,200 before the 10 to 1 split next Thursday. Dr.PP messages me privately with insider information32.80Bruh I'm not sure but I think that's illegalRight here SECYou’re kinda obsessed with COVIDDo itI bought two, just to see if I get luckyI'm no expert but if you sell premiums then you miss out on any future leaps past the strike price, if you exercise the option then you just own the shares and take advantage of any upside or downside that ensuesPrice = intrinsic value + extrinsic value (which is >0)Options have extrinsic value (the purchase price of backing stock will not change) in the stability offered and intrinsic value (the difference between the strike price and stock price). If the option is not yet due to expire, it definitely has some extrinsic value in addition to the intrinsic value and therefore may not be worth exercising compared to the sale price. Timing for dividends and/or taxes will also impact your value difference between exercising and selling.As far as I could tell depending on how much the premium was and how much the stock is currently at, buying 100 shares are the strike price could be way better. To some, just taking the money and running is better than gambling it again.it's coming here bitch, look at the SEC document posted todayWhy the fuck are you pumping this ticker so much bro?pump your penny stock somewhere elseSqueeze hasn’t even startedRide into the sunset...

You are complaining?Not done. Poised to short squeeze for weeks more. But yes, PLTRLol company that averages 7 billion in sales, but market cap only around 2 billion. I'm sorry GME is not done, not by a long shot. Idk why most you PLTR gangmembers don't just have both...gme is just getting started. the short squeeze isn’t over until the shorts are squeezed out.my coworker went and he was kidnapped and had to pay a ransom. be carefulare you fat or do you have any other health issues? if not then go eat tacos and if you get the rona then sleep it off.Yea I hear the cartel has eradicated the Rona....

With that said.... Tsla, pltr 🚀🚀🚀I DID sell my 1/15 24c yesterday🥴I do have, I think it’s a 50/50 chance. If this is really a short squeeze tomorrow should be a decent gap up, nobody sold and everybody is FOMOing shares at open^Exactly, analysis says this was not short covering (entirely), rather accumulation.My broke ass has 1 $30 for the same day. Hoping this will make me a little money to play with.What is 2/19?I've heard 4/16 $45c without any DD involved.I was at lunch and saw 2k go poof. Still made money though on GME. Thanks to y’all.Should have opened it at close for the morning gapI’m just looking for reassuranceThe man would've had such a fun life if he never got into office. 

Celebrities and the media liked the guy and his business antics and shows.Is it smart to buy a 1/15 call at open tomorrow if I didn't have a call before? New to this so sorry for noob questioncallsIt’s true, she’s pretty cool.No, actually it’s all true. I guess what she said was verbatim. She brought up Robinhood and Nio herself.

Hmm, unless she’s wealthy from suing people, then I may have a problemPuts on your dadThe mans Nostradamus he called a million dollar play a mile and a half awayWhy FridayWhy FridayRespect the cathie baeWhat does tsla have to do with space?New providenceBecause it is fucking easy right now, everything is fucking mooning. A couple bad trades, couple of emotional trades off the back of that and you wiped out.  That\`s how people fail.Do DD on a ton of different stonks and build a ghost portfolio of stonks you like but don't actually own. Keep these in  watch lists.

Study basic Technical Analysis to understand basic support and resistance. You don't need to understand any of this in depth, just enough to be able to have a feel for when something is at/approaching these levels.

Then just scan your watch list and see what's red and what's green. If it's red, quickly assess why it's red. Scan news headlines and comments to get a general idea. If it's an overreaction or simply profit taking I feel pretty comfortable entering a position. 

If the entry looks good (based on basic TA and your gut feeling) go ahead and open a position. 

Enter the position with about half of what you intend to use. Use the second half to dollar cost average into the position to decrease your average cost for your position and also get an idea of whether or not the trade is going your way. Keep an eye on it for a bit and either take profit immediately if it works out in your favor, or set a stop loss and check back later.5% plays are more exceptional and require more planning. Yeah if you try to 5% every play you'll probably fail. The idea is to make a ton of 1% plays and win more than you lose. You're much more likely to win 1% moves than 5%. Save the 5% moves for well-planned plays. And use stop losses.I lose money when over-confidence leads to over-leveraging. I've been humbled and blew up my smaller account a couple of times and can't imagine what it would be like to blow up my larger account. Definitely proceeding with caution.6 figures is 100k and up yes.

Only do options if you got a decent amount to throw away as acceptable losses. Don't go into debt like half the tards here. 

Shares are safe long term choices, however on days like today you'll make $300 instead of 3,000, but that's still 300 bucks a day man.

My Grandpa money is in my retirement accounts. Anything here is just playing the roulette wheel to knock years of the career.That's not an argument if the guy had 150% returns in 6 months he'd has 25 mil instead of 330k I guess you're saying he doesn't need that money or somethingThat's made up math.

Given the current environment of what seems like endless money printing, stimulus, effectively zero interest rates etc I think you’d have to be an idiot not to just stay long equities.Purchase sell puts? (since I don’t have the shares for sell calls)Calls on TULIP, got it.I went thru that 2017/18 too. Still a big believer in that but this sub ain’t the place to talk that. 

Regarding the equity markets - I feel like money has no other place to go for the most part given the current environment - endless brrrrr, massive stimulus, zero interest rates, bonds essentially zero. Why would money not want to be in equities?😂See see ivCciv 🚀🚀🚀See see I VCcivNope just massive rumors.

But it will not habe those 20% AH and gap fills that older clean energy stonks haveThere will be gainz for sure on ICLN.  But in no way is it the best clean energy play. Throw a dart at any of them and you will have more gainz.Which is great. But that 8% was only made possible by a few of its portfolio holdings mooning like 30% 

Just encourage making a clean energy watchlist with icln at the top. So you can see the movements within the sectorIm just saying, make a clean energy watchlist. Then tell me ICLN exposes you to the gains in that sector every dayI’d quit my second job honestly, only working it to pay student loansYo what app is thatEomYea this is not what I was goin for😭 kinda wholesome though that people are trying to be helpful lmaoI know you're joking but anything above 6 monthsBecause the squeeze is yet to start babyHeckCause the squeeze hasn’t even happened and I wanted to be in on it. Guh560GUH🙏Yeah. Just one...Currently still on PLUG, SOL, and PLTRI should probably just get out now and minimize the damage.  Definitely close margin since I don't wanna get calledI had 19.50 GME yesterday but sold a day early.  I do agree, at this point I'm just tilting and am trying to close the red with whatever big play I can think of.  Not really the best judgement in terms of what I'm laying money onStill holding my shares with an average of 20.40 lol.  PLTR 300 shares at 25.90.  To be fair, I had GME yesterday at 19.50 and sold at 20 something.  Literally the reason why I'm hating myself so much because I could've just held an extra day.  PLTR is the worst though.  I've been on this thing for the longest time and just kept averaging up all the way to 1100 shares selling cc's.  Today killed meGains are slow. 300k house where I wanna live is kind of a shithole too. But yes the goal is when I hit a mil to use half to buy a house.Now now, Let’s stay within reason hereDamn how much did you fucking make. 👑you had me at drift boatWtf are only fans socks 😂Geez those are nice and expensiveAMG wagon gets mad hoesOther cars I’d much rather haveStarted with 60k in April last year. 100% in stocks. It was a good year and a great start to this one.I don’t remember what the feeling isStarted in April with 60k. At 420k as of today, lol. I guess that’s what...8 months? Up over 600%?YesNo pendejo yo hablo bastanteLook bro people be asking for medium fries and I upsell them to large fries at least 50% of the time. 
**THAT’S SALES**Baconator Account Manager, MDI can be a supporter of anything I need to be when I’m trying to get the sale. Same with stocks.

Tinker Air Force base. It’s a repair base mainly.B1. Shakes the fucking house.What your rankYou good?You good?Or peak genius?  Best part about having some money to throw around is to do fun shit like this.

We all make 6 figures and we've been stuck in our fucking houses for a year.  This is as close to entertainment as we're getting right now.Why would this be the peak of stupidity? You probably thought the same thing of GME yesterday? Go back into your gaybear caveGive these white collar family fucks something to watch over the next few days.  We've all been dying for some excitement in our livesOh yah I'm definitely not discounting the possibility we get wiped outIt🚀🚀🚀🚀I’m pretty much dead right?I've got OTM ICLN leaps, just don't think we should expect the gains from last week to happen again this week, or even expect much gains this week at all, and same for next week, for the clean energy sector.[deleted]ICLN is above 6B already no?hope that starts tomorrow. i positioned my portfolio for a continued clean energy rally this week and next and so far its been massively disappointing.What strike?Why lolI think the price movement outweighs IV crush on this stock.I’ve noticed when stocks like this supernova they either keep going or they come down hard. I’m betting on a 20% move in either direction as opposed to a 0-10 in one.Lmao ouchNo real downside if it goes enough either way, but you would make less money than if you didn't make the opposite trade. (your profits of one leg, cover the loss of the other leg)

If GME doesn't move, then you can lose a good bit, since both sides would be hitting you.You can. The hope is that it moves so far in direction it outweighs the loss of the other. 

If the stock price doesn’t move and both expire worthless you lost on both sides. 

Given how much this is moving I’m in on it.It needs to rocket/die enough to overcome the high IV crush AND the other end of the strategy...Only buy in if you think GME is going to have another super moon day or it'll die so hard the next day, otherwise, you're just bleeding to death because it isn't doing anything crazy.This is the kind of dd I look for hereYou know what they say about short squeeze’s... best time to buy puts. GME may run tomorrow but it’s gonna be a roller coaster ride for the next few weeksSOLO hit my scanner all day today. Thinking about throwing $5k at it tomorrow to dip my toe in.Wrong. I have an incredibly conservative stop loss and rarely hold when I’m over 100%Yep.

Yes you are making gains, but you are essentially just clawing back a currency which will probably be -30% at some point in your life.I actually agree. I don't think anyone will dare to raise them. 

Read OP again 🤡Something about how much distance you can cover per gallon of gas.Yep they announced it. The stock moved like 2% after not moving for like half a yearCC👁VLucid Motors.I mean that is true. Sometimes even the indexes are red but the stock trades green. So I guess you are right it is a guesstimate. But I sware 9 times out of 10. Big red = i'm in danger lol. At least that is how it opens. I'm more than aware that sometimes it can open down 2% Then climb up to green in like 30 minutes. It's insane to see, i love it. Man im hard now even thinking about it.Yes, that is the information we need to know.Stock but I mean it would be the same either way lol.

It triggered the bump up of a few dollars like every Cramer mention does. Than I believe a few shorts decided it’s time to cover which gave the mega boost. GME has been strong with support levels so far and it’s been increasing every time. From $11 to $16 to $19 than $20. I see a strong $30 support but at the worst I see $27 at the lowest. 
I also don’t expect the short interest to have gone down much. After the price went 🚀 the shorts def reopened positions from the peak expecting a huge crashDo you know what market caps are?Sightly different market cap.That’s how much it ran up when the previous consoles came out. Albeit, it was short lived. People will spend a lot more on games when new consoles are out. I think it’s just a bit delayed wit the console supply issue and that there aren’t even any new games out to sell.BULLSHIT!

^^^this ^^^has ^^^been ^^^an ^^^accessibility ^^^service ^^^from ^^^your ^^^friendly ^^^neighborhood ^^^botWho knows when that is tho. It could be tomorrow, or it could be 2 months out. That 55 resistance on DKNG is heavy.Almost had the same happen here. I been playing DKNG since mid November to moderate success. Made almost 20k on it in November, but currently bag holding it for the past month. I had 40k in calls for 01/15 55c which I sold at no loss when it had that run towards 55 before dying completely 3 weeks ago. Those calls would've been worthless today, so I got very fortunate on that. DKNG been super frustrating since November tho to trade.“Old news”SameBest post in this thread. Wish everyone got it, but they are probably paper.Yeah I believe 1T is priced in currently. But if Biden really does introduce a 2T package, there will be a lot more to price in the near termNot in office but treasury notes already priced it in and futures popping off right nowYou fall into the 99%. It’s okay tho.gme has nothing to do with russellI have gold but i have 700+ in cash balance left so im not using marginim calculating using ah movement using the total day gain. literally cucking me 500 makes no senseI’m still getting used to Schwab’s platform.

You can go long or short the stock can move 25% on either direction and you wound double your money on the way up and also won’t lose it all on the way down.  

For everyone who made a killing congrats u really didn’t think I would pump as hard as it has.  Might even go much higher but it needs to retract and form a base.  I won’t even add more puts it will come to me. 

However FCEL and unlike PLUG that one really is a shitty stock and has gone up ridding the entire clean energy train and have nothing to show for themselves.  Triple down puts on that onedope, i didn’t sell but i just think considering worst case scenario is goodno, bulls are in the bull trap phaseTake
Off phase got itLooks like itLmfao what the fuck is this kid talking aboutCan you please explain how calls work. I am new to investing and I see calls mentioned all the time. TIAMy worry. My dumb ass thought earnings was AH tmI know I made 30k on GME todayI got in at 12 but sold today. 
The thing with sharing a board member is beyond a stretch since that happens all the time. The LinkedIn post about jobs for sec compliance tilted me to believe that they may actually go with a direct listing or ipo rather than a reverse merger.

Might throw a couple hundred bucks into it tomorrow then.thanksI got calls and a lot of them exp in feb which I bought at the top at around 27-28 on dec 28. Have some may calls which I bought at around 23.35c feb & march calls which I bought before the blood bath at around 27-28 on dec 28. I have a lot of these.

How much did he pay?Modelos only now.Yep. There’s something like 15m or 14m shares of selling the banks have to do end of day Friday If people dump those massively in the money calls. Sounds like a selloff to me since very few people will accept delivery of stock. They’ll instead dump ITM calls and buy oom calls or other things. Lots of selling.

Gme is like 70m shares outstanding. 15m of net selling is huge. It’s also why the stock went up so fast today.

Are mortgages being handed out like candy to the point it’s concerning? Yes. Does it really matter? Not yet. Most of the people buying homes haven’t lost a cent during the pandemic and are just taking advantage of the low rates. Sure I have wealthy clients who none of this applies to but the average middle class person who hasn’t been affected is going to be okay

The real concern or catalyst when things might head south is when the lien or mortgage/rent forgiveness is over and then people start being evicted or foreclosed on and then you see an influx of supply. But as is, the demand can’t keep up and won’t for a good while. Basically in gridlock for multiple reasons 

TMI and this isn’t directed at you, but tired of every shmuck out there saying this is just like the housing bubble. It’s notOr maybe the low interest rates made homes a lot more affordable. A simple 1% difference in your interest rate can make a huge change in your buying power.siTesla worth $8 if we being real broBut these are ITM...

Made me do a double takeMy bad. $GME $50 EOW 🌝🌝🚀🚀🚀🚀Forreal let him miss outMoons as wellI do like the idea of pivoting the entire stores into something else entirely and using the backrooms simply to ship product out of. Selling more board games, cards, and hosting lots of tournaments could be a great way to increase foot traffic, especially if they can strike a deal with someone like WOTC. The boomer investors on the board may not bite such an expensive and risky play though, overhauling all that space, and having to suddenly get liquor licenses and bartenders and such.


I fail to really see them selling different electronics would be too helpful though- radioshack proved Alibaba drop shippers and Amazon have you beat every way.Obviously gamestop was way over shorted, but I think after this rise of the weaker shorters closing their positions, there might not be a whole lot left to ride on.EaterYeah but how can you be sure volatility will decrease?

Also I’m in there! Can we get a special GME Claire. I want to stand out as retarded and unique.I’m not flexing I’m trying to get you greedy fucks to donate and what he did shut that down. 

It doesn’t matter though someone donated more after me so the ball is already rollingYes it did, no one seemed to click on your post to scroll through the posts in it everyone just went past it so you killed all the posts you lumped in there. Not a single view after it got chucked in there, people didn’t like it, please remove my post from it.

I’m not mad it’s just frustrating that you ruined something for charity.

I have no clue why you decided to put my post about a donation inbetween 90 GME gain postsI made a Robinhood acct a cpl years ago but never did anything with it. I can't remember what email I used either so I cant log in or create an account. Is there another alternative to Robinhood that is easy to use?

EDIT-I found the email. GME hit $38 today and made a lot of people rich. But it started going down again. What reason is there to believe it will go up again?Sold my 1/15 21 call yesterday 🤡Doh!1/15 40C at open tomorrow? assuming gap up isn't immediately in the morning and i can get filled at decent pricedamn imagine being able to buy calls

*cries in Australian* (no Robinhood here, I use Stake)The 19th day of FebruaryI am cash settled so it takes a day. But today put me over 25k!! Yea boi🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

33 rockets there for you my guyFear no longer my friend! I too sold at 33ish, bought back at 32, sold at 34, bought back at 31. Legit didn't know what to do. But this is NOT the squeeze. To cover all shorts takes about 2 weeks. Today was boomers getting in and a small amount of shorts covering. This is just day 1. Welcome to the showi think trump played himself with his narcissism, positive feedback loop out of controlNo, it's a terrible idea.  IV is **massive** right now you're going to pay out the ass in premium.  Buy shares.Awesome, just don’t teach her about this place! Don’t want anyone’s grandma reading the language on here, lolThat’s the day shorts will have to cover their shorts by. So they will need to buy shares at these elevated prices for them to be able to return the shares they sold :)A lot of puts expire fridayThe 1/15 contracts if some of the shorts cover to squeeze moreLots of puts expiringWhat does tsla have to do with IOT, Payment methods, block chain, and streaming media? Nothing. Yet it’s the top holding in arkw.Thank you I lost 2 grand in May from stupid options purchases and just started looking into more responsible trading for some side money.What tickers do you run the wheel on?

Is there a selection criteria or whatever the next wsb meme isI know theta gang wins most of the time, but how could you make money as theta gang on GME this week? With calls in particularShit, I sold mine (accidentally, I made a stop order higher than what I wanted). I’ll have to hope they get leaked to PLTR holders.😂Recognizing it is the first step to recovery 🤡Well that makes me feel better, but still only the winners are posting today. Our time will comeYou should’ve pushed that another weeku will be fine. It will go to 39 tomorrow famIt will catch up to youBecause that was only possible in 2020 and god willing 2021 that shit is not normal lmaoI wanna see you swing a few 100k into a single meme stock some idiot on the internet with $800 in his robinhood came up withIt really is pathetic. We're the most prosperous nation yet we can't feed our children. I used to volunteer at a soup kitchen and whenever I'd see a kid come in it would fucking break me. We could end hunger in this country tomorrow but we're more concerned with military spending and crony-capitalist deals. Sorry, I'll get off my soapbox nowHaha I believe the opposite. Christmas sales in emerging markets and Europe prob got hit hard (unlike US consumers, the rest of the world is a bit more rational and won’t get credit for things they don’t need and also increase precautionary savings at this time). 
One thing I am bullish for them is the new chips are fucking amazing (I tested a Mac Pro the other day and even the programs that were being emulated were running at ludicrous speeds). However, I think several people will wait for next iterations (denting this years sale expectation) since a lot of important software for developers and scientific programming isn’t properly supported yet. My guess is that it will take a year or so for developer to make native ARM versions and that’s when you’ll see a lot purchases of the high margins MacBook pros with dedicated gpusI looked at the past few earnings and it tends to tank. But obviously this time around there’s the impending merger to contend with. So this might have been a 🤡 playbest news I have heard all-day ✊🙏🚀I feel you, but I would encourage you to hold till next week at the earliest. China is shutting down for their New Year holidays, and that is affecting the stocks of these companies. There are also MM's impacting it, trying to get rid of the paper handers; however, there may be a fire to this smoke that is blowing, and we can see what the market will be like in the next week and a half.

If CLF and VALE continue to dip after Biden's infrastructure speech, then we may have to reallocate to new plays. 

Vito got the boot today for Market Manipulation, and I'm not sure how I feel yet on it. On one hand, I trust his knowledge and takes on the market. A lot of things are lining up for a great play here, but then there is the elephant in the room. With all the links, viewpoints, and Dad's given to us, there has not been a single post showing his positions. Like I said, I doubt he is manipulating the market; however, the lack of a screenshot to prove he backs up his speech is definitely getting to people, and I don't blame them.

Either way my man, cannot wait to go to the moon with ICLN 🚀🚀🚀Jesús Christ it’s surprising i make any moneyi pretty much did just that and im happy as a clam. There's always a way my manShort GME?It’s a high scoreGotcha.  It doesn’t let you place a limit order for extended/after hours?You’re fuckedHmm, maybeI'm sitting on the sidelines of GME now for a while, I'm just glad I sold my calls at a good price this morningSo.... Should I buy 1/15 calls tomorrow?Buy near ITM

It's a 50/50

But can be an easy 400% or 0 

FB is the most undervalued stock right now in the marketYes.This is the waySweet! I’m going to load up on itWhen does it go live?Thanks, fam ✌️Yup gotta get them tulipsYeah you’re right about all that and I don’t think the party is ending anytime soon but I also don’t see how we can possibly keep the pace we’re at.  Algos and institutions control the market and at some point they are going to pull the rug on retail.I heard today that Lucid also opened up some SEC, and stock market related positions in their company, looking more likely tooOther thing is IV on the individual stocks is crazy high.  Like everything else you listed is at 140-150% for at the money a month out and ICLN is 75%.  

That’s a lot of IV for an ETF but relative to its holdings it’s IV is much smaller.  Yes you get stuck with some shittier companies in the holding but you get to ride the bigger holdings at a cheaper cost.Thats cuz they have tesla as the big holder or theyre in only one type of energy (eg TAN is only solar), too much in one basket for meHmmm you could be right. But also just look at the past performance of it as well. In a month it has risen 9 dollars. That's pretty darn good, especially if u got in a bit early with a shit ton of calls (mine are up 100%, i'm sure others are 200 - 300%). U can say plug brought it up, but eventually it'll go down and those other holdings that went down will go up as well.Unusual WhalesYea it went right over my head lol. But I didn’t want you buying 2 weeks calls thinking you’d be safe.GME peaked today with 100% gain.

Holding during a 50% drop makes zero sense.Well you’re already holding those bags lol but what are you buying tmrw? 😂I mean those are all winners.  Hope you have shares thoughI bought XLM (last week?) at 0.12 and sold at 0.16 thinking i made some good cash, only to miss the moon to 0.42 one day later 

Also, im very new to this sub. What the fuck happened to GME and why is everybody so emotional about it?No way!? 😂

I always thought the E63 wagon was fire but Highkey thought girls would think it’s v 🌈Then I’d buy some MDMA and jerk off.Big time! Congrats!De donde eres carnal?Your store has led the region in biggie size upsells, Mr.... Assistant Shift Manager!!! 🥳.

Congratulations, son.that's a skillOk... was about to plan on buying SPY PUTSI can only imagine.  Saw/heard a U2 take off once, sounded like a space shuttle taking off.

Holy shit this is the best description of life this last year I've heard.

Obviously - same.Are you confident that any of them won't hold it against you if they lose their capital?Imagine having enough capital to take advantage of trends and make money.  Stay in school and one day you can get a big boy job too!Wow you are retard. Can't wait for people like you te get wiped out. Will probably happen in less than 6 months anyway.doBetter off jerking off to your sister.😔Bro it has a market cap you fuck wad check it. I understand it’s an etf so it doesn’t have a valuation you fucking retard. Get out of here with that normies bullshit get a flair you dumb shitOn RH it says so I guess but not TOS. Regardless it’s going upjun18 30c

im retardedDelisted MT on MondayTrackingCashier at tendie townYou can look up my posting history to see if I'm serious or not.
I also have another account where my YOLOs are even greater.Yes. (Is that what you want to hear?)Fair enough, you do you my dudeIt’s not priced in?Lmao I respect it. The cars look dumb as fuck though.Ya why outsource when you can have Detroit ghetto slave labor 🤣Deep sea?They write shit code you’ll be fineDude any retard could’ve made money this year. I made $30,000 day trading Amazon all day (no PDT) and I’m very conservative with money lmao she literally puts her positions out for the public to pump. It’s not going to beat passive funds in your 20 years.My overall portfolio is 75% VTI, 20% VXUS, and 5% stock picking/options/day trading to scratch that itch. I’m very happy with this.They're serious yeah, but they're also fucking retarded. I couldn't in a million years see GME, as a mainly physical retailer, have enough success to scrape past MAYBE $60. 

But the fact it came this far makes no sense, also look at retard strength stocks like TSLA, PLUG etc. 

Anything is possible in this RobinHood timeline now.Yes, and there's a million GME DD posts on this sub that explain it more than I'm going to.Yeah they would be but IV is crazy high right now so you’ll be losing money when it calms down. Leaps are fine if you are deadset on calls but I still recommend shares😂 I dunno if you’re joking or notWell... that's why your account is gone. Stop gambling.Yeah it is , gme weeklies would have printed but they could have also gone to 0 like every other week. You just never know , it’s gambling . Some people time it right and think they’re master tradersIt’s not impossible. If you bought before today, cool. If you bought today, still possible, but ballsy.Can't recall ever seeing that high of IV, so never. I see 256% IV for 1/29 calls and it seems highly likely to print.By far my best call from when I first started this game. Dkng has printed heavy for me, I really wish rh had a screen to show how much you've lost or gained on an individual tickerICLN is fine but TAN is better imo. I'm split roughly 50/50 with leaps on both of them right now, but may move more into TAN soon. Biden's plan focuses bigly on solar, not wack ass hydrogen fuel cells that power forkliftsWouldn’t be surprised if Tesla is at 1000eomDude. I have failed so many times. It took me months and maxing my credit cards to finally make it one day and understand how this shit works. If you believe in yourself, double down. Don't be a pussy (unless of course you really suck at trading, then just work at Wendy's or something, idk)🚀🚀🚀🌕

Hope vito unbanned soon.

Its crazy mods hand out big bans for the  tiniest things sometimesYes you fucking retardThat could be anywhere from an accountant to an engineer to a nurse to a kindergarten teacher. Gonna have to be more specific.I am, I feel I got a decent position on this one to.Get the LotR crew out there asapshietmakes sense, they living in that upside down lifeYou’re not wrong about thatThey don't expire, they convertHold it 1 more day then if anythingPersonally I’m holding till Friday but if you want to lock in gains sell at open when we start out rocket to 50. I also like the idea of you exercising your calls 😂Exercise em like DFVAbsolutely would've sold today but tomorrow shouldn't be bad eitherDang dude a $535/contract (if you sell at the current bid) isnt anything to scoff at. We’ll likely see some more movement tomorrow as more short positions will be looking to close.


Take your profit when you feel comfortable, or  if you’ve got massive balls roll the sucker up and out and out to a later expiryThis isn’t **THE** squeeze just a small one, likely combined with insider buying, compounded by day traders resulting with what you sawThey’re not retarded but the thing with IV is, it’s basically like momentum. 


It could keep squeezing, but if it stays where it’s at for a few days, IV will go down (not too much imo given everything going on with the stock rn but still..) 

When IV goes down it will impact option price negatively. 

The options have a very high chance of losing money moving forward if GME is not able to maintain IV.

The stocks are more likely to get more gains since they can stall out for a few days and keep marching no problem.

Obvi tho stocks will have much lower return than call options.

It’s risk/reward, you decide what’s best for you!


TLDR: If I was you I would sell calls and wait for IV to drop and buy back in or wait for share price to drop to buy back in.Thats. My. Dog.75 shares checking in just cuz that was my buying power ah yeaterdayMeet me behind Wendy’smine too. i have a 850/860 spread so im obv nervous. def gonna dip tmr but i dont think u will be that fuckedoh you’re fine thenWill do commando 820 putsThere’s some real weird shit up thereI definitely do. I think there's going to be a little bit of Battle Royale with many of these companies because it's really saturated but as long as you stick to ETFs and maybe one or two stocks it's only the beginning.Idk mabye there's another catalyst, but if there's not I might sellNo asset performance. Do you really think plug can make enough h2 cars without an h2 mandate?

First Solar is sold out to 2023. They cannot increase manufacturing to match the earnings.i dont think it shows whether they covered or sold more, but i think overall there was a change in 33m short positions, so at most 33m covered. BUT could also mean 33m more shares were shorted. Honestly i think some covered and more shorted.Someone shorted at 86 and then rebought at the end of the day with continuous pressure. Flushing call holders. Bear raid.Just looked funny to me but what do I knowHaha first of many.  When her ETFs stop going up and start going down 5% a month she won't get fresh money.  When she stops getting fresh money she can't pump her positions.  When she can't pump her positions whole market is f'd.  It's coming soon.  Get ready.Go further out. I have 15c Jan 2022. Wait for a dip and jump in.I mean, I'll take it but realistically it'll be 25 end of year. 

I mean knowing us retards well probably pump it to 50 by April with the whole merger going on.I know bro, but its Elon. Never doubt the Muskbuy puts thenIf tsla stock went down based on car faults it would be at 0 by nowhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366What are calls ? New at this trading thing2020*The visa deal was acquiring it for $5.3 billion so I can’t see them valuing it at $20+ billion nowokayDollar is reserve currency and until that changes there will always be demand for it.

30% less makes American exports more competitive. 

Biden green energy deal will create a new revolution like the tech revolution a few decades back.No homie, that's mph or miles per hourAAPL is boomer stock. They’ve between $126 and $130 for so long I get a headache looking at their chart.ThanksDown is not always bad, it’s dip. Look at the chart.My leaps certainly hope soI hope I am wrong. I have 4 97.5s...Calls on the M4 thenEarnings call on 29th + a catalyst tomorrow. Be patient.Haha! Yeah, tomorrow probably red then. I wouldn’t be surprised if nothing happens till next week or eom.Lmao, I'll bite.
Tech sector may be going down tmr due to sleepy Joe's speech. Tech down, boomer up and then if you want you can get outta your positions. I'm holding some leaps for steel gang but yeah we'll see what happens.No X but have some steel. Scared with you gaizHave you checked out vito’s sub?There's a catalyst tomorrow, but short term it's hard to predict. The fundamentals haven't changed, so I am holding on to my position. But it's money I'm happy to lose if it doesn't work out. If it is a yolo I recommend against it.R/vitardsGot what wrong? Gene expression is highly statistically significant but not that effective when checked clinically, Indicating it is less likely the case that the single gene target editing cures the disease. I think their result justifies the drop as it affects future studies.👽Yeah it was like $0.87 at the beginning of today. $1.30 now. It could go up or just crash and die like a true penny stock but hey, i grabbed 500 shares for funsiesYes.If you figure out when earnings there's no way it can go tits upThere was no other catalyst? How about the Ryan Cohen news on Monday you fucking retard. And before you say “that was two days ago” look at the last jump GME had when RC upped his stake. It was a few days after he did. Cramer caused 144m volume today? No, no he didn’t.I am not smart enough to know if the short squeeze is over, and I wasn't implying that I think it is over. That's just why GME is up so much. There was no news or other catalyst today is what I meant.

I'm hoping today was just the retail puts and shorts trying to get out, and we still have a squeeze on institutional positions coming. Also saw someone say there's 200,000 call options currently open with a 1/15 expiration. Apparently Melvin Capital also holds 51,000 puts expiring Friday. If that is all accurate, then I don't see how the squeeze would stop.Both. Calls a month out and shares. The more capable of diamond handing through a drop you are the more your mixture should tend towards calls. Bought 16 contracts because I'm almost certain it will gap up tomorrow when even more short sellers rush to close their short positionWelp getting same calls as you tomorrowAgreedI only play stocks like a nerd. I need the sleep tbhRobinhoodOh shit why didn't you say so. Ur good. In fact double down. But for real. IDK. I am trying my best to play meme stocks on the rise not ones that already have gain porn. Food for thought. Cuz then again TSLA never stops and it has a library of gain porn. Pick your poison.When closing a short position, you need to “buy” the shares that you shorted. 

So if 50% of the float is shorted, and the price rapidly rises, the people who have shorted the stock need to take massive losses to close off their positions. This can result in margin calls which forces the most over leveraged shorts to buy, which raises the price and triggers more margin calls ect. It’s a spiral.There are definitely some zombie companies, and SPACS and IPOs are making little sense.  But the ETFs are buying plug and TSLA so it’s not a bubble in that respect.That’s basically what I said.  But the stock market won’t crash, the dollar will.  As for when I picked the timing- it depends what currency you are comparing too.Which is good, the higher percentage short the more of a break out it will have.  I’m deep in callsIf you’re on Twitter I recommend following @traderstewie

He’s been posting charts in DKNG a lot this week and is very bullish on it.  He’s been hitting a ton of his calls and it’s been benefiting me greatly!thats weird dude.  Does the total value add up though?Cars is what got them to where they are. Lucid should be 100 EOY atleastMmm speak dirty to me ... So my 1/15 are safe ?stop don't say that. Not when I bought the fucking dip

also, buyden is speaking tomorrow so 🤞the world would make sense

Amazon and Walmart gotta be absolutely jizzing themselves though as they execute their warrants lmao40c 1/15 will make money... just not nearly as much as it would have with lower IVOh yeah. I'm going balls deep in ARKX in my real accountCheck out the weedsubreddits. I’ll try to find a link to why I think APHA will beat expectations... one sec

bullish short term options positioning has been holding the market upI’m in 1/29 860s. Wish I had bought them tomorrow instead of today.Earnings Coming up 😎🚀I only have 200 shares. But I sold calls on them and now I’m regretting it. So I dunno. Which I had more free cash to buy more. But the rest is in apple calls feb expiryI worry about pullbacks on a lot of these clean energy stocks once people realize some of them will never be profitable.  Best case scenario for FCEL for example is to be bought out by apple.Chances are really low an option will get executed if it’s not really close to expiry date even if it’s ITM at the momentOofThe fact Apple went with Hyundai is just a true sign to get out of Apple imo. They've lost all innovation and their attempt to jump into the EV game is joining with....Hyundai?  And years later than so many other competitors that will already have EVs on the road?  I doubt AAPL will tank but it's never going to experience that true EV bump we are getting right now with other EV stocksYeah, it's been a rather odd week for steel. Someone I was talking to said it was trading at a slightly lower price. The LME had rebar trading at 660 per tonne on the 8th and it has gone down since then and settled at like 634ish range. Similarly scrap is also down since the 8th. I'm not sure if that alone has caused this drop or if it is MM making moves.Gonna open flatI’m just using Tesla killer as an example of how this company can steal market share. Tesla will still dominate the market and maintain their dominance if they play their cards right. 

But, if you were to ask any experts on which companies have the potential to compete with Tesla, you would find a consensus agreement on Lucid and Rivian being at the top of that list.I think he means the c. cap rumors are just that right now, rumors. It’s not public yetI got in at 13.28 on Monday, sold on Tuesday with cold feet, back in at 15.37 today... can’t make up my mindThanks, just saw. Will move money from HZONIt’s old news. They already started repairs since NovemberI have calls aswell, we megafuk maybeYou son of a bitch I'm inCalls buddyThere's an app bro.The more pressure we’ve got on the short position the higher it goes. Grab calls if you want but there might not be much for sale when we open.Sell 30c FD on every spike, it’s free moneyThen whoever they buy them from will cover...Oh yeah I've seen this recently I think. Don't know exactly, like some said, collateral requirement changed under the hood is my guess. Or perhaps raising cash via exiting options "loosens" your marginThanks man, ggs. You played really wellIt’s a long term buy and hold so if you must, buy physical gold or silver.

But if you want something long term I would go w/ bcoin and get in when it dips to high 20’s low 30’sIf Apha tanks, Tilray is deadNo. It’s Thursday morningWtf there are penny💩stocks and then there is this bulllllll lol good luck though!hope tomorrow or inauguration speech does it. otherwise im fukfor being under a certain market cap

I wouldn't hold on much longer my guySell at market or set a limit on it for the desired gains. I would watch this if you can and see where it goes. Lets not forget there’s a man here holding millions of dollars of calls with zero intentions of closing them. 💎🤲I bought SPCE at these levels like a month ago. You’re not too late.Yep, afraid so.

I kinda see hangouts, e-sports, and e-sports betting as an avenue they could go for growth, like capitalizing on the potential for the social aspect of gaming. Though I dunno how easy it is for them to expand beyond retail.Have faith in the one true god GME ..Der ganze Scheißhaufen ist total überbewertetLegit, ark has over 10% of some of its holdingsExcept squeeze hasnt really started yet looCheck out DASH similar situationWrong. I'm a millennial gamer and I will never not buy physical copies of games.Idk i was just fuckin aroundHow do you know people stopped viewing it?I don’t have the facts facts but from what I’ve read, most people who invested are holding on till Friday.Dude GME is a done. Try something else that has more potential. And If your going to use robinhood then learn how it works first and dont risk a lot of money on your first couple tradesI don’t know man, I would wait to see how high it wakes up toI'm doing it. Fuck it.Gonna need a recount on this.Y?Ay inefficient tax gang 😤Thank you!I just put 2 limit buys, one for $29 and $30 on RH. Is it best for me to just do their market buy right now and go all in instead of hoping they fill?So would a 40c for 1/15 be insane?Ah, good to know! ThanksIs that just the way it works. Calls and outs expire in Friday’s?Robotaxi network, mobile app integration, tsla cars connect to the internet.

Are you retarded? TSLA has 0 to do with space. TSLA has plenty that are connected to the internet technology.Oh man, it varies. Over the course of this last year my most profitable trades from the top of my head have been plug, dkng, czr, pltr, nio and all the similar ev startups, aapl, rkt, spacs, etc. And other more stable things, but the idea is where it's okay to play some of these meme stocks, you need enough money that it's not taking up a huge amount of your portfolio. Which is why it just doesn't work with small accounts, eventually you gonna be bagholding shit that popped and you don't want that on your whole portfolio. But I'm more than happy to only get a couple hundred a week on meme stocks, the shit adds up heavy, in part there's luck here but I've gotten alright at reading the momentum of a stock and when to not touch or when to exit a position. Sprinkle some call buys, usually couple months out, especially on shit you're wheeling that you want some of that upside on while you sell calls that will be assigned if it moons, in there for fun gambling money and life is goodSay you got assigned on an 18p gme sell you sold for $100, you turn around and sell a 20c for this week for $100 or whatever I'm just making up numbers, it obviously moons to the 30s, you made $400 off of $1800 in 2 weeks. Obviously less than ideal in this situation but it's still a winIf you want to become a BFT holder im hearing theyll get them for sureOur time?!!! I’ve been waiting for my time since mango man took office!! LMAO!It is though this stuff has been happening for decadesWell if the guy on the internet was rational and had reason to expect the stock to go up soon  it's a much better investment chance than the 3% id make that month on the dow or nasdaqOh I hear you. It's up to us that don't need that whatever stimulus to help out our friends neighbors that need it more. We need to be good stewardsHmm. Interesting take. Definitely didn’t consider the euro perspective. Seems like you know a lot about this tech and are making good plays off it, which is why I don’t really touch tech anymore, hah.A potential legislative catalyst though. Almost everything tanks after earnings lately, so I bought before right ER in case they have something amazing that’ll break that trend, but bought far enough out where the buzz around the dem senate voting on the MORE act should take effect and pump the whole sector. This was a risky play, but I certainly put a lot of thought into and considered their post ER performance in the past. I’m also only in a few contracts tbh and don’t really care if I lose it all.

Tbh though I did expect it to be down today going into ER so that was a 🤡 play and I should’ve bought yesterday.Calls on your ways 😤My friend did this in Thailand. Granted he's into trannies, but hes living the life of a king. They apparantly love white foreigners there.And lose even more?!!! Just like the Tesla shirt sellers?!!Bro $200 can’t do muchTy for the ideaBut... but wsb controls the market?🤨Eng. Mtrx. 

IV shouldnt scare you out of a play bro. What makes you think it wont go higher than 150%?U seem IV om somr shot grts to like 5k% or moreI had gains from icln. It is a great etf. But when you dig deeper into the clean energy sector, i think it is not hard to find 'undervalued' tickers. Because wallstreet dont know how to price this shit yet. You cam find tickers with huge volume and low stonk price. I believe this is the precursor to big moves in underlying. Look at average volume ans then daily volume. If you nltice one has high volume compared to its average, along with big % gains it is probably gettimg bougjt institutionally. As eng and mtrx are rn. If it is a bubble, those shits go everywhereYea there’s some pretty dumb people here, I guess it’s hard to tell what’s satire and what’s serious now lmao. Thanks for lookin out ✊🏼What caused the rise is stock accumulation, not the short squeeze, which means the short squeeze is yet to startYou must be new here to the moon 🚀🚀🚀I blinked and it dropped from 92% to 59% but doesn't matter because we're hitting 100Good point lol.  Most likely just gonna be watching like squidward from the sidelines.All shares.  Guess just bagholding for the foreseeable future.  Will try and get my PLTR moved before the lockup ends though.

It’s a farce.Yeah offshore oil platforms in the north atlantic...he said he would rather be homeless.ok boomerWhat I don’t get is - is it solely due to the shorts or is there actually perceived value in the company? (Does it even make a difference for stock purposes?)Thanks I’ll go with sharesyeah but to maintain that IV we'd basically need an even bigger day. which is beyond ballsy imo. when is the last time you saw 400% IV lol.right but I said I was talking about FDs

Palms are getting sweatyThank you very muchI'm still learning and can't fully answer, but you basically buy an option to get the stock at a later date for a certain price, but you have to hope it gets to that price or you lose. It comes in bundles of 100 shares. It can make you more money and is more risky. I wish I knew what I was doing, because this one feels like a good play, but I'm sticking to share buying/selling until I learn more.OPTIONS when you bet on stock going UP, PUTS when u bet on stock going downThat's what I'm saying. The Visa Deal was agreed on a while ago, we don't know the growth of the company since. We do know that they've expanded rapidly. As a market, fintechs have been increasing in value like crazy. Admittedly, I'm mostly talking out of my ass. We'll just have to wait and seeAckman wanted a minority stake in a company.. if the Plaid deal was $5.3 billion and PSTH has $4-$7billion he’d have the entire company.Spot on. The problem is that artificially inflating your currency will negate any potential for your exports to become more competitive.

Your federal reserve is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any move in either direction will fuck shit up - this is why they've resorted to just continuing to print.

I'm genuinely curious to see how this all pans out.Shit. My bad! 

Miles per hour of gas!There are very strong rumors they going public via spac and will be making luxury EVs.O i mean just as a general rule. Sometimes I like to look at futures and go great I lose money on open today. I do know that dips are natural and healthy for a stock. It's not money until you sell it right lol.

There are even times when the futures are bright green red and certain stocks don't even move. Those are my wtf days where i stare at the screen staring at the stock and yelling WTF MAN GO UP.I’ve been playing AMD since it first hit $17. It can trade sideways for months and months and then all of a sudden it just takes off.How much did you pay? Expiration?As the CEO indicated, the placebo groups got messed up in a 1 in 250 chance, due to older patients.  So the results weren't statistically significant for the whole study, however  "*-- In the pre-specified analysis by age-group, by which the randomization was stratified, participants aged 4-5 years at time of treatment with SRP-9001 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in NSAA total score versus the age-matched placebo cohort, achieving a 4.3-point improvement on NSAA at 48 weeks post-treatment from baseline --"*  from here: [https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-announces-top-line-results-part-1-study-102](https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-announces-top-line-results-part-1-study-102)The analysts just saw "statistically insignificant" and called it off.  They didn't dive into the details nor hear the explanation from the CEO (read the Barron's article). Maybe I'm missing something?It took 1 day. And it bumped it up to 21-22 which it alrdy did. And Cramer mentioning the new board members gave an extra boost. Which brought in more day traders, scalpers, FOMO folks, etc all adding up to the insane volumeI'd put them far out (not weeklies). It might take some time for this mishap to be seen.Let's get those tendies! Spread the word, the institutions want to get it back in at a low price. Good luckI just started with this meme stock shit, I’m in on ICLN and that seems like a safe, but slow burn. This sub has been screaming about PLTR for a while and after what happened with GME I figured fuck it. Hopefully in the future I’ll be able to find meme stocks on the rise, but for now hopefully the bandwagon takes me to the moon 🚀🚀🚀I honestly think what is fueling this might be option writers hedging their positions, you can match up option volume to teslas stock price going up and works exactly with plug and nio and all of the hype stocks[deleted]I am on twitter and I do follow him. Hopefully he's right on DKNG.No that’s the whole problem the total value is not adding up at allNo tech and energy is what got them to where they the cares a great sure but the they are a tech companyWhen is he speaking? I hope we print together broI mean don’t get me wrong I had calls for the run up. We’ll see if tomorrow ends up being different 🤷🏻‍♂️Why so?What’s that mean I’m not sure what that mean exactly. I know usually after earnings shit either drops or remains consistentTim 🍎's wet fart on a Tuesday morning has more actual revenue than TSLA and all those EVs combined.Ok lol I don’t own any but that’s not true 😂this.Exactly, idk why they released it today. They prob wanted it to dip. First it was the 1st responder battery issue and now this. They are begging for a dipGod guess we’ll see:/I feel like we would have dipped more tho tbhU don’t think there’s gonna be a big run up for demo day?YepExcellent. I have calls on APHA and TLRY. Hopefully they print (more) tomorrowGlad i bought ITM for once. I learned my lesson from OTM PLTR calls. Godspeed good sir!Shares can’t hurt me!I don’t think I willWhat if it goes past 40 tomorrow? Will that be enough to overcome the theta?That man also has contracts expiring on Friday! Did he not sell??????Wait you’re actually recommending selling puts on a short squeezed stock, I thought you were joking LMAO. I’d rather just buy some calls instead of risking $100 for $2500 collat. Theta gang is really not the strat rn anyways.lol gme was at $20 yesterday what do you mean it has no chance of getting assignedWhat an astute observationYou’re his personal google nowI ain’t mad lil homie. Just was confused. 

I just make people tendies for free, I’m a hard guy to hate.Reeeeeeeeeeee-call.God speed bro hopefully ur plays hitBoth those are using old data, you absolute troglodite. They both use the bi-weekly short data. As you can see they both list the 68,130,000 from 12/31, with Short Interest appearing to use the most recent data released early, which is still days out of date.

ShortIntrest.com says it's 20 minutes delayed because it still updates volume and days to cover based on volume. It's not 20 minute delayed short volume you moron.Unfortunately, you’re very wrong. You would have been right not too long ago, but the story has changed. I’m not here to convince you otherwise; I think you’ll just have to see for yourself where GME goes in 2021 and beyond.Well, I am 36. My kids are 13 and 17. I partied and did drugs during my teens/early 20s and never went to college. I am an incredibly hard worker and I have exceled in every position I have ever held. Unfortunately I have some pretty severe anxiety that has cost me countless jobs. I've done fuck all for my family and children financially. I have nothing to give them or help them in life. They are amazing kids that have literally never been in trouble, they treat everyone else with kindness and have always been grateful for what we do have. They are intelligent and do well in school. Every time we get our tax refund we just catch up on bills, buy clothes, repair the car, etc. Never saved money. So this is my attempt to maybe finally give them something. If I lose it all, it's not much different than every other year. Thank you for the advice though.I thought we agreed on at least another 2 years of bull market!Sure thing man. Here to learn (if you can call it that) so had to jump on something I actually do know 😎Bruder alles ist überbewertet aber das hab ich mir auch schon nach der v recovery im März gedachtIt was shooting up like a rocket for the first half hour, then it stopped completely. The way that post thing was compiled made it impossible to view the posts in it and no one would see my completely unrelated post in all that GME garbage because they’re all the same post and they’d stop scrolling after 6 or 7

I want to clarify, I don’t care about shitty Reddit karma, I care about exposure for charitiesIf he’s already found this page it’s a little late for himCash settled cuz you can day trade all u want just takes a day to settle your tradesRobinhood is lame and you need to have a 25K portfolio before they let you daytrade like a big boiWhy whatEuropoor here, don't think I need to pay taxes on this shitAsked the question I have been looking up and down the subreddit for! I also thank both of you.https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/options/

You can see all dates in the drop down menu.We will see bud if I’m wrong I’m wrong but I can see her adding a broad description like “enabling technology” to pump the etf up. Regardless of how it goes I’m prob gonna jump in itThans dude. Theta gang looks like a good deal, consistent money every week.Yeah that’s not a win man. I understand what you’re saying, but I’m sure you realize the unrealized loss you take on selling those calls right? Just had to comment because if you were theta gang on GME this week, yeah you made some money as theta gang does, but the potential gains you lost could be massive.3% per month!!!! Lololol! How out of touch are you!? Have you never invested your entire life before March!? I try to make 1.25% per month! Got damnI need my stimulus to help pay off my college. I'm a nontraditional going back after years of not being in college with a family to feed. I wish poor people ran our government. I'm in retail management and I've worked at stores in nice areas and stores in ghettos. Whenever we'd raise money for food banks it never failed that the rich area stores raised the least money. One common theme that I always heard from the poorer areas was, yes I'll donate, I've had to use the food bank before. I just find it amazing how quickly people forget what life was like when they were broke as fuck and in college.Fed 12 300C FB is going for 1.75

Last time FB was in this range it shot up to 302 

That 1.75 would go up 10 foldWSB does control meme stonks. Tutes control the other 90%.hmm yeah if u dive deep then perhaps u can find a great stock and not like fomo plug lol. if u do ur dd and u find that great stock i'd say make a big bet for the long term! i'm gonna hold to ICLN until June and see what ima cash out. I'm hoping it goes up 12 dollars at least by thenThat was a short squeeze.I was in at 17.GotchaEs todo pinche gringo suerte mañana viva mexico culerosAye at least you’re trying that’s enoughNo overtime pay, but you now have a manager discount which is 75% off one purchase each shift instead of 50%. That’s money back in your pocket!Okay you’re cracked my guyWhat car do you useI haven't expensed fucking anything in 10 months and the only airline/hotel status I have is shit that was extended.

KILLING MEOk, it makes more sense now. Godspeed to you are your friends.RemindMe! 2 Months “did lil Nicky lost his 100$”Yeah there’s no such thing as a Reddit ban for using the f****t word. This is definitely my only account and I’ve only been on wsb for 2 months. You are a brainless slug aren’t youoh fuck lmaoI split to X lol which promptly droppedyes but that means we don't have RH autists to pump200k yr?There is actual value up to 50ish for the current console cycle, Ryan Cohen is trying to (and succeeding at) revamping the company for the 21st century, and the shorts have artificially and recklessly driven this stock into the ground. Triple digits definitely possible during the actual squeeze.Uh the latter but both. I dropped 400 shares in at 17 and 4 grand in options, the options printed hard and I got a lot more in smaller amounts since. I have 600 shares of dkng currentlyDon’t be nervous. You got this man it’s just numbers lol not really but follow your gutGreed used to kill me. Then I learned to exit fast. I prefer to pursue 3 or 4 small winners with higher probability than try landing the big 10 bagger that will bankrupt you 9/10 times you know. Most of the time I miss out on profits, but timing the top of an option play is like, 10 times for difficult than timing the top of a stock.Really big deal. Doesnt matter if you're a smoke factory, no one wants some girl/guy finger banging themselves online looking after their kid at the stollery or school.It’s having a good time after market, I’m in for shares. I don’t fuck with options, I know the upside but I’m a pussy.Oh, just sell tomorrow then or see if DFV does his magic on Friday then sellAt the very least sell 7 and what the others rideYep. Idk what broker you use, but I’m on RH and afaik that’s the only way is to close out one and open anotherNono, there very well could be more short positions that are closed tomorrow and Friday resulting in more price movement. There was some DD I had read this morning  (I’ll edit this comment when I find it again), that mentioned that there was a substantial open interest on 1/15 $24 GME puts. There was little more than 28k in volume today on those puts against 51k open contracts


*Edit: here’s the DD I read this [morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) right before everything took off. It might not have been the one that references the 24p open interest, but still a good one to  comb through nonetheless. It’s a long post, but there are some pictures 😄😝I’m over here in the dumpsterDid u not see the price movement today hahaYea prollyI'm honestly hoping for a breather tomorrow. don't need this shit taking off so fast it stalls.Yeah I watched the volume all dayThey did this at $90 as wellI'm a wuss and am too scared to buy shorter terms in it. Or split the difference. Get half of your June ones and half 2022 ones.all we need is Joey B to mention EV's in his stimmy plan tomorrow and we're goldenYe I seen a lot of people make money off it what do they mean when they say this 1/15 ?Oh ok I seen some dude saying the gme will blowup in the next few weeks should I buy like 10 shares and hold for future ?Good pointYes, now you understandYeah I’ve noticed that2/19. I got them in December when the stock wasn't doing much. And I didn't sell when it nearly hit 100 the other day. 😑Isn’t the baseline score the pre-treatment score? Overall their experimental and control groups did not show much significance. That’s what they are stating there. And messing up something implies their inability to properly design experiments. In Short-term the price might go up but in the long run I think there’s a high risk.So in summary, 

protein expression = highly stat significant

experimental vs control = not significant

control (baseline) vs control (48-wk) = significant

Experimental (baseline) vs experimental (48-wk) = significant 

But this does not necessarily mean the treatment was significant per se. I think they might need more subjects.Lol alright man, it was definitely one CNBC talking head that cause this you’re a fucking geniusFebruary?Um never mind the stuff I just recommend is now banned. Well. Good luckFor those specific stocks you are very likely correct.You and I are talking the same language. But maybe I’m not eloquent enough. I’m trying to say exactly what you’re trying to say.He’s been on fire this weekok yeah i'd reach out to rhAlright u got it, lucid top quality version of NIO then is that better and new partnership with Amzn to bring Alexa to the car for the icing on top, so since it’s American I think 100 eoy not China manipulated and they are making their factory in Saudi$$$ ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  $$$A recall was announced AH.And?It will and that’s why you need to sell way OTM calls so they theta fuckedsigh, you too sirIt'll have to go way past 40 to be what it was worth today at 38. Time is running out and that shit is rapidly becoming worthless. Definitely don't be caught bagholding on Friday, make sure you sell before Friday.https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kie1dk/gme_yolo_update_dec_22_2020/ggqe63a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3oooook...but can we time the market ... printer macht BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR langfristig gewinnt immer inflation und damit hochThat's a good thing, I'm not faulting you for that.

I don't think me putting you on the list delists your post from the sub tho. I still see it not-collected. I can click on it and it says it's already in a collection, so obviously it renders outside of the collection.

If you find differently I'd like to know about it. This collection thing is new-ish to me. We've only used it once before.Can overnight trade with only 2k in a non cashh account. Buy at close, sell at open.  And you still have 3 day trades per week in case of a gme ripper like todayPretty sure that's the rule for all brokerages, but if you have a margin account with only 2k you can open at close and sell at open the next day. There's no day trading limits on overnight tradingEU doesn’t have cap gains tax??That's fairIt's great. Main risks are selling a stock for a lower price after it moons and buying a stock for a higher price when it tanks. Which is why the large portfolio is necessary. I won't sell a put on something I can't afford to sell another put on to average down if it tanks (ie amzn, I ain't that rich). Rkt netted me a shit ton on 200%iv in September, but it tanked hard asf. It's ended up a win in the end still by averaging down and milking small consistent profits in call sells. I wouldn't have been able to do that if I didn't have 25k to blow on averaging down. But realizing weekly and monthly profits from premium has been greatI wasn't playing gme, but that is a win. $400 on 1800 of collateral in 2 weeks? That's over a 20% return in 2 weeks, that's amazing. In any strategy there is hindsight is 20/20,i haven't cried about any position that got called away from me after it mooned.

Theta gang is about more frequent 1 to 2% days, not ten baggers.Sounds like you have a very bad strategy my friend. Well if you're happy with it I guess that's what's importantYeah unfortunately I can’t buy FAANGS because of work lmao it’s kinda sadWill you eat your dick if gme moons tommorow?Ayyyy yo fui al acapulco tambien!!! Tacos y cervesaaaaAcapulco me encanteMucho suerte a ti tambien amigo. Check out eng and mtrx in the clean energy sector. Couple months out. And SOS is a sleeping fintech giant. It is chinese so buyer bewareOctane ofchahahah You must be in sales too.

I've been rotating all my spending onto my southwest visa.  Keepin that A list no matter what lolMake your money early.  Don't end up a boring middle aged desk jockey like the rest of us!  Live man!  Live![deleted]I’m banking on their earnings 🤡You’re right... I definitely forgot about that... welp at this point I’m banking on earnings 🤡Not in this oil market.Makes sense, thanks. Do you agree with others that IV is too high for options now and shares are the move?Gotcha. Thank you boss! Hope you make money :)I agree. I was up very comfortably but got greedy and theta ate me. But I think I will form a strategy around this and act on it. Thanks for the insight, hope you make money!So they would throw it out?this actually sounds like the move.I did, but that's decently OTM for retard strengthIght well I have 1/15 calls so chill with that talk lolLmao I mean pros and cons to TLRY. Looks like they are a weed stock. All time chart isn’t pretty. Maybe a weed lagger?When is this supposed to happen for real? I've been looking trying to find some sort of announcement about it and haven't found anything. Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough

Edit: I know it's tomorrow just wondering around what time and everythingThe gamble expires on that date. So if the stock doesn't reach the price by then they lit their money on fire.Dude stock is already up like %100+ in a week... my rule is... don’t buy stock if it’s up 80% in a day....too riskyIf (when) it runs going into earnings you can flip your calls to a spread so you don’t get completely fucked by IV crush after ER.I don't think so, I think if you look at the age groups,  4-5 did better. Designing the experiment sounds easy, but we are talking about rare diseases and unknown factors and dumb luck. Here is an explanation from the CEO: [https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/events/event-details/sarepta-therapeutics-39th-annual-jpmorgan-healthcare-conference-presentation](https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/events/event-details/sarepta-therapeutics-39th-annual-jpmorgan-healthcare-conference-presentation). Right at the beginning.  I could be wrong about this, but who knows. Scroll to 7 minutes, he explains.No I don't think it's that way, but agree they need more subjects. See the other post or scroll to 7 minutes in this presentation: [https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/events/event-details/sarepta-therapeutics-39th-annual-jpmorgan-healthcare-conference-presentation](https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/events/event-details/sarepta-therapeutics-39th-annual-jpmorgan-healthcare-conference-presentation)

in 4-5 year olds, treatment was statistically significant.  

in 6-7 year olds, it was not due to difficulty establishing baseline.   Curious your thoughts, maybe the CEO is full of bullshit?And the risk is when there is nothing fueling the fomo then people aren't buying as many options the stock will bleed and could crash, huh just gotta wait until there are no more catalysts left and then start to shortHe said he had a 65 to 70PT for DKNG, but didn't give us a TL for it.Idk man tough call. Personally I would say Canoo $GOEV gets to 100 before lucid does. That’s just my thoughts though.I have retrieved these for you _ _

Fuck tho I’m tryna get my money up and not my funny up; cause this one call of Tesla is mad expensive since I’m doing cash covered putsHow far out r u selling CCs?But maybe he’s just posturing in that comment 🤔Regardless, it’s not from anything related to GME and I feel like what you did is hurting exposure for charities so please take it outYeah but youre not understamding. I am on a cash settled account. So i can make as many trades per day as i want. The trade is settled by the next day. I like this type of account. But i judt went over 25k today so i might look into a margin account now. But TDA rates are junkYeah but once a year over the total amount of cash you hold in savings+investment accounts. So if I sell and then buy and repeat that 10 times, it has no tax consequencesPoint taken, can’t argue about profits. When you’re doing you’re theta gang, how many plays are you doing at a time on average? Thanks for the continued conversation btwWell my very bad strategy has afforded me financial freedom over many years. Cheers.LolImma look into it my g, right now I’m balls deep in GME but I’m gonna need somewhere to put the gains so thanks 🇲🇽📈I bought a TW octane for 80 bucks 2 weeks ago and now it’s worth 130....I'm debating dropping everything to focus on getting Premier 1K back this year. Once I'm vaccinated I'll be traveling a shit ton for personal downtime. No idea yet when the hell work will green light biz travel again..Cool bro have fun being a 12 year old girlWouldn't touch FDs. Planning on buying more shares and 1/22 calls tomorrow morning. If it triples from current price then I could care less about IV.Same to you! Good luck 🍀yeah, when you feel like your up good and are complacent, that's the time to exit, simple. Otherwise, MMs will eat you alive bro, they know retards are greedy. Good luck broIf you disclosed on the resume that you had an OF then ya lolYup it's a good one. Lock in your profits but still got some going so you don't fomoRetard strength is gone broLmao hey man, refuel tomorrow for the Pluto rocket to $420 on Friday.Merging with APHA...should do well in the weed space.715pmSomeone said like 7:30p est or some shit like that so its way after market closeOh ok so my understanding is u call for a price and date that a specific stock will go too then u get paid basaiclly ?That's the hope. I should have done that yesterday. I hope your target is right though!So I don’t know much about this disease specifically but in developmental or neural developmental studies it is normal to account for the age when you use treatments. The impression I had from their initila approach is they failed to properly design their experiments because they did not account for the age which is typically a norm in the field. Yes 4-5 years old does improve functional scores overall compare to 6-7. Results seem fine as long as their analyses are all accurately done (which can only be found when they publish their results on peer reviewed papers). Some concerns I have are that they primarily measured functional scores but no others, potential side effects in the long term. Also if this is age dependent, let’s say it works only at early age before 5, it significantly reduces the market size for the product.. I think this may be the biggest problem with their results. But yea it looks like it is working okayish for early groups (although no long term clinical scores are collected) as long as the CEO is not bullshitting some parts in their slides. And just a reminder that only peer reviewed papers are trustworthy in general..Godspeed 🌈🐻 GodspeedHard to put an exact timeline on these things.  You in shares or calls?Based on a rumor of apple that’s not confirmed?Lucid actually has cars on the street you know right?Not long. Just 2 weeks out. Yeah they are pricey, Tesla is a volatile stock.He’s got even more calls for April. I don’t think he’s selling anything anytime soon.I'm saying regardless of everything, and especially with you probably dropping below 25k in the future, you should open up a separate robinhood margin account.  Only need 2k to fund it and then can open trades at close and close at open next dayEU becoming more appealing by the dayAt least 10,most expire worthless I can average down where I need toI made 13k om gme today and sold so i can reposition with shorter dated calls. Shit is flying. Those other plays are the 'diversification'   but fr sos is gomma be big and eng also. Calls are cheap few mpmths away. GME 🚀🚀🚀🌋🌋🌋🚀🚀🚀  What stike u playing dudeI think I lost my Hilton diamond status.  I've been too afraid to call and ask lmao[deleted]Thanks!Wouldn’t the employer do a scan and find you have an only fans.forreal. maybe ill do my part and buy shares with the profits tooJust what I wanted to hear. Thank you. How low we dipping??Fuck well hopefully there's anticipation buys beforehand and hope that we ride a rocket on FridayMe too. I’m like 70% that it hits 105 after ER. Overall market conditions are the big risk here.Yes, and he spoke to the point, not accounting for proper baselines in the 6-7 group.  And yes they need to publish the results of the work to a peer reviewed paper, agreed.   I think the stock is oversold, but you make great points.  This treatment is noted for its lack of side effects (Pfizer's version has lots of side effects).  I'm excited for the peer reviewed paper as well, and that's what matters. But this is a very prestigious company that is already selling products to help in this space. Good points, thanks.2500 shares at 54. Sold my 40k calls and just went all shares.Based on that they are a tech/car manufacturer. I see a lot of commercial use potential. Lucid is like the Ford of ev imo. Yes the cars are very luxurious and beautiful. But nothing more then just cars. Most people won’t need cars if robotaxis take over.Yea how many of them do you see every day?Why does the break even have to be higher than my strike price / target price?Oh yeah i should. I have a rh account that is down 100% 20k right now. I will greatly enjoy bringing that back to lifeLower salaries but no domestic terrorism. It kinda evens outI sold at nearly the top today and got in in the dip again in 39c 1/15 lmfao let’s hope the squeeze keeps on going tomorrowIf you had it going into 2020, it should still be good.

Worst case, you can just get the Hilton Aspire CC - comes with Diamond status.You really that upset about me saying market cap for the value of assets in an ETF? Go outside bro find a hobby or some shitDid you use your real name???Beats me. 12ish...and that is based on nothing but a guess. I sold half of my 2022 at 150% gain and will let the other half ride.Yea but becareful with the stock since there is likely an investigation by a law firm (Portnoy Law Firm from the news). SP might not move too much in short term. I would hold shares over calls since such investigation can hinder SP recovery. They also have other pipelines so it might be worth a shot.  good luck!Shit you’re good, well hit 60 soon.Yes but people buy stocks who are selling products, there’s a reason NNDM is at 11, they aren’t selling their products but it’s a brilliant idea. When GoEv has a factory and a loyal customer and is pumping out numbers then yeah, before then no, it’s gonna stay low until they have those. Even if it gets momentum they’re gonna do an offering every pop because they have no moneySame amount as NIO
