Not 100% but there was a tweet recently that showed positive towards it
GME tendie printer back on 🚀🚀🚀
Then you are fine, and I would hold for at least 366 days this way when you sell you won’t have to pay short term capital gains tax. Also it’s hard to know when to sell and buy back into, if you sell to capture profit and the stock skyrockets, you may never get the chance to buy in where you sold at, and you would have been better just holding long term
Could kill two birds with one stone, too. If you educate about finances and include the impact a child out of wedlock can do to your finances, teens might start to rubber up off of those numbers alone. I had more knowledge of sex than money and had a child at 20 with my ex girlfriend. Now I’m getting raked over the coals for CS and it’s impacted my ability to save in my IRA and 401k and I’m also stuck in a job I don’t love just to be able to stay current with support.
works until it doesn't 🤯
How many Tim hortons locations had been closed ?

gme gonna open 43.69
Definitely lost tendies lmao
I'm considering buying some more
Urg, tnxp 🚀🚀🚀
If you can risk it, try CFDs too, 6x leverage on xm or 5x on etoro, option premiums are through the roof

Every 2x price of underlying, 6x premium in and out, nobody is talking about it

3 2xs exit equivalent to 216x xxx and dream on 

But safe to play 6x pure 30 cost basis sleep mode too
So I just checked the Wiki article about Bloomberg terminals, and at a lease cost of $20k/yr for their 350k users, they're pulling in $6,500,000,000/yr in licensing fees alone 🤯
He just wants them to hit $1800
Can you expand on why?
The unnamed to $19 already
Still, my calls expire worthless soon
!remindme 75 days

Shares of deep itm are probably the play

Can nikola pump like gme

> explanation as to whom/what (and to what extent) is influencing the prices at the Forex market.

Use "who" not "whom". Whom is an object. Who can be either an object or subject. In your sentence,however, you're incorrectly using whom as a subject. You'd say "*who* is influencing the prices?" not "*whom* is influencing the prices?"

You're welcome.
Its up +0.30%
Avoid. Its going to tank. I was a airbnb host for years. Guests will want to stay in hotel chains with good cleaning practices and better control. Airbnb has no moat and is likely to be hit by changing consumer tastes. Remember couch surfing and hostelworld, yeah were great once but now worth a fraction of what they were.
All the rich GME bois, including moi will wanna smartly diversify after this 50% BB, 50% PLTR
you mean i should buy deep ITM calls?
Volunteered at an animal rescue for many, many hours and id call it stress free and fun. The girls there thought it got pretty stressful at times but its all perception. Sure you get injured dogs and quite a bit of gross stuff but the animals are always happy to see you and the customers are often about as happy as they will ever be when they walk through the place. Yeah you lose animals but you help a fuck ton more than you lose so an overwhelmingly positive thing, and death is natural. 

Its all individual, I knew a brain surgeon (quite literally) who was perfectly happy and content being a janitor. He was an immigrant, got to work with his family and friends and the odd time get his brain racked by doctors for his opinion on something. He was a janitor at a hospital, and oddly enough his area was the OR. 

I could probably be a bungee jump tower operator as well, that sounds like fun. 

Long haul trucking part time would interest me, albeit only part time but we are talking about jobs post retirement. 

Some sort of parks and rec job, plenty of unskilled jobs there. 

Barista at a busy ass starbucks probably isn't a ton of fun, but a small town local coffee shop that is just loved by the locals? Its not my cup of tea but I could see it being great for many people.
Best gme call to buy at open?
GME was trading around 4$ a year ago when he invested. Lots of people were expecting for it to go bankrupt. Calls are cheap when the strike price seems improbable. For GME to reach where it is now was a perfect storm of events.
He is retarded. Forgive him.
Should I buy more gme at open?

/u/LikesTheTunaHere, I have found some errors in your comment:

 > “times but ~~its~~ [**it's**] all perception”

 > “~~Its~~ [**It's**] all individual”

You, LikesTheTunaHere, have posted a solecism and should write “times but ~~its~~ [**it's**] all perception” and “~~Its~~ [**It's**] all individual” instead. ‘Its’ is possessive; ‘it's’ means ‘it is’ or ‘it has’.

How do we know that gme has Not squeezed yet? I don’t believe it will be an exact copy of vw. Regret not opening a position yesterday at open, and I know I shouldn’t do it today but fuck is it tempting

Do they sell pillows? Because now he makes pillows.

1/15, don't want to gamble here
That shit keeps going up at 35 now lollll
Do option premiums change price after hours on TD? (like the stock prices)
It does, but it also puts more coins in your pocket and at the end of the day, that's all that matters. Don't let prettiness get in the way of profits.
Let’s all pump it for no reason eh?
 [https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME](https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME)
Yeah the catch is they kinda expensive though but bigger returns , I like doing longer dated calls like 2to 4 months out

Yoloed in 5k on margin. First time autist here
This paint is beige lol, it's not doing anything. If this shit hits 35 eow I'll shit on my floor.
I'm by no means an expert but I'll give my two cents in an attempt to help.

Keep in mind that USD is the worlds reserve currency and so it's also seen as a 'safe haven'. So in times of global growth, USD performs well. In times of recession, USD performs well. In times of 'averageness' where we're kind of in the middle between recession and growth is when the USD historically dips. It's called the dollar smile theory.

The performance of AUD is largely tied to commodities because over 20% of their GDP is tied to commodities. So for fundamental analysis it's a good idea to keep an eye on the price of Iron Ore, Petrolium and Gold and any news around them.  


Another thing to note is that in times of a global crisis, domestic news can have a slightly lesser impact on currencies than normal.

Hope this helps somewhat
They actually shorted more lmao. Gonna get absolutely gaped
Do you like money?
