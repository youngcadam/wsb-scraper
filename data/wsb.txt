SE 🚀I’ve been think about that. No way to tell unless they announce it or shares outstanding starts growing. Could be why it traded sideways in the afternoon.Nobody knowsThe value of the TV in the future will be lower. You probably won't find a sucker to buy it. Stocks are different because they offer the potential for increased value in the future based on increase in the cash generation of the business. If apple sells 40m phones today and 80m phones in 5  years it will be worth more in 5 years.

Stocks are also very different because they trade on an active market. At any give time you can see the market price, which is what someone is wiling to pay for at least 1 share (ignore liquidity risk for now).

Again, in your example of Amazon it's not about dividends which is just a method to distribute the value in the form of cash. The value of amazon can remain in amazon indefinitely. If it any point you think Amazon will decrease in the future then you would liquidate your position... which is actually worth more today than if Amazon was giving you dividends over the last 10 years.

> I think to see this, you have to separate yourself from the idea that stocks are automatically valuable and desirable. Ask yourself "why would anyone ever want to own a share of stock?" and drop the assumption that there will necessarily be someone else to pay more for it when the company grows. 

Stocks are just businesses. Businesses have monetary value. Are you saying that businesses don't have value?

> I'm saying that with no possibility for dividends they stop being desirable and nobody wants them. 

If expectations about a business's future earnings or the *actual* earnings are lower than expected then the stock price will decrease.

It is entirely possible that in 5 years from now a stock will be lower because the business is dying. This is investment risk.Tesla alone is worth how many car companies? And all these new SPAC startups which barely have revenue are being valued in the billions? Yes, it's absolutely a bubble, given the actual size of the EV market. This is a lot like the late-90s internet bubble: internet retail and a lot of the concepts companies were inventing were the future, but it was 10-20 years too soon to support the extreme valuations they were getting.ɴᴏᴡ ᴘʟᴀʏɪɴɢ: [Chopin - Nocturne op.9 No.2 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg) ─────────⚪───── ◄◄⠀[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg)⠀►►⠀ 3:00 / 4:30 ⠀ ───○ 🔊 ᴴᴰ ⚙️Interesting

I think its just a professional trading platform, not necessarily options centered.   So here is the thing, sometimes you carry a higher risk of liquidation on PM vs Reg-T Margin, with IBKR you can do a Portfolio Margin Simulator to kind of see side by side how you would do.

This leads to communities being deeply and blindly entrenched in their political and social views.

I imagine you were somewhat saying that rhetorically.

It's interesting. Over every fence our neighbors blindly seriously supported trump. But one by one found a line they wouldn't cross.

Over the back fence, his daughter left him because he supported trump. When he lost the election, his political sign disappeared. Next door, after the domestic terrorists in the capitol last week that neighbor said "maybe this dude is bad after all", an improvement from "I like the guy."

However, the business and family that own the 4-5 properties on the other side?

I saw them flying a "Women for Trump" flag on one of the horses being trained.

They still have multiple trump flags flying.

Funny how those disappeared so quick when they bought into people saying "BLM rioters and looters are coming to town" last summer...

What's sad is all these people are fairly low income or old school middle class. Their kids are feeling the pain of poverty right now (one pair lives in their car in the family's back yard...)

Keeping your breakeven within $1-3 of the price is a great idea, but when a stock is priced to bankruptcy and then retools it's strategy towards profit, a breakeven 25% out of the money isn't necessarily bad

I don’t think Diversification of positions is bad. the best advice I ever got was to learn how to read momentum and then buy slightly OTM options that are at least 6 months out.I'm not trying to be rude, but it feels like you didn't read my comment and then shit on me even though you didn't check if I knew what I was talking about or not. I'd just be careful telling people to "learn options" just because they have a different strategy than you. 

Keeping your breakeven within $1-3 of the price is a great idea, but when a stock is priced to bankruptcy and then retools it's strategy towards profit, a breakeven 25% out of the money isn't necessarily bad

FIn order to get an IPO at the IPO price your brokerage has to participate in the offering, which tends to be normally at larger brokerages for clients that meet specific thresholds, and even then, they will not allocate to all the clients that request the IPO.   

For example on Affirm it priced Jan 13 at night (\~11pm) and then the banks participating in the offering allocate their shares to their clients that have confirmed interest.   Then the next day Jan 14 it hits the secondary market at some point, it could happen an any point in the day.

Let me check my history in case I did it by accident.Which market position would you recommend?Hopefully positivelyThe five stages of institutional shorting failure:

1. Denial. The state of disbelief and rejection of contra-indicators for their failing short position.
2. Anger and bargaining. Fact-free Barron’s hit pieces and massive price manipulation via puts.
3. Depression. Who cares if they’re depressed? Fuck them.
4. Capitulation. Exiting their failed shorts at any price as they pack up their cubicle under armed guard.
5. Acceptance. This happens after they exit the building, so who cares?There is legit painful manipulation with stop loss raids over at AKBA. It’s not for the faint of heart, but when you see that action in level II, you see gains like what GME did today when the squeeze starts.You are grossly misstating what that email said.yeah, > 5% premarketGonna support the cause. 1/22 GME 35c at open if im awakeEven if HK is copying us and not vice versa, that 9988 moon is 🤤.

Which would make sense. The new board members cohan brought did not have shares yet, if they bought as little as 4%-4% and some idiots fomoing in and retails shorts getting margin calls, then it explains the price action.

The fact that it traded mostly sideways after the initual jump and fall is insanely bullish for me. LessgoooooI would literally bet all of my money that gme does not stagnate at 90-100 for a month.Remindme! 74 days ARKXTMG Analysis

Meant to reply to the aapl postMy bad man. Thanks for the info.How?At short time scales there’s an asymmetric advantage to being located close to the exchanges with high speed internet or a direct river connection. And the advantages get even bigger when you’re up against algorithms with ms reaction time. Also the stock market approaches a zero sum game on shorter time scales.

So you are probably betting against the house. Also it’s time consuming.Buyden gonna change that tomorrowYeah I guess west wins on being in line with early work hoursSo is BB a buy or positions/ expectationsExcept it's notHow do you buy 55c?Fuck that school crap - just rob liquor stores and use the cash to buy FDsBased on this news wouldn’t you want to push your calls out to 2022/2023? Why next month?Now that's a bag you can show your friends.Yes they have good news coming out either an acquisition or product release. S&P inclusion by the end of January. Covid super strains and related news is going to keep this stock pushing higherWhy is CCIV the play tomorrow?How does the lame duck president potentially leaving office a week early affect earning multiples?Pump and dump schemes are happening with the use of celebrity endorsements. Can’t make this shit up! 😂😂😂Nice 1 day profit man. I have a question though:
With $200K trading capital, have you thought about just riding the GME uptrend? GME closed at +57% today, so that could've been a potential $114K gain on just one buy/sell transaction.Yeah that bitch, time to buy again I guessHoly shit that’s insane yesIf they are below $1 you are probably just better off buying the stock outright. Leaps are too expensive for long-duration 1 dollar stocks, plus there may be lack of liquidity.I didnt even consider them when refinancing. So naHard to say but look at the short squeeze of Volkswagen in 2008. Quite interesting to look into.lol they sitting right next to you aren’t they?I don't understand we're all retarded here and love risky get rich plays, with even the potential of that in GME why isn't literally everyone in this sub balls deep in this?Are any alternative data free? Also am super interested , please add me in. I have been using google trends to try to spot some data trends but chances are far and fewA 4.85? 4.85???

Let me check my history in case I did it by accident.Which market position would you recommend?Hopefully positivelyThe five stages of institutional shorting failure:

1. Denial. The state of disbelief and rejection of contra-indicators for their failing short position.
2. Anger and bargaining. Fact-free Barron’s hit pieces and massive price manipulation via puts.
3. Depression. Who cares if they’re depressed? Fuck them.
4. Capitulation. Exiting their failed shorts at any price as they pack up their cubicle under armed guard.
5. Acceptance. This happens after they exit the building, so who cares?There is legit painful manipulation with stop loss raids over at AKBA. It’s not for the faint of heart, but when you see that action in level II, you see gains like what GME did today when the squeeze starts.You are grossly misstating what that email said.yeah, > 5% premarketGonna support the cause. 1/22 GME 35c at open if im awakeEven if HK is copying us and not vice versa, that 9988 moon is 🤤.

Right now our world is extremely globalized and our society is interconnected in ways that previous generations couldn't have imagined.

With this technological boom, this creates a demand for space technology that can help improve life on Earth and integrate technology into our economy and society. Satellites are a massive industry already taking place. Anything from weather forecasting to farming require satellite imaging. Additionally services such as disaster monitoring and GPS also require satellites. Then you can think about internet services that require satellites and you quickly realize the need and demand for satellites in space in a world that is constantly expanding in regards to technology and the internet.

To get satellites to space you need rockets and infrastructure. You need companies to build satellites, you need companies to build satellites infrastructure (i.e. ground equipment and communications), you also need companies to launch those satellites to space and then transfer those satellites to their respective orbits. Then, you might need orbital refuelers for long-lasting satellites or perhaps a space vehicle that could pre-maturely deorbit or move satellites around in space.

Already, you can see that there are a lot of systems and companies that are needed just to enable satellites in space. This is because unlike starting something on Earth there isn't I infrastructure already built in space, so there needs to be space-grade developments made on every front. Space-grade electronics, space grade materials, space-grade engineering, space-grade everything. 

Now, imagine all of this infrastructure spread across multiple different space industries. I mentioned satellites, now think about the moon, Mars, asteroids, and space itself. This will introduce asteroid mining companies, orbital refueling companies, space tourism, and a whole swarm of not yet thought of industries.

Why would you use an arbitrary number that provides no context. % of gross sales is a far more useful profit metric than USD without any context to the average vehicle value. Tesla's average sale is ~$60k. There's no way Porsche's is less than $75k.

> Tesla’s automotive gross margins are already among the best in the industry at about 21% in 2019, versus about 17% for Toyota - one of the most efficient automakers, and 10% for GM.

iii) NYSE (Network B) = 1.50/m

iv) OPRA = 1.50/m

More, considering the ongoing squeeze
I've been in emergency medicine for 8 years. COVID 19 is worse today than it has been since it arrived in the US.

Worse yet, Until December, I did not see patients who had been sick longer than 10-14 days unless they had reached the tipping point needing to be ventilated.

I am now seeing more than one patient a day stating they have been "Sick" for 3weeks or more.

I am highly suspicious that I am seeing a new strain, possibly one of the two isolated in Denver, or even a strain yet to be identified.

I'm in the south east

I think if we just contract everything out to SNCF (french company that builds hsr everywhere) we will be fine. They are insanely good at cutting costs. Weird how the French are literally 10x better in cost per mile of track laid. Those fuckers don’t even work.

nah lol but I have one friend that does it all the time
I dont think this guy understands what he's talking abt. Why would a short seller buy puts. They'd sell puts. It's a married put

Spun it 50 times, GME all 50 times. 

GME $50 EOW
cool I'm all in
Yeah do not expect movement anytime soon.
u killed my vibe for a sec not cool bro
this is the way
I don’t trade futures, so I find it cheaper to not pay for the data bundles. For data on just US equities & options I pay for:

i) NASDAQ = 1.50/m

ii) NYSE (Network A) = 1.50/m

iii) NYSE (Network B) = 1.50/m

iv) OPRA = 1.50/m
Should I buy it today?
Tesla 🚀🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
We just need a official announcement and then it’s 🚀 🚀 🚀.
Thanks! I still don't think I understand. Why is 50% short volume the basis for whether the total number of shorts increased or decreased?
yup I see they added longer dated options, hopefully yearlies soon
Once they’re ITM that will 🚀🚀
Enter at the bell. This stock ain't dipping much.
Man wsb had me convinced it was a pnd at 14 on Tuesday and it stayed the same so Wednesday I payed it no mind till I saw it start picking up at market close I was  pissed
Never sell, I felt like it dipped cuz retards here sold at $38, we gotta hold at least $60
What do I buy specifically
Remindme! 74 days ARKX
AAPL was there don’t you worry

Imagine an angry, naked, sweaty, knife toting rudy giuliani being the last thing u see before the void swallows u for eternity

More, considering the ongoing squeeze
I've been in emergency medicine for 8 years. COVID 19 is worse today than it has been since it arrived in the US.

Worse yet, Until December, I did not see patients who had been sick longer than 10-14 days unless they had reached the tipping point needing to be ventilated.

I am now seeing more than one patient a day stating they have been "Sick" for 3weeks or more.

I am highly suspicious that I am seeing a new strain, possibly one of the two isolated in Denver, or even a strain yet to be identified.

I'm in the south east
What if you lose losses? Are you a negative loser?

1750 shares at 17 took profits back in with same amount at 23. Holding forever
citi already tried to stop the fomo. lol
He's definitely gonna be roaring with pussy at the end
I wasn’t aware they were writing $55 yet. It’s not impossible but I’d not hold that through Friday afternoon
All in

Some info here as well on short volume:

There are many beaten down companies where you can invest extra cash. Thats what I started doing by exiting the extra hot equities and booking profits off near hot ones.
Tsm up 4%
And guidance up 25% YoY for the next quarter. I'm genuinely not sure how big that is in context of its runup this past month.
Yeah that caught me off guard as well. China isn’t playing.
How do you walk with balls so large?
Trading fees with Ameritrade is 0.002 per trade I trade stocks only at moment and they don’t charge any platform fees , about losing there is stop loss orders , I always use them never lost after using stop loss

I may be wrong, but CEO isn’t Chairman of the Board. I expect he’ll be around a while. He isn’t necessarily an enemy. Just sayin’.
40$c 1/29?
I looked it up, but I don't fully understand it. All I know is that in order to limit losses, the companies / individuals with these puts that are OTM can buy back shares in a way that raises stock price, perhaps the full 100 shares per put? So that would be 5.1M shares if I'm right, but take it with a grain of salt bc I feel like I don't fully understand it
Most people here view long term as anything over a month.....

Any specific news or just overall faith in the company?
Good infrastructure or commodity tickers?
So not sure if you’re familiar with biotech. The big plays are before then. What you want to play is the NDA. This is the new drug application to the fda. The GFs reviews their data and makes a decision on the PDUFA date. I’d like to point out that AKBA has a priority review voucher worth 100 million bucks to have theirs expedited which usually means <6 months. NDA runs are insane though and that’s way before any approval. You should see 200% runs at AKBA around then. Should be 1-2 months away I’m guessing. They have a real incentive to expedite this as much as possible - their competitor FGEN backed out of their PDUFA date so now AKBA can be first to market. I’ve never been more bullish on a stock right now with AKBA and LMNL

Burry is discounting that Musk is taking the human race to another *planet* in a hurry, making brain surgery robots that connect computers to people’s brains, and bringing 4k pornhub and facebook to every last millimeter of the planet. People don’t invest in Tesla like they invest in GM because they’re not investing in just a company, they’re investing in Musk. 

I wouldn’t short Musk until he steps on Mars (I suspect the mortality rate of Martian visitors is highish.).

It definitely does. I was sure we were talking about dfv, even without seeing his name.
