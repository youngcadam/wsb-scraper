So 1/15 calls are fucked?
r/unexpectedPawnee
The only thing is when it's gonna crash. And some people think that the stock was severely undervalued. So maybe it will only drop like 10 or 15 percent. Who knows. Not me. I just know what short selling is and I read the investopedia page on "short squeeze"
Is there an app that will send me a notification every time there's news about a stock? Not price but news?

Your phone doesn’t matter big guy.
Now ive seen some talk about planter (PLTR) over here and I think it might be a good stock to buy in asap as many people are talking about it, I just wanted to hear some peoples opinions on this
Michael Burry could be right based on the valuations. Or he could be right based on his understanding of how the financial institutions pay their game - pump assets, make a killing and move on. I would be more worried about the latter.

No doubt valuation is very high. But this is a different ball game than mortgages. This is tech with exceptional brand recall. Things move from garages and parents money to being world's richest. Valuations like P/E play a catch up.

Doesn't a short squeeze mean that the price will immediately drop again? Why would you hold on to your shares then? Explain to a noob.
Exactly. 

Ryan and potentially 4 other board members out of the 9 total would lean away from that idea. 

Honestly don’t believe it was ever a real idea to begin with. Almost feel like Ryan and the BOD put on a show before assigning Ryan to the BOD just to see if there would be a greater increase in shorted positions before the ICR conference. 

They even changed their industry slot from retail to technology before announcing Ryan... then all of a sudden assign him and pull out... 

I think they wanted to fuck with every single gay bear from Melvin to Curtis Nagle and see how many shorted shares they could get to before lighting the fuse!!

Can GME pull off a VW type of short squeeze?
Gallbladder*?
Meh...who wants to speak to another human on the phone to place a trade?! No thanks IG.

Another recommendation for Interactive Brokers so that’s good, thank you.
Yes. I called my broker and requested my shares not be loaned to short seller. The rep was all to happy to do so, I think he’s in on it too.
Depends. This can go a huge number of ways which makes setting a price target hard. If the float is smaller than the market thinks it is, which I think is true given Reddit own a non-insignificant portion of the float, and whatever chicanery MMs or Melvin Capital try to pull early tomorrow fails to shake out the paper hands I could easily see this turning into Volkswagen level infinity squeeze territory which means I could see it having an intraday high over $100 aka up 5x from yesterday's open, which is what VW did in 08 when their short squeeze KILLED Goldman and Morgan Stanley and many others. I don't think it will be as crazy as that, but it could easily go to 50-70. It's really hard to speculate on what the PT should be here because of the unprecedented nature of it all. WallStreetBets wasn't here for some of the legendary squeezes and we've seen what markets did without us. This is the first one of its kind and I think it will be one for the financial history books.

Predictions for NIO EOD?
seriously considering to double my position in GME, shorts have barely covered, froday melvins puts expire worthless and they must hedge with longs in order to not get crushed
I’m not eloquent enough to explain how dumb you sound. Believe it or not stocks don’t work the way you describe. Share values are based off fundamentals of the company, profit, and expected growth of the company. When I say growth I don’t mean share price growth I’m talking about future revenue/profit growth.
Squeeze isn’t over
Well here's the thing, if you resell them soon enough so that the the extrinsic value hasn't gone significantly down and the IV is still rocket high, when you sell them you are getting back most of that premium. Doesn't work for the 15JAN ones, but might work for the ones with further out expiry. But you'll be betting on the stock to remain absurdly volatile as it was when you bought them, so if that doesn't happen you'll get IV crushed. Also the ROI might not be as good to warrant the risk, depending on how likely you think the squeeze is going to happen.
This is the way
Mods, this one right here

Underrated comment
Dude no. Sell the option. The fact that it's soo far out in time gives it a lot more value. If you were to exercise it you'd miss out on so much theta. The options value isn't strictly on price of the underlying. Its also due to the fact that it has till April to get there. That makes it way more valuable

Depends on what the risk management department for the big shorts can stomach, they just saw the stock double in price intraday. They’re lucky some of the day traders banked profit and some paper-handed bag holders got off the elevator, shorts doubled down with additional naked shorting to dampen the momentum for the rest of the day.

Inched back up to $33 aftermarket, will probably continue inching up premarket. Short swing traders will run it up some more covering in the morning panic. If there’s a gap up, might see $40 by 10AM. Still a ton of retards on stocktwits thinking this a run-of-the-mill short squeeze.

They can’t keep naked shorting forever but the SEC doesn’t seem to care, look at the insane short float. Who knows. Tipping point might be how much more this goes up tomorrow, if this breakout continues with little correction. After which, if any of the big shorts begins to seriously unwind their positions MOASS happens before the weekend.

At any rate, best to have the color of your lambo or yacht picked out just in case.

GME with Ryan Cohen at the helm means there is amazing fundamental change? That’s why the price is up + new console cycle + unlimited untapped online potential with a tech king at the helm. Honestly should be 50 without a squeeze IMO

I only read top portion, but want to tell you UVXY is a great right now. Selling an $11 CC defeats the purpose of it. Get the shares as a hedge only and prosper.

Did your gf make 60%+ returns on GME yesterday? If no, then maybe you should introduce her to WSB. It's not nice to have a gay bear for a GF
Honestly do it.  I put $700 in last week, and it's sitting at $796 now, and at it's peek, it was up over $830.  I am expecting this to moon.  If you look at the historical data, it had a massive $3 price increase after hours from major buy-ins the other day, and at $20, it's still in really early for where it's going to go.

I will eventually roll my GME tendies into expanding my GOEV, and PLTR positions, unfortunately, not on RH though, since I can't buy for 90 days there (yes, I learned something valuable today, and I am also retarded, but I'm here, so what tf do you expect).
Wow I am absolutely impressed by GME gang. You guys hodled through it all. Tendies well deserved

Dude please don't buy puts tomorrow, you're going to blow up your entire portfolio and wonder what happened. You're the guy that asked in 2008 when VW was supposed to bankrupt "if tomorrow isn't the time to buy puts on Volkswagen when is it?" the day after it jump from 200 to 550 euros a share (yes it jumped over 2.5x a share in day and was around 650 at one point intraday iirc). The only issue with your plan is the next day it broke 1000 euros a share intraday as for that day and that day only it became the most valuable company in the world. Please dude if you're going to buy puts don't buy it with money you can't lose.

Still got time bb. I'd perfer monthlies on goev rather than weeklies but still might print. There is no catalyst yet, consolidating now. Company has sound fundamentals, renowned workforce poached from all over, and a great board. It will send.
The short squeeze will likely continue for a couple more days. Hop aboard GME to the moon!!!

Sorry for the late response, but yes correct. There is upside being priced in. And yes warrants will only go up when stock price rises. It's good to point out that the warrants will rise at a higher % though a $2 change is 20%, if you got the warrants a $2 change can mean 50% depending on your average (Random numbers just for example). Obviously trading warrants is riskier because they are essentially options. 

I usually prefer warrants if I'm swinging, and Stocks if it's for the long term.

$GME
I am curious about something and I hold both IPOE and GME. A week or so ago, when IPOE announced that they were merging with SoFi and that Chamath was taking onto the screens for an interview, trading was halted after the stock went up 30+%. 

However, when GME went up to over 90+% last night, trading was not halted for it to cool off. 

I wanted to ask the community, what are the conditions that will trigger circuit breakers?

BTW, GME 🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀

It’s not GME Gangs fault that you let bias interfere with basic math.

wacka wacka eh eh
Thanks for the quick answer. 

Short answer is selling an aggressive CC limits the possible downward bleed potential of the shares of the market keeps being retarded, because the IV is so high. 

If it looks you get an instant 13.5% return and you can wait for the sale on your favorite bull stocks to end.
400shares and a few 30c for feb !!!!!

So Basically out of 800k you maid 6 Mio! Congrats
Just buy the fucking option🤝
This wasn’t a squeeze. This was bulls.
Some dude said Frankfurt has it opening at 34.16, but who knows
What were you saying about manchildren and GME?
Not just a new console. Significant advances in the console release only. The market thought the Nintendo switch, Xbox one s, and PlayStation 4 pro release was a “next gen console release.” 

It’s only when releases have people trying to buy one every day for months and they sell out immediately when in stock.  

Js because this is a big reason why shorts doubled down like 3 years ago on GameStop. They’re boomers that don’t understand gaming lmao

I literally would if I knew where to actually send it.

If gme hits 100 tomorrow and you exercise you'd make 6,500 minus the premium you paid. 

Also if gme hits 100 tomorrow your call will be worth more than 6500.  You can  get a clear idea of this concept by looking at any in the money strike in April and comparing it to the same strike  on Jan 15th. The January one is going to be worth less, mainly due to the difference in time value. However if both are exercised they'd profit the same. It's much better to not exercise it. A market maker will buy it off you to scalp a few bucks
MAC short squeeze
No
2/19 24c , i tried to squeeze in room for the demo hopefully they come through 🚀🚀

Either we mod him for being a legend, or ban him for making the sub look too good.

Xnet is a good one man i yolo'd and am now praying.

It's modest but to me it's alot. Started at 10k and now I'm at 110k. NIO played a big part in that. I posted here that I missed Tesla at 200 bucks last year and wanted to know the next Tesla and someone said NIO. I did my research and bam here we are.
Yeah ARK is good but of course I was born a Europoor and can't buy that shit in my country. I was talking about the SPY bullshit
Please cum in my wife 😛
My mom names our family Elf on a Shelf “Melvin”

Is this a sign to buy GME shares?

I'm just saying the 500% run up from gamestop in 4 months is not something we'll see from pltr. Most things are priced in, you're going to make a lot of money but y'all are going to have to wait a while. I thought we like making quick money not retirement money. Unless that is your dream,
Its the best browser
For an hour
~50 million on puts no idea about their actual short
Just yoloed my last 3k on GME premarket. Got $122 buying power, what's a good penny to throw this at. Already hit a lick on ZOM and currently holding ATOS for a long play. Gimme penny suggestions you goofy fucks.
That is quite the fucking crossover
So should I buy them on my computer instead
Just ordered my first options ever after casually stock trading for years 

1/15 38C GME$

We are busy pushing GME, what’s the matter!?
I’m ready for the $BIGC train 🚂
Been playing these for over a year lmao also grats and fuck you.
It’s 1am and I’m awake live betting IFT women’s tennis and waiting for GME pre-market number. This is not a healthy lifestyle
Should I FOMO into $GME weeklies tomorrow???
just learned losing a best friend is 10000x worse than a break up. missing my dawgs 😞
this gave me "call an ambulance! but not for me!"-vibes
Doesn't have the money to buy anymore. I bet deepfuckingvalue wouldn't mind donating.
German market has no influence at all lol..
Well, we’ve been shredding and burning documents the past 2 days, several people have been terminated
BUY BUY BUY

BUY SHARES BUY CALLS

ITS YOUR DUTY

WE’RE MAKING HISTORY
Depends on quickly it shoots up within a few minutes and on share price. I think when for GME if it changes 30% in 5 minutes
Little GME has the cheat codes 😎🤫
So what’s better GME or cathie bae?
GME $50 EOW.  You’re good. 💎👋🏻
I just want them to hit $1800
Probably a little down before blast off again
Not sure on the exact numbers but I read they had like 51000 or 80000 FD 24p expiring Friday that they already closed.
Can't stop me WSB nibba.
Sorry for your loss
Here for a good time not a long time
Shortterm: GME
Longterm: Cathie
I tried to help you man not sure what your going on about, probably my fault
What are they
think how much you'd be up if you bought 2 years later at the low
JMIA 🔥🔥🔥
Still better then earning 40k a year imo
Be sure to buy the dip at open then
Yes
Don’t tell me what to do.
