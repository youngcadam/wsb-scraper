Also Robinhood: Congratulations on your free share: SIRIUS XM $5.88 (-1.01%)

Your friend: Trading is boring I think I'm gonna close my account. Anyways thanks for the free Google share or whatever.For the noobies, PLUG was a banned ticker on WSB 1 year ago and if you talked about it you were labeled a “shill” or “pump and dump” 🤡Just got a message that I was permanently banned from r/personalfinance for posting about the ETFs: ICLN, ARKG, ARKK, LIT

The post I commented under was asking about advice on which ETFs they should add to their portfolio, and so I recommend some of the ones that I have in my portfolio. The mods mentioned that I was “trolling” and broke a rule that apparently does not allow people to post about either of those ETFs. 

I was genuinely trying to help. What the fuck.My father died today.  Hug your kids/parents just a little bit longer today.I think I’m addicted to this subredditUsually I'm good with "profit is profit" but my missed profit on PLUG is going to make me sickI day trade TSLA stock options just to feel alive.You motherfuckers who are like:

*cant believe I sold XYZ last year. I’d be millionaire now*


Need to STFU. No one posting in here can hold shit for a week let alone some FLAT shit for a year.YOU SEE A BUBBLE I SEE THE BEGINNING OF A SEVEN YEAR BULL RUN

Thanks Dad, I love you.LMFAO Doordash up 15% get the absolute fuck out of here 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂CRAMER PUMPING CATHIE WOOD OMG DREAMS DO COME TRUE HE CALLED HER QUEEN MIDASICLN gang rise we up 1.3% AHIt's psychologically exhausting to see every play you make, that is well thought out and planned, just tank. And then you have all the plays that you were thinking about making( all the fomo plays) but didn't, just take off and gap up 100% in a week. One time that happens, fine. Twice, you're probably really annoyed. But to have it happen again and again, shit is fucking exhausting. Been trading for years and while I'm happy to see a lot of you make a killing, I'm starting to think whether something like that will ever happen to me. I'm just so fucking sick of losing to the point where it just fills me with anger and disgust. Please universe, throw me a fucking bone. 🙏Biden needs to pass his stimulus right away so I can load up on FCEL and more ICLNcan't believe I avoided PLUG when it was 11$ cuz people were laughing in here for people buying it at that price when they bought it for 3$Making 50-100% gains on EV SPACs I know nothing about other than what I read here is starting to get concerningICLN gang check in 😤😤😤how many people are actually working with accounts over 25k?

Don’t be a haterThe fact that Elon sent a random stock SIGL skyrocketing from \~$6 - $38 by complete accident when people just misunderstood a tweet shows the retard strength behind TSLA. There is no top.Holding these TSLA weeklies overnight. Pray for me.AAPL up 0.09%, more than I could ever have dreamedPlug shares seem like a steal, company is only trading at 200x revenue. That should be much higher!Tim Cook: *Yes the big announcement is that here at Apple we believe in freedom and unity lol*

Genius.My father was a retard, my grandfather was retard, and I am also a retard.**How much $20,000 invested in SPY at the bottom in March is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 1/15/21 $300** strike calls was **2.07**. Lets say we used $20k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

SPY 1/15 $300 calls at the ask price of 78.78 which gives us a total value of:

[https://imgur.com/a/NrC5JJE](https://imgur.com/a/NrC5JJE) 

ICLN had a 'golden cross' moment (my first green arrow from left to right: 7EMA passing 100EMA). As soon as this occurred, there was an influx in volume (400K volume) spike, mostly options driven. Of those options, 73% were bulls (calls) and 27% were bears (puts). Majority lead, bulls. The average price target on options was at a $1.98 above it's current trading value which is $32.34, which puts the majority of the bullish call options around a \~$34 call. As a result, the relative strength index (bottom green arrow) has been tapering around 65%. This indicates potential further upwards momentum. And for those who didn't read this... here are some rockets.  🚀🚀🚀  TLDR: $ICLN Call options in April/July at $34C will print, anticipate the ticker to hit a $34C by Friday post-Biden announcement.

Gonna tell him my net worth is already locked up in TSLA derivatives.Since I started frequenting WSB, the rest of Reddit has become incredibly...bleh, more so than it already was. It's not the whole "too PC" thing either, which I honestly don't care about at all, but people here just take themselves so much less seriously -- it's so refreshing and fun to be a part of.

> THIS IS THE MOTHER OF ALL BUBBLES

Someone call patrick star in here, he can stretch a bubble like a mofoJust late night thoughts... I don’t post much on Reddit but I was thinking VALE is probably going to the moon.

My thought process behind it is Apple is working on a EV. Tesla is dominating the market with EV. Nickel will be in super high demand but the main point is VALE strive on being an eco friendly mining company. Which Apple and Tesla both push for being eco friendly in their companies. If Apple works with another manufacturer they are going to make sure that they play by apples rules. Apple rules mean eco friendly no matter what. Just like removing all charging bricks from phones watch’s and even there wireless chargers. 

So to summarize Apple and Tesla will both need nickel for there cars and VALE is a cleaner mining company. VALE to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes upl gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies report blowout Q4 earnings and give super optimistic guidance for 2021. However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. 

Have a nice rest of the evening folks!

Calls on APPLNice I gambled away all my money and have nothing left to pay for college

Was good knowing youPresident Biden, with the help of a Democrat-controlled House + Senate, will pump $2.4 trillion into the sector during 2021. My prediction is that sometime in the next 5 years, **ICLN** will cost $300+ per share (maybe more). Getting it now is still an absolute steal. Get in now before the real pump happens. This is once in a lifetime opportunity, we haven't seen an infrastructure change like this since the industrial revolution. The dam has broken, and smart money, even oil companies such as Shell and BP, have already started pouring funds into the clean energy sector.

The energy sector is about to turn upside down and clean energy will be the only way to power anything by 2035.

AAPL 420c 1/15The Wall Street Journal online comment section might be the most boomery place in the history of the universe.  Boomers, boomers everywhere! Here is a legit excerpt from our friend David S.:

>I'd rather own Berkshire, and get solid returns over the next 25 years, with minimal risk allowing me to sleep at night, versus something like NIO which could go up 100% the next few years, or very possibly go back down to $10 or so... Young people chasing these high flying EV stocks haven't experienced the pain of the dot com bubble.  And they don't have families to support yet, so "preservation of capital" is not top of mind for them.  They will eventually learn.Bought 25k in PLUG puts 10 minutes before close.

I’ve been shilling ICLN here for a week or so and we’ve made some fat racks, now ima tell you about a ticker just like PLUG.

This motherfucker has been mooning for a couple of weeks now, and hit a whopping **37%** today. As of now it’s trading at **$10.67**

The chart on this grade-A fuckable stock looks just like PLUG, and the best part is the ticker.

That’s right. The ticker is already in space.

Now i’m not a scientist or an astronaut, but I do know that once you’re in space it’s a **helluvalot easier to get to the moon.**

AAPL to the moonCarly Rae Jepsen years ago started as a meme, and now she’s probably the best pop artist in the world.Hot take. I was just thinking, online shopping should be like selling covered puts. Instead of announcing sell, customers bid on prices they are willing to pay for a product, you also have ATM option to purchase now. Like selling puts on a $5k Tv at $4k. The seller has the option to exercise anytime.

Edit: yes like eBay but bestbuy and Costco doing it with all their return customer service etc...Okay, hear me out guys. 
Apple’s big news is this: all stores are for vaccines, and if you get one, you get a discount on the new Hyundai/canoo vehicle, but they will keep tabs on you with palantir, and will partner with Tesla for their batteries. All this while going green by using PLUG to power all their stores. 
That covers all the meme stocks, right?I'm going to say the grossest thing ever. I just buy. I never sell. I guess I'm an investor...?Bears holding out their empty portfolios by the bus stop:

> While Canoo now has the money it sought at the beginning of 2020, that hasn’t softened its ambitions to work with big companies like Apple. The startup said in that same SEC filing that it is “currently in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging Canoo’s technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.” 

My reading of this article is that previous Apple talks fell apart, not that current/future ones are off the table.Apple was willing to buy Canoo, and the executives/board had the confidence in their company to reject the acquisition. Now, months later, they got a partnership with Hyundai and coincidentally Apple is partnering with Hyundai too.So much apple news so little apple tendiesCanoo gang, idk what the fuck happened, but we're waking up on the moon tomorrowAAPL pls flyAnother day, another EV SPAC popping off in my accountI would give my left nut for a massively Green Day tomorrow.🛶🛶🛶 my Canoo calls printing tomorrow!!!

When his next SPAC is announced for either IPOD/IPOF, sell once the stock exceeds 50% gains at opening (calls w/ 500% gain), or exercise your calls if you're a LT investor (which I know none of you degenerates are). Chamath's the best marketer in the game right now. He will make you money, but you have to be positioned.Assuming I have the balls to hold and not sell on swings, is ARKK where I should put my life savings for the next 5 years? Honest questionThis market is gonna trade sideways forever apparently. Every dip gets bought up because people think it’s never gonna go lower. Then every new high gets sold off because valuations suddenly matter at that point unless it’s the Russell 2000. 🤡🤡Feeling like shit because you missed the PLUG train? KTOS is the next rocket.

Population of India = 1.366 billion
Population of China = 1.398 billion
World population = 7.794 billion

Total market of India and China represent 35% of the world's population. 

Therefore, TSLA valuation deserves 35% of the world's total money supply which is $80.9 trillion according to [Business Insider ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/all-of-worlds-money-in-one-chart-2015-12%3famp). This roughly translates to about $30,000 per share.

Thank you Mr. Sanders and Buyden. As the new Budget Committee Chair, Sanders wants to rev up stimulus, and pump cash into the economy to help build it back up. He'll use reconciliation to get most things Buyden wants thru the senate. It should now be fairly easy to get funding for stimulus, healthcare, climate change, etc.

Issuer:  Affirm Holdings, Inc.

Offering:  Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO

The registration statement for Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO WILL NOT be declared effective and the offering priced this evening, 01/12/2021.  Therefore Personal Investments (PI) has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering for the following reasons: 

PI is required by the SEC to obtain confirmations on indications of interest after effectiveness but before secondary market trading in Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO begins.  The Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering is NOW expected to be declared effective tomorrow morning, 01/13/2021 and trading in the secondary market will begin immediately afterwards.  As a result, there would be insufficient amount of time for PI to obtain customer confirmations and complete the allocation process prior to the security's trading in the secondary market.  Therefore, PI has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering.

3.	⁠Add the wet ingredients into the dry and mix until just combined. Lastly mix in the melted butter and stir until combined, the batter will be slightly lumpy.
4.	⁠Set the batter aside while you heat your griddle to medium-low heat. Melt a small pat of butter on the griddle and then scoop out 1/4 cup of pancake batter onto the hot griddle and top evenly with blueberries, as many or few as you prefer.

Thank me laterI just binge ate so hard. Fuck me. This lockdown is killing my gainslicense to kill pump n dumpers who post their gay dds at 4:01pm on fridaysHere sneky, sneky, Snek. Let me touch it.Just thought of the craziest fucking idea. What if scientists find a way to make people immortal but they have to take others people life force away. So when everyone human is born is given a random amount of "years" to live. To extend your life you can take it or transfer it from other people. So the world has rendered money useless and instead people use their "time" as a form of currency. So if you want a coffee well that cost a minute of your life. And your wages are paid in extra time. So in the stock market we can gamble our time and to actually YOLO you can literally die or become immortal.Why are you retards awake?holy shit GOEV 👀Giant green dildo on ICLN 🤑🤑🤑My retired mom bought TSLA shares in the March dip because she heard about it from her boomer friends. Obviously she's up a lot, so she started getting interest in TSLA and decided to sell her paid-off car and buy a Tesla car. Cool, it's her money and she's buying a cool car. The problem is, she called me this morning and told me she ordered a Model S and because she's not using a gas car anymore, she ordered the Tesla solar roof thing, the battery pack, and the Tesla wall charger. She basically dropped $100k on Tesla products because she's up a bit on the stocks. Not only that, when I went to her house to talk to her after the call, I found a poster of Elon Musk hung up next to my dead dad's ashes.

The execs didn’t want to be acquired and Apple wanted an acquisition. That means Apple really wanted access to the skateboard technology.

And now, almost a year later, Apple is talking with Hyundai who is partnered with Canoo. If Apple wants Canoo’s skateboard tech this badly, other companies will want it as well.“CCIV is crashing”

I've seen very few stocks be able to maintain any upwards momentum when they get that stretched. There will be at least one fat red daily candle for you to profit off of. Just have to get out once you get that red day or two, don't baghold.

Part of the reason why this works is because 90 on the daily is just crazytown. TSLA has only managed it once or twice. PLUG is actually still below 90 as of close today.Lottery grand prize is over 1 Billion dollars. Going all in.

What if apple partners with Tesla to produce its apple car. Elon knows about it and decide to make the apple tweet- as a way of cryptically telling us? 

Tim apple said we have something huge that isn’t a product— an apple car produce by Tesla. Would be huge. 

Not a product but a partnership. Paired by musks tweet today— you’re going to make it.

Tesla "Model $25k" being accelerated to 2022 is 𝙝𝙪𝙜𝙚 news: previous assumption was 2024-2025, and few TSLA valuation models include it.

Thanks jim say hi to the kidsIf you’re wondering why TSLA is not mooning on good news it’s cause all the good news about TSLA is priced in and it already mooned ladsDumb question but why do some of my upvotes show in red and then sometimes they are in green?How do you guys find all of these retarded companies?Angry orchard really isn’t very good tbhSince all of you are going to be rich soon I have some real world advice. If you fly less than 150 hours a year private do not buy your own private jet! Also if you do PLEASE for the love of god make sure the engines are on Corporate Care / Gold. Fucking things are $$$ and just because you have 3000 hours before TBO does not mean some Mechanic Jackass will not say one needs a overhaul / replacing during the annual!Fuck me.

###How many ANAL GoDs are there...?NGA CEO starting the day with Benzinga interview in the morning then heads over to a conference presentation on why they’re the shit.  Rumored ending the day with a Mad Money interview.

At pixel time, the French car company’s shares are up 1.5 per cent to €36.80 on the news. That gives it a valuation of just under €11bn.
Yet in early trading, Plug Power’s share price is up 17 per cent to $62.36, giving it a market capitalisation of $30bn. Yes, that’s billion with a ‘B’.
So, in short, the press release caused the market to forecast that the discounted value of Plug Power’s future cash flows from this joint-venture agreement will be worth almost exactly a third of Renault’s market value (which, as a reminder, is the discounted value of its total future cash flows).

If I buy a call option and the contract goes up in value and then I sell it before expiration, do I then owe the person I sold the option to the underlying shares at expiration if it’s above the strike price? Or is that the person who originally sold me the options contract? 

I’m tempted to trade options once I’m 18 but I really don’t want to be one of those guys who goes into negative balance cos they had no idea what they were doing.

At pixel time, the French car company’s shares are up 1.5 per cent to €36.80 on the news. That gives it a valuation of just under €11bn.
Yet in early trading, Plug Power’s share price is up 17 per cent to $62.36, giving it a market capitalisation of $30bn. Yes, that’s billion with a ‘B’.
So, in short, the press release caused the market to forecast that the discounted value of Plug Power’s future cash flows from this joint-venture agreement will be worth almost exactly a third of Renault’s market value (which, as a reminder, is the discounted value of its total future cash flows).

Find a stock you wouldn't mind owning that is a good value. Dividend stocks are bad for this.

Buy a call and sell a put. Both at the money. Total cost $0. Have the put be cash secured. If the stock goes up, sell some of the calls (not all) and all of the puts. Now you have all the upside of calls and no downside. You can move on to the next stock and repeat.

If it goes down you will just end up owning the stock.

AOC has a man faceMango on TV earlier bragging about his great border wall, talking about coyotes and illegals waiting Biden's term to get into the "gravy train" that is democrat policies.

Dude, Democrats aren't exactly going to open the door and wave people through (see MAGA Capitol police) they are however going to improve international relations.

To be insane tomorrowI put 5k into a  SPY Jan 21 2022 485c. If market does 30 % next calendar year it is worth 30k.... If SPY does 40% next year it turns into 155k.  Thinking of doing another chunk into QQQ and IWB. Shit IWB did 50% since the March low. Buy and diamond hand.

Edit
Yea I'm a retard... They are 2022 fixed it. again 40% is top end. I make a decent return with 30%. You don't think full dem control is going to open the infrastructure money gates?Anybody here ever fuck a girl that told you she just sees you as a friend ?fuck i’m too scared to see TSLA premarket I wanna just sleep first so I don’t worry about it# HOLY MEGA GREEN DILDOTracking ICLN Euro holdings at open, with weight rank:

There are so many missing commas in this thread. So little correct punctuation, capitalization, etc. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, SPY to 385 EoW.Oh my god GOEV after hours I am going to fucking cumI honestly think Tesla will hit 900 EOW but definitely 870 tomorrow we tested it today but didn’t have the trading volume to past itIsn’t GME’s ultimate game plan entirely like Blockbusters? Blockbuster realized it was losing market share and copied Redbox and tried to get video on-demand but was too late and died. Coronavirus + new console was saving grace for GME but let’s be honest — you didn’t try to get that PS5 at GameStop. You first tried Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart before succumbing and standing in line with the neckbeards who sell new releases back for under the going eBay price. 

I know you all are only here for the short squeeze but I get a bad feeling about investing certainties. Something tells me your timing will be off and theta and IV will screw you. Well, good luck then.AOC is life rn 👀

Rode the 2000 tech crash to become a millionaire at 15 years old.

Used AOL IM to hook up with milfs and I could be your daddy.Imagine being a bear. SPY hits another milestone at 380. You give it your best shot and think that this is finally it. SPY spends literally half an hour below 378 and instantly bounces. You know now in your heart that those 375P will expire worthless as we blast right through 380.

Oh well, no way it goes to 390!!I want to put it in Pelosi’s pooper.Don’t ever let anyone, for any reason, convince you that anime is not a legitimate form of entertainment.

* Upstart AI lending platform, aggregates consumer demand for loans while connecting network of bank partners enabled with Upstart AI
* Significantly faster and more accurate than traditional lending models. This reduces loss rate while increasing the number of approved applicants 
* Recent IPO (Dec 16th), some big ol’ gains since then

They appear to be the only big player in their particular niche at the moment. If they establish a strong partner network it seems likely to provide a deep moat and solidify their position.

Or... the pump and dump is coming in fast and hot.

While Canoo now has the money it sought at the beginning of 2020, that hasn’t softened its ambitions to work with big companies like Apple. The startup said in that same SEC filing that it is “currently in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging Canoo’s technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.”

FuckWHO IS DOWNVOTING? I will find you and upvote you!Who else is gonna buy this TSLA dip tomorrow? I heard its gonna get as low as 780!Plug almost gets me going as much as AOC🤤Today’s  moves. Had a good position in plug today made best gains I’ve ever had. Decided I wanted more exposure to hydrogen so I dumped meme stock nio which I fomo into yesterday for small loss, (people on Instagram were even pumping it yesterday, the echo chamber got to me, it was like I was fucking being subliminally programmed or some shit) put that shit into bldp when it was at $34. BLDP is leader in hydro for transit, buses, trains etc and it had a news release today about  a newly secured contract. rt it’s absolutely ripping ah so seems like a good move. Otherwise after seeing some gain porn on wsb about a dude make 20k off of 200$, put some speculative money on aqms. Made a grand on eng, don’t know why it shot the fuck up, it looks like a regular engineering consultancy that will struggle to compete with arcadis and Jacobs, but it’s meme stock with a cute ticker so a lot of autists.

On the bio side tried  getting more of Dtil but spreads too wide. Speculative position on ziop. Bought $500 worth of stock in amrn don’t know why except my cash needed to be parked  somewhere.

Tomorrow... really confused about eng. will probably see if I can trade it more or something or take out a small $200 dollar position, but the max leap is like july which is disappointing. May also speculate on fuel tech, ftek, another $200 or so. But really I shouldn’t make any moves. It’s wise not to feel like you should trade every day, but I’m a retardSo extremely bullish on TSLA, we dip for one day, then we pump for a week. Today was day 1, strap inJust curious, are any of you little shits from Nashvillewould lex luthor be an incel if he wasn't mega rich?How fucked are my Apple 130 calls that expire this Friday I bought at today’s dip ?

* The market went overbought on Dec. 2.
* The market will remain overbought until Jan. 13, 2021.
* The Big Money Index will peak on Monday, Dec. 21, 2020, at an S&P 500 level of 3,731.56.
* The S&P 500 will peak on Jan. 18, 2021, at a level of 3,828.50.
* The S&P 500 will then subsequently fall until Monday, April 19, when it will trough at 3,341.81.

Deadass they try so hard to play a good role in the movie, especially Gandalf (Ian Mckellian)!Guys, I think I’ve figured out what Palantir does and how they can actually expand their core products and business. I work with the network security field and to me besides business intelligence their core focus for their products is cyber security with the core product for commercial use being asset and information tracking and mapping. To me that can expand their product going one of two routes. Create APIs that also integrate with existing cyber security systems and build their data sets to also be able to analyze and track actual network analytics from the perimeter and multi site management of network security assets similar to solar winds, but also be able to build it out so network traffic from malicious entities can be tracked within the UI so notjust for hunting and locating criminals but mapping attackers, the partners in attacks of a network, and using that information to identify the location and identity of the attacker. They could even build the system out to track where malicious software originated. 

They can truly build this out and customize it in truly unique ways. It can be a platform for physical security, cyber security, or simply to asset tracking and logging as in covid. This company isn’t just building with military in mind if you think about how they can expand their existing platform to even integrate with big players like Cisco and Palo Alto with APIs.You guys gotta stop trading on emotion.

Like, for a place that is all about betting and gambling they sure treated an ETF as if it was TESLAWrong. $400 EOY.Nice man!Should be tagged DD.

Retail sucks.I’m holding through earnings!sorry for your loss bro 😢 may he rest in peaceI’m sorry for your loss. Praying for you and your loved ones.calls on good dads, sorry man :(Sorry for your loss man. Beautiful post. He sounds like he was an amazing dude.I'd give you a wholesome award if I had one. I'm sorry for your loss and I'm glad that you loved your dad back and recognized your love for each other. It's not as common as you may think.RIPPrayers up my manIm sorry for your loss! You will always have the moments you spent with him.. and sometimes memories are the only things that stay forever ♥️RIP to him dude...he will always be with youHere’s a hug man 🤗.

Incredible, you’re so lucky to have had that. Hang in there and cherish the moments you had. Thinking of you.Do you own gme?Uh... why haven't you just bought TSLA calls. I'm up 20k this year on that alone.Bro honest advice take a month or two completely off. Don’t trade, don’t get on WSB, don’t look at the market just do other things. Come back less emotional and get ready to profit 🤘Try entering with a small position and then averaging down. Everything goes up eventually. That’s what I’m trying to do nowDo you try any momentum plays? It’s like, we all know many of these meme companies are complete crap with a few exceptions...just try to hop on and ride the train vs. doing a weeks worth of DD and missing it. 

If you’re buying tech/ev/genomics stocks lately it’s fucking easy mode. Just don’t get greedy and have an exit strategy. Sell the shit companies for short term gains and use that to buy shares of companies you believe in for the long term.What are you invested in now?Do you want a bone, or a ticker, strike price and date?If you are consistently losing Just do the opposite of what you want to doJust start inversing yourself. Looks like a shit play but retards on WSB have relatable emojis for it so they like it? Calls. Company looks like it has a lot of potential, you’ve spent hours doing DD and the company seems to be ready for take off? Puts.just take a break and start swinging/ stop weeklies/stop watching market.Dude. Buy. Fucking. Shares.Time to change strategies. Maybe your processes for choosing stocks are all wrongI don't know if this is what you're doing, but don't buy into the hype on certain stocks being hyped on WSB.  I've learned that by the time a lot of them are being hyped, they've already had a parabolic run, and are starting to level out or crater.  If everybody is talking about it, it's probably too late.Yeah man, I don’t think this is for you. Literally any tard could’ve made money this year. VTI and chill from now on?

Also I always pull any speculative profits and throw them into the main index fund account. 

You're right to be weary of the advice from people here.

CumExercise early in the morning when you wake upFeel you bro, others have already given you good advice, I would add watch some r/aww b4 bed.
And the underlying cause is probably stress, figure out why it's happening and a way to bring it down (meditation, exercise, physical activity, traveling, hell just relaxing in a hammock can help)I had 1 year of chronic insomnia in college, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. The main cause of it was initially anxiety, later on I found out when you don't sleep properly, yourbody starts to produce less and less sleep hormone and mix that with anxiety and then you created negative feedback loop of long term insomnia. Solution? Like other people said you have to replenish your sleep hormone, start taking melatonin supplements. If you want something natural, eat a banana and drink a glass of milk before you sleep. It really helps. Reverse psychology, start telling your self it's ok to not sleep instead of stress yourself out of it. They may just calm you down and help you sleep better. Also try to remove as much anxiety from your life as possible. That's the key to get your sleep back.

🧑‍🚀🔫🧑‍🚀Diamond hands here.......  ICLN Gang.950 EOWjoe manchinThe stock needs a 35% move to break even. I don't know why I keep telling people this... I'm the one selling them. Tons of iv baked in.Underwhelming green new deal? I’m long Icln though just postulatingPLEASE PLEAE DON’T YOU WILL HONESTLY LOSE A LARGR CHUNK OF YOUR MOOLA. 

Why?  It’s what I call the WSB INDICATOR.  
During any given week couple of week and if very lucky a month max.  There are a 2-4 stocks many “investors” better said degenerates including myself pile into. 

The first ones to go into the trade makes the most.  Logically they / we all advertise our positions in hope others also join. The ultimate dream is to find and sling calls on the next meme stock. 

However you can tell when it’s getting very hot and you need to sell or definitely not be the last dumbass buying at the top.   Maybe there’s still some room on ICLN however we are way closer to the beginning of a correction than a new lengthy pump.   

Scroll around and you’ll still find the poor souls asking when PLTR will pump again as they got killed and refuse to sell.   

Not saying ICLN is a bad idea, just think it’s horrible timing.  I’d also add PLUG, FCEL and even TSLA to this list.  There are sooooo many good stocks find one which gone up 20% in the last week.   

Check MSFT it’s been a dog and they are reporting at the end of the month. Without a doubt they will post fking amazing numbers.Could be making more doing something else. It’s not a bad position, but you askeddepends what exp. eft moves slowThere is none lol even dipping down today those leaps increased in value. 
PLUG & ENPH will carry ICLNPLUG is weighted at just over 8% of ICLNs holdings after today, if it pulls back we might see some red. I strongly believe ICLN is going to pump, here’s some rockets as proof 🚀🚀🚀too much moneyICLN has been artificially blaoted by retards on this sub. It may drop before it gets chugging again.

Additionally, there are other green etfs that may provide you more profit.

A loan on a car? LOL couldn’t be meFuck no. Use that money to make money!!!Never buy a new car if you like moneylol... howd you go from 40k to 400k...Get it. But not at that interest rate. If you’re buying new then you can find a better deal. Go to the dealership and tell them the only way you buy is with lower interest rates and they’ll work it out for you.Why don’t u run the wheel in a stock u will keep  and finance itHow much do you add to the market? Or are those gains? I’m 24 about to buy a motorcycle with my tendies. You might break your legs when you’re thirty or have kidsDo it but murder it out or sum shitMaybe buy a 2019  I mean it's already depreciated a little and it's the same carCongratulations on your success. Can confirm, a great feeling. 

Otherwise shut the fuck up.4runner gangBuy a Tacoma instead and trick it out. Even a Tacoma that’s old af is still well over 10k if it’s taken care of4Runners retain their value really well. But you seem like the type that would make it a lifelong vehicle 🥶Bronco 🎠G-ClassHow did you 1,000% in a year? Congrats dude!

P.S.
Get the car if it brings you joy. Money shouldn't be the end in of itself but rather a means to the end. And in this case driving a 4Runner TRD is the end.Stfu and don’t be a retard. You know what to doIf you are into modding cars as a hobby, that car isn't too outlandish given your net worth, but you should pay it cash (or at least half of it) if you are still yoloing/trading on margin in your brokerage account. I don't think your monthly payment should be over $300 but that's just me.

I'm driving my camry into the ground (it's almost 9 years old, 55k miles on it since I dont drive much, and I should be able to drive it for another 50k no problem). When i got it my age was similar to yours, net worth was lower but I made more per year.Looks like a sweet ride, and Toyota is a fantastic brand. 

Congrats manI wouldn’t recommend it. I bought a 2006 Volvo sedan for $7k cash 6 years ago when I was worth $75k. I’m now at $3.5m and will do the same when this one car is done. New(er) cars are vastly overrated.You earned that money, now spend itBuy an old land rover defender and mod thatNo, don’t waste your money on a car. It doesn’t sound like you actually want it. Instead, it seems to be a whim.

Think about the bigger picture. Car is depreciating asset. A toy in your case basically. I’m sure you will find better alternatives that don’t cost as much. Also, the economy is not doing well. Chances are, things will get worse down the road. Save the money and invest or buy assets that at least maintain their values in inflation.[deleted]They got the nachos taco for 1.29.

It might feel like constant suffering but there is no joy without suffering. A divorce, losing someone close, etc only hurt so much because they brought you so much joy. Adventure on brother, it’s scary but a journey worth havingI used to feel this way, so I started to travel more and more and this gave me life again.

But this one has an apple logo so...if you're paying for apple services, App Store purchases, and SUBSCRIPTIONS there's no reason not to just get it for the 3%Get an Amex (as long as you plan on continuing paying off on time) or a chase sapphire reserve. Chase good bc the points are a little more valuable to me than Amex, but both good. I have an Apple Card as well as the other two, and it’s useless. Got it for the memes.

It's the decent thing to doLast earnings it didn't crash as hard as it typically does immediately after earnings, but it did crash none the less. If you have calls I'd offload them asap, stock I'd hold on to unless you bought near the top.Why not?Probably glitch.  TDA shows 104.35volatility will kill you once or twice and wipe out all your gains from the weekly sells. They are covered calls so you still make some money but theres better ways to invest 13000. 

For this strategy I would look at SPY a little more money and volatile but you have 3 expirations a week so you can sell much more against it with a shorter time horizon.

You don't necessarily need to buy 100 shares for the spy strategy you can just buy a call 6-8 months out and then roll the profits into another one 6- 8 months and not let the theta catch your call if its not moving into the money enough,

I started doing this right before September crash and still broke even after the elections.Do it. AAPL moves steady enough to make good $ selling CC’sIt’s kinda shitty. At 127 I sold a Cc for $130 and only got like $100 bux for it. It ended up shooting to 132 so i ended up worse off by the time it expired.Or use the same money to buy LEAPS and sell even more CCs.

Vanilla and smoky flavors that usually only come with higher shelf stuffEvan Williams bottled in bondAll of these mentioned are great! I want to add four roses to the mix tooEvan Williams bottled in bond or wild turkey 101.Best bourbon under 100$ is eagle rare. If you can find it, it’s 39$. 2nd place would be woodford reserve. You can find easily in every liquor store for 32$. 

They are both made under the Buffalo trace distillery. The same distillery which makes pappy van winkle. 

If you’re broke like most retards, then Jim beam black is 20$ and by far the best bourbon at that price point.

Weird, who woulda thought...Anyone getting the hint????From all the information I’ve gathered, steel isn’t that long of a play. It’s expected to go up due to high demand and low supply around summer, so get like June calls... Anything around August should be fine. I wouldn’t get a call 2 years from now. Just my 2 cents.Safe maybe but dont 3xpect to see any return in your investment until maybe a year and a half in. It will trade sideways and fluctuate a lot until then because no one knows for sure what will happen with the stock a year and a half from now. I would strongly suggest looking at calls for April and June for VALEhttps://youtu.be/7hhQLozezakYahoo Finance, any good broker, NASDAQ appBecause there’s a lot of SPACS and some takes months, even more a year to find a target... Your money might just sit there doing nothing at all. I suggest you find a good SPAC with a team you believe in like Chamath and hold those, still no guarantees. You’ll get like 2x return from NAV on average right before merger, but a lot of plays could’ve gotten you more...

SPY 420 EOMBullish.Market doesn’t careI bought covid calls🚀BullishPriced inlast time i did everyone laughed at me and called me ninja for monthsread a book on options or watch a course online. ur question is so wrong on a ton of levelsYou essentially sell the call at its new premium price and you take the profit on top of your initial investmentYou seem innocent... get off this sub while you can and come back after watching some tastytrade videos and reading r/optionsIf you’re exclusively buying options you won’t go negative.  Don’t ever think about the “other” side of the party if you aren’t holding to assignment, it’s completely irrelevant.  You buy to open a call, it goes up, you sell for profit.  That’s it.  They’re basically highly leveraged shares.  

Obviously that’s an extremely simplified view.  DM me if you have other Q’s.You can only can only go negative of your original investment if you are writing calls on shares you own.Thank god you didnt make a post about it.

If you buy a contract and sell it before expiration, you shouldnt owe anyone shares. You opened a position by buying, and closed it by selling. Remember, (buy to open) and (sell to close)   


If you SELL TO OPEN, you're going to put down cash to cover (sell puts to open) or shares(sell calls to open). But if you arent SELLING TO OPEN, then you shouldnt worry about any shares/cash you have to hand over at expiration.Some investopedia and YouTube videos will be wayyy better resources for this question

P.S. - probably just start buying stonkThis will help you;

Roughly 500 million in cash on hand and will have a lot more with the store closures 

Hugely undervalued at 1billiin Market cap 

And to top of all the fundamentals.... Possible setup for the greatest short squeeze of all time, hence the GME gang spam here and discords full of excitement.

Even without the mother of all squeezes happening.. With Cohen at the helm.. This stock ain't a meme anymoreCohenI’m with you, just trying to figure out what could Cohen’s strategy be.  Game developers are skipping the middle man (retailers) and any future game will simply be just come as any other soft wear product and update.  

Gaming continues to grow and if there was an applicable none brick n mortar distribution model other companies such at Netflix would have pounced on it.  I just don’t see it.  He’s done great with Chewy however they sell actual physical products (just making a spread on used and new consoles isn’t sustainable specially not at that valuation).

Oh well, Porsche gonna have to wait I guess 😩radPltr is up dogThis is why we hold til exp 🤣Get fucked kiddo. Sold 1100 shares @ 21, bought at 14.70.Should they call it the E-150 or will that piss off the loyalists?Yup, bought in 2 months ago and planning on holding for 2 years at least, cant go wrong with Ford if you hold long, their potential EVs can end up raising the stock prices substantiallyAfter your options expire probablyYou use a Samsung or Android phone don't you.

Nah maybe 4/20/2024not really, there's way too many other problems rn. maybe next.My massive TLRY position sure hopes soDon't think this year but I do see a lot of talks happening with it being finally done 2022 or at worst 2023 but with Democrats holding all three branches and many, many other countries legalizing it I don't see why it wouldn't be sooner than later.yeah, they need the taxes and to chill people the fuck out.Yes.   Democrats want to rush in with a win and sentiment for legalization is at a high, with other countries and the UN lowering the schedule of marijuana.  
Also at the debate it was mentioned as a top priority to avoid police using easy racial profiling with cheap tactics.   I don’t have much invested, but I think this will have a strong push right away. 
Will also be an opportunity for Republicans to save some face on something that most people want or don’t care if it’s legal or not.I bought fubo just a few minutes ago lmaoOld and priced inI have shares, I still like it until I hear from earnings reports (within the next 6 months) that the slack integration has been going poorly. I won't touch options on CRM though (well, unless I see a lot of volume/activity, then maybe), will likely just bleed for weeksWhat did you see huge volume on specifically?You’d have better luck with your fortune teller down the street, go for itThat's roughly a 66 percent jump in market cap in one year. You'd be in a much better position to do slighty OTM spreads and just diamond handing those for a year if you want max gains. Not saying it can't happen but that's a lot of growth to expect for a company as large as AMZN in a yearthinking of doing this myself. but it also ties up a lot of capital and may not go up much. AMZN can go sideways for 1.5 years before gapping up if u look at its price chart that is what worries me.buy under $60I sold mine!!BanBANYou have a pool? Life ain’t all bad!ARKK,ARKGICLNBOTZPBWHACK, cyber security etfStep one: sell callsSell weekly 1000c.You mean you have $40,000 in shares and not 40,000x shares I assume. 

If you don't have 100x shares most brokers will not let you sell only partially covered. TD won't let me, it throws an error

So I hold 100x shares of TSLA and during consolidation I can make an easy $1k a week when in consolidation. When it's skyrocketing I will try to wait for the top and sell an ITM call for maximum drop protection

But right now TSLA isn't going down and I'm afraid it will rip another 8% randomly 😂It’s pretty simple, look at sell call premium and that is your answer for each date and strikeWhenever TSLA gets near a $50 or $100 mark sell ITM calls then set a bid to buy it back for $20 less

It’s bounce back a little like it always does and you get free lunch foreverWell, no, cause you need 100 shares to sell a call and you only have 40k so it's not 100read some of Gary Black's tweets about selling covered calls on TSLA. think he tends to sell ~10-15% OTM weeklies after big pops

but also, if you only have $40k in TSLA shares that isn't even 100 shares, which is what you would need to sell a single covered call.Something something too big to failall the currencies r fuk therefore none r fuk?Go read The Accidental Superpower by Peter Zeihanyes go all inThey’re making an announcement about the announcement for their next announcement[deleted]TSLA at 852, so it will be at 2852 after announcement.I wrote in 2k stimmy for president so it should be 2kplease don't teach them math rnFirst month probably 1400 next month 2k.

\-Bo BurnhamNot really, your sell call is gonna eat up a lot of premium. You would be better doing debit monthlies.I mean they do... but some bullshit like an ATM long call and slightly OTM short call is just sloowwwww fucking money.

Figure your target price, timeframe, then figure out what's maxing your leverage given those constraints. Could be a striaght-up long call, could be a spread.

Very high IV, maybe a deep OTM spread with potential for 400-500% return potential makes sense.

The shale producers are increasing rig count, but slowly and not taking on debt to do it.

She stormed away but my frat brothers sure got a kick out of itThere is no way that this can actually be enjoyable for anyone involved.I figure at the end of this week I can probably make that happenCool if she's into itI had a girl who wanted me to, so we settled on in the shower. Did nothing for me but I am a hopeless romantic and can't say noCool thanks for the infoI have a few times. These chick and I were fucking drunk one night and I was railing her and had to piss bad.  So I said hold on a I gotta piss. She said do you wanna piss on me. This was the kinda girl where if you show even the slightest hint of indecision or lack of confidence she wouldn’t fuck you 

So I took he hand out her in the tub and pissed on her tits the came on them. She loved it. Was my first time and was wild. But the sex was insane and I thought it was weird but some of my buddies have similar stories. 

She wanted me to piss in her mouth but I didn’t do it. 

I say if she wants you to piss on her then do it. No biggie. Chicks like that are fun to smash.

Euro and NZ holdings were blood red today (and in the case of NZ, down again for “tomorrow”)Weight in the ETF is everything. Plug has 7%, do you know how many more stocks exist in the market that make up that other 93%? A ton of them and early today most weren't going up. PLUG is a meme stock it's on a different trajectory. It's just a matter of how much a stock is going up in the market at that moment and its ETF weight. That is all. No time delays, same as any other normal stock.There are these things called buyers and sellers that determine the price in the free marketAs I understand it there are weighted averages, etf share price reflects thatI would like to know as wellIt’s Thursday my fellow autist.Thought it was ThursdayPretty sure it's Thursday Jan 14its thursdayYou're obviously living in the future.

Take cuck bozzos away.Imagine thinking you were the one that told everyone about PLUG lmaoI had a chance on Friday. By some rando autist. Should of done it. At least my ICLN is doing alright. Waiting for uncle Joe to make a speech.Nothing alike.  Literally had no cares in the world in 1999.  US had no enemies (most were aware of anyway) and we were still the only super power.  Interest rates were also like 6% or some shit.  Way more optimism in general back then.Long way to go before we hit those days.  Imagine March free fall but in reverse.   Can’t wait for that to return.  This is a good ole fashion melt up in a bull market.  Stay strongOne day the dips wont bounce and bulls will give back all their money "dip buying" and then chasing their losses until you see a big fat fucking capitulation as WSB lets out a collective "Guh".Nah, Plug literally went to 1000, this is nothingSame thing happened last Feb 2020lmfao 30 to 40 hell nawLmao ford has almost 200 billion in debt.

Some fucker even said I was racist for lumping all China stocks as CCP controlled. Its a government, not a race of people. Fuck me. Vindication was so sweet yesterdayUsually 50%-100%. Let my FUBO calls ride to 150% today because it didn’t show any signs of stopping. I’ve definitely missed out on some gains by selling too early, but profit is profit & I’m up 50% on my whole portfolio since I started 3 months agoNot long50% upSell it, take the money... come back with an exit strategy next timeGenerally when I start asking myself that question.  I don't play weeklies.  I buy 3-4 months out, and if they make a bunch of money in month 2, I'm fine selling and finding another fish to catch.always try to buy more than 1 contract so you can Sell enough to make back your initial investment and then let the rest rideSell and rebuy something elseone way to hedge is to sell enough of the contracts that your initial cost basis is covered, then you're playing with house money and can let the rest ride to expirationBoth?No it looks like it will not go up for most likely the rest of the trading week and possibly into the next.

MACD : Flat on 5 min, 15min, and 30min. Downward trend MACD line coming off highs for the one hour chart, but has not entered bearish territory. 

MVWAP vs. SMA: The indicator is giving mixed signals, but is mostly pointed towards flat in the near term with the indicators crossing alot over the trading day on the 5 minute chart. On the 15 minute it does show that the MVWAP has crossed SMA which is a bearish intermediate term indicator. But on the 30 minute chart the lines have yet to cross and the price has yet to sink to test these level, which still does give us a more bullish stance. 

Volume and RSI looks to be pretty low as well and nothing exciting developing there. The NIO Day hype train was fun while it lasted but we have a lot of people taking profits off the table for the time being. 

So if you ask me, it looks like it will test some support levels at 61, and 59.50, before we start to see another rally behind it. Which makes perfect sense as it would be about a 10-12% retreat from the all time highs. 

So yeah, time to find something else in the meantime.

The thought is that the debt will reduce as things return to normal and as loads of people will want a holiday via air travel this summer should be very good for airlines.Fellow countryman here, bruv. KLSE doesn't make much sense to me. I don't have the data but the number of retail investors is relatively small, hence the real market movers are the institutions (EPF, PNB, KWAP, etc.). 

I've stopped monitoring local counters but if you see an opposite reaction to the overall market sentiment like you pointed out, chances are they're probably gonna release some good news in the next couple of days (maybe Gov free/low-interest loan or bailout?) and the big guys have all bought in. Same goes for bad news. Check out who the big sellers of AirAsia couple days before the Founders were investigated for kickbacks.

That said, right now they are possibly a bit high if there is a general market pullback. If they dip below $90 again I am going in on some LEAPs for next year, like $150+ strike

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

Rudeness towards other Redditors,

Spreading incorrect information,

Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s

Saying the N word without an N word pass

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.Who’s gonna tell him...Nice DDFor what? Weed dealers in east coast r at basketball courts😂 and bars or clubs for white and pills .

Date?? The most you can lose is the 100$ you paid for the premium, when it expires worthless if its still below the strike price...Only the $100 will be lostThe premium you paid for the option is the maximum risk, if the option expires below the strike price it will be worthless.If it goes to expirey still below the strike, it expires worthless.BanYou are not obliged to buy it. So when buying calls you either win with the difference or loose the cost of contract.if it expires in the money you’ll buy 100 shares at the strike price of 130, unless you don’t have enough buying power in which case the option will get sold an hour before close.

2) QQQN doesn't have options on Robinhood. I wrote this specifically for options play.

3) QQQJ has more liquidity than QQQN which is important when it's time to unwind.

4) QQQJ has more non-tech companies, which are still relatively beaten down and yet to recover, compared to QQQN.

5) All that said, if you're fine with stocks, then QQQN is also a good play.I'm so thankful I've found this sub. I've never lost so much money so fast in my life!

I had no debt and and my total monthly expenses were $1,250. I was saving 30% of my income into 401k and still yoloing for fun. Now just my mortgage is $1,250 and utilities and all that shit are so much more. So in short yes.That's what's stopping me tbh. Plus I like the freedom of renting but I dunnoI have 7 rental properties and it’s a fucking nightmare. Landlording blows and I’m not giving up 10% for manager. But have fun unclogging their sinks and drains and ant infestations and all the other gross shit that happens all the time.Because now you owe someone 600k you son of a bitch what do you thinkBuy a rental home first to split the costs, and then buy a home. Saves you a ton of headaches in the future and gives some play money after overhead is covered.It’s just so fucking expensive in ways you never even realize. I did not realize how nice it was to call the landlord because my garbage disposal was leaking and he just sent a maintenance guy to come fix it. A few months after moving in my toilet started leaking and i spent hours on YouTube learning how to remedy and the materials weren’t even cheap. I’m gonna sell and go condo route i think.Yeah fr.

I drive enough that in the 5 years I own it I’ll get to 100k or more miles. By then it’ll be paid off, worth 20-25k still, and I paid zero interest and the only expense I worry about is fuel and maintenance (oil, tires, brakes, etc)

Fully worth that to me

Because otherwise I’d pay a percentage of that in taxesI ask myself the same thing every day haha2.19 isn’t good?Wheel caps gains. I like unlimited loss/profit potentialAll gains.

So I short TSLA not because I want to, but because I have to.I used firm tofu, use a cheesecloth or some paper towels to squeeze as much of the water out in the sink, put the tofu block in the pan and chop it up with your spatula until it looks like scrambled eggs, add some nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, garlic powder, keep mixing over medium high heat until the sizzle of the remaining water quiets down. Pair with a tortilla or some plant-based sausage.Thank you broGuilty of selling all of my PLUG on 30%.

7.5c was opened on 12/30 with the anticipation of an ER run. Pussed out and sold half of em last week so I could play around with house money.

Might consider exercising if I can pull enough cash from the OTM calls. 9c is looking good, but the 10c and 11c need a solid pump.Agreed. I'm thinking of closing AMD for something that has the potential for 6-24mo explosion like cannabis or sustainable energy.I have 5 $21s expiring Friday and honestly don't know what to do either.

But looking at technical chart for PLUG,   extremely overbought,  so It will drop 10% from today's closed, which was $66,  to $60.i'm planning on seeing how it opens.

These big companies have so much bloat.Oh I misunderstoodIf it moves anything like TAN 35% is conservativeIt is, that's why shares are likely a better position. If it goes up 35% you get that. With the option, you'll need it to go up like 40% to get 35%.

Even the slightest search would've given you a wealth of information on what they're doing.

Canoo engineered/designed an EV platform that underpins two of the four models they've shown off. Hyundai was so impressed with it, they contracted them to engineer Hyundai's EV platform, who is also in talks with Apple for the Apple car. They've built 13 driving prototypes, and performed over 50 crash tests in less than 19 months (which would take a legacy auto manufacturer 3-5 years and over $1B) to do. Fisker, Lordstown and etc have done neither.

Jay Leno visited them earlier this summer. Yes, the vehicle drives under it's own power and Leno even drove it.

At $33K, the Canoo MPDV released last month is the cheapest cargo van in the market, period. It's cheaper than either ICEV or EV. It's 1/2 to 2/3 the price of the next cheapest EV van. Since it shares the same skateboard between all models, all R&D costs can spread across all models, and it can quickly and cheaply pivot to different cabins as the market requires.

Hopefully they keep going up- I myself don’t one any of them, so idk why I’m getting trolled; however, I have recommended them to some tradersPffftt ok. Carry onwards saltineGotta link politics to the market. Throw a SPY $500 in there somewhere.True. Thank youRodger that friendo I'll buy calls 2 weeks out give myself a buffer.Oh cool thanks man I’ll try that nowdid not know this I have .77cents in thinkorswim on some weed stock 6 yrs ago that tanked so I'm good 

So its `setup > application settings > system > quote speed `

then select `real-time (no delay)` thats the step?Lol nice tryNo problem! Good luckthnx, this was very helpfulOuch...I did the math tonight. Ive been playing options but to achieve the same result with shares I would have had to buy 2,000 at $5 (I tell boomers that’s my average)Yeah I never really liked the comparison to 1999 except for the euphoria part, this time around feels a lot more dystopian to me for some reason.  1999 seems like the definition of froth to me, this time around seems like the erratic pulse of a dying patient spiking up and down before it finally succumbs to... something.Ah looks like it’s called “margin maintenance” in RH under the “investing” options tab. For me it’s 20% below my baselineYeah I think it will, it’s been stuck here at this level for a bit bound to pump soonIs it? Doesn't seem like anything could bring this market down especially as the dollar continues it's journey down to 0.I don’t expect it to hit 35 but deep OTM usually have higher returns. I got them on dec 28 when the blood bath started lmfaoNah ima move it to tesla 1000c expire in April lolOh I can be assigned? Like I don’t have that kinda cash to buy 100 shares of Tesla. Guess that’s why I’m asking haha. I thought the most you could lose on a spread is collateral?How’s business busy?

I have a 1/21/22 $30cYou usually get them at community colleges, 2 year schools where you can get your associates and then transfer to a 4 year uni to complete your bachelorsSPY has a direct correlation bruh. 

But really though, I’ve been taking this serious the whole time. Just pisses me off that this shit keeps rallying when it’s a fucking disaster out there.

Shit if my comment hurt you, idk what to tell you. Usually when I post the covid cases and deaths people comment “bullish” or “no one cares”Over time quality picks do, unless you’re a penny stock chaser or the world ends...Some do, some have rates way below typical investing returns, his hard stance on debt is purposely ignorant to please the addicts who are seeing the light of Dave RamseyAlso forgot to mention his complete hardline against credit cards, credit cards used responsibly are no riskI’m stoked people are taking steps to be responsible, if you’ve ever checked the YouTube comments you know people are fanatic about him, that only listen to him, and that bums me out, heard him tell people multiple times to cut fat checks (40-80 thousand) to pay debt where he didn’t even ask the interest. His advice is lazyMy unborn children would love meTyI agree...just keeping people honest. Because I know 99% of people cheering the Trump ban were also flaming with rage over the cake thing.I am a revolutionary, I want to smash the system with the assistance of these megacorps. Oh god no don't go near the capitol that's sacred!!!!I think you replied to the wrong guy.You’re right. Respectable. My bad broDuck it, I'm inK, was talking about cciv.Not bad at all 👏Problem is...it's just about their only consistent way to make money.

Diving into PLUG deeper...this is a real fucking shit stain of a company good lord lolI was not making an analogy. 

One can imply that the guy doesn't like the jewish. I was, in part, agreeing and stated why I was not fond of them.

I went on to challenge him by asking how a company is expected to go public if they can't IPO, and that it is ridiculous to consider it a jewish plot. It legit makes no sense.yeahhhhh I quit for a while and started again when I was working 12 hr days for the electionRight. She doesn’t sell down to exactly 10% because then if it goes up the next day she has too much👍TSLA is over bought and you know it, once the big boys dumb after they realize they don’t make a profit you’ll get fucked too!that’s why they’re called retards 👍when’s the video going up so 5 people can watch it?4 trill stimmy? u pulling shit out ya ass now boy, wait till you see what’s really gonna go down 🤠Selling them?Nice broThat's impressive, so far only managed to make $1k into $2k and scared to lose it hahaSeems short term options in general aren't cutting it these daysUgh great career and about to be a dadfind something that doesn't have the market cap of an afghani camel laundererthere are a few times it's spiked before, and it sank after

hmmOh so apple did infact say they were buying them or did everyone read that pressed wrong?Im in canada too and i think ive ordered like 5 things on amazon during thr pandemic (mostly pc stuff, which i could easily get from canada computers). I was on parler and most the people on there closed their amazon accounts and are massively pissed of at it. I think its quite easy to get rid of amazon, facebook is a lot harder to boycott imo. Il look for some metrics see what consumer stickiness amazon has. I could be wrong. Anyways il prolly throw a 1000 or two in some puts after i look into it a bit more.K. good luckThanks for the reply. I’m quite naive, and conventionally believed holding calls through ER was not a good idea yet I’m a complete novice. I’ll have a deeper dive, cheers.Cool. You know there is another side to that cycle and people can't be chasing forever, right?It is for 🐻🌈Haha I have the same high edge software telling yielding the same answer66k when it hits 1000? Damn maybe I'll just leave it to get more in the money hahaCheck out the spread at open tomorrowrofl ripYou're right. I think Europeans are actually taxed similarly to Americans and our healthcare costs are outrageous. 

We spend all our money on fireworks.Keep going daddy, my wife’s about to cum.I’ll 💎🙌 you broooooHoly shit is right broOh yeah, I agree 100%Why do you think politicians consistently out perform large funds and the market?Simping for Pelosi, LMAOiShares Global Clean Energy ETFStock goes up $5. $1.50 contract goes up $0.65. That’s a nice % gain. Multiply by the # of contracts I have. Not bad for a days “work”So make no profit for 3 months? That's old school thinking: have to call a broker and look at the news each night. Everybody can have any app now that gets real time updates, order book info, etc. I lost 10k in options first half of 2020 cuz I didn't know anything. Took that knowledge to trading shares only. 13k>20k October to today. Fuck holding long term. Momentum trading all the way[deleted]LikewiseWhat do you think about holding this vs FCEL? Was wanting to have 100 shares of that after exercising a call but idk nowProgressive brother progressive. And what better way to progress than buy FDs  aka the WSB way. 

Also looking at WSB being retarded is a gift not a shortcoming.Working at a “hedge fund” for free during college was the best decision of my life. Highly recommend.Ok boomerrip to my cold brotherAnnual percentage rate. No interest for a few years. Just go to the dealership and find the car you want. If they can’t get you below 1 percent start getting up and walking out the door. If they let you walk out over 1 percent they’re assholes. It’s an almost 60k car. I’d be foaming at the mouth if I was the salesperson talking to youAnd don’t tell them that you’re financing for fun lol. Always try to work out a deal. Dealerships will almost always come down on a brand new car. Less likely on a used one but shoot your shot anyways. Good luck!For sure.  Tough to be living fat on the coasts in general.  Bay Area is such a dump.  Wasn't impressed either with gigs I did out there.  At least to vacation SoCal is about 100x better imo.Thx u 4 ur cervix brøtherHaha yeah, and in fairness, I'm sure most Dems weren't looking that hard either.Ah yea that’s pretty fishy🍻here’s to hope, cuz I would love to totally ~~not~~ diversify into fintechIt didn’t price via Fidelity. It doesn’t necessarily mean they didn’t complete the offering via a traditional investment bank to institutional and private banking customers, which is why Fidelity didn’t get any allocation.I usually try to keep it around 50% options/50% (safe) stocks, and if the options rip I try to adjust it back.

After today, I’m like 90/10. Hoping it rips until about 11am tomorrow, then I’ll sell a big chunk.Of course! It’s one the essential staple animes!It’s nice knowing it’s there honestly. I’m play FCEL to lag follow PLUG. I’m doing well since opening that position in shares. The clean energy sector is going to be hot with plenty of eyes. There will be plenty of plays.Sunworks, similar chart to PLUG when PLUG was @ $15 and it’s been running. I’m only 20 shares deep but i’m buying more todayAlways man. I almost always sell half first regardlessDude, you are missing the point. It's not about the company. Is about CCP control over international trade if their stock.15A is rotary wing pilot? What’s 37ANei uf Swissquote. Corner besser?Bi aber kein klassische daytraderEh, yeah I mean. He was obnoxious and a shit talker for sure, but didn’t incite any violence. His staff would’ve no-go’d that the second he would’ve try. I do agree with protecting the tendies though. Would like to enjoy a life where the choices of the people in power don’t effect me as much as they do the poor’sJust using your logic. If trump organized violence, arrest him. But he didn’t. 

The other group on the other hand, welp. We know how that went. 

Luckily dems won so no more BLM. Racism extinct🖐Be rich over being right, just ride the wave and enjoy the tendies.Well yeah oil and gas will never be the same but the banks will be fineIronicOk maybe I need to read more about it. I like gas.I’ve stared at the chart too long today, have to buy it now.   Is back to pre covid level with earnings around the corner

Edit: a little more squeeze leftWell it's banned here sadly. I bought it after the offering but got exercised :( had to rebuy higherYeah, companies don’t want to train. Still, get the right keywords. Don’t have to be an expert, just know few things. Any exposure to AWS or Spark?Try working on some Kaggle competitions to gain experience.The banks don't want to get fooked if you can't pay for a repair, it adds up I guesshulu has all themCathie is still scooping shares, so there’s definitely still a chance. ARCT followed pretty similar price action today. Hopefully tomorrow it’s gonna be back the the regularly scheduled 🚀🤡Good luck friendWait message me haha I really don’t knowOTM you never expected to hit with 90% of your portfolio in calls on a stock that has NDA's out the ass & has no catalysts until 2 weeks before expiry. GotchaMight want to do some more research before making plays like this. If the stock price is in the money for the short leg (your sell) and out of the money for your long leg (your buy) at the time of expiry and you haven’t closed your position then you will be on the hook to buy 100 shares at the strike of the put you sold and the outer strike will expire worthless. This will probably put your account deep in the negative for a day or two because RH will automatically assign you those shares and you have to sell them at whatever price it opens the next trading day. Also there is risk that someone exercises the sell contract early for whatever reason and again you will be on the hook for those shares but that is unlikely to happen. But it certainly can and does happenYeah bro if ur asking in here...you’re prolly good to go and just do it.Even better kingYeah I find it annoying that we keep rallying during all this as well. Kind of unreal how little of a fuck people giveThat’s the point. Addicts. They can’t use it responsibly. You wouldn’t offer an alcoholic a taste of your drink.Yeah I would agree that’s ineffective but you have to realize a lot of his target audience are so beyond irresponsible that that’s the only way to motivate them. When you’re dealing with someone with tens of thousands of CC debt, expensive car payment, etc it’s going to be hard to explain to them “well, theoretically the market should outperform your interest rate on this particular debt so invest that instead” rather than just telling them to get their shit together and start paying it off. I know what you’re saying thoughWow you’re a badassGMNow I get to quit my crying :’)

Yeah bro, you got calls huhWell, hopefully they use that money on hookers and blow for company partiesI don’t see the comment ab jews that you’re talking ab. I must have whoever it is blocked lolStress is always a big trigger. Couple big advantages of the nicotine pouches is you don’t have to take smoke breaks at work and don’t smell like an ashtray all the timeShe is selling on days when Tesla is more than 850. Doesn't look like she is buying back. Let's see how this week goesTSLA will tie into all of musks ventures ontop of EV dominance, there’s more going on behind the rally than meets the eye..If he made money during the crash I'm assuming he bought themThat’s what I mean tho, I only started with 90 so I said fuck it to everything I did and it just worked out, if I started with 1k like you I could have made a shit ton but I probably would have been terrified to invest as much as well.Pony up the cash for ITM calls on a good company a few months out on a dip/correction. Be patient. Then profit.They must be making decent money or they would blowing themselves up ya knowUp 120% on the week o.oThat’s why I’m telling you to do spreads. The only way to make money with options is to get really lucky or learn to trade spreads.After looking it on my crap software, this doesn't look like a double top.

You may say a small pull back though. This is fairly bullishHey when tendies are printing, you may as well light some rockets🚀🚀🚀Because they have inside information. But there’s nothing sketchy about that purchase. She bought PayPal on the cheap after the market droppedAnd if you look at PayPal’s chart she actually bought pretty lateNo you’re just wrongIf you want to call someone out for illegal trades call out David PerdueOh wtf lol that sounds boring ._.You act like people have only enough cash for one positionThis isn’t the sub for you, this will just add to the craziness. You’re not even diversified with your only position in AMD. Check out the r/financialindependence sub for ways other people are retiring early and/or living happier more fulfilling lives. Good luck brother, keep your head up. Only one life to live.Click the “exercise” button on RobinHood, or sell the call and use the money to buy the sharestahts true i like this placdeThen hook me up bro. I wanna make bank.Joke went over your head. Go back to McDonald’s.Send helpI know what APR is, just didn’t know they did 0%. Crazy! Definitely gonna ask the dealership.Bay Area is a complete dump, yeah. Just soul crushing. Not sure what kind of gigs you mean, but if it’s music, I agree that the scene sucks as well. SoCal was where I initially wanted to land but work was up here 🤷‍♂️ Now I’m headed for the country 🛻😎HooahThey are insider trading prolly too lmaoI’ve done several IPOs through fidelity, this is the first time I’ve seen this message. I’ve gotten plenty of “sorry you didn’t get an allocation” messages, but I was under the impression that not pricing tonight was for everyone. I don’t think it’s priced by individual investment firm.Thanks
For the word pimp! Will check outOk sell nio that I’m up almost 500 percent on, got itYeah, I’m a Blackhawk pilot. 37 is PSYOP. have a selection date next monthmh isch mir sympathischer wills in prozent berächnet wird und Nyse isch chli günstiger aber müesst Swissquote no gnauer aluegeShit talking to people who are already angry hateful and racist carrying heavy weapons in paramilitary uniforms is equivalent to inciting violence. This is how people get mobbed and killed everyday on the streets. he doesn’t need to tell them to do anything, it is understood.Save you stream of consciousness bullshit for 4chanBut to be rich you usually have to be right about things, or so they tell meYou sold meDon't do it dude it's just an Uber without all the other capital investments...i just don't see it. But then again it's your moneyReally? Wtf. And damn :/ I do covered strangled on it quite a bitNo :(🤡 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡U don’t need it to hit the strike to make profit. In fact, Long dated OTM calls have the highest returns since theta decay won’t be high. In retrospect, it’s easier to think this way. But back in dec 28, it consolidated in that range for more than a month, market was expecting a Santa rally & had the perfect wedge like setup to blast off. There was no real catalyst for it go down in the last 3 weeks too so 🤷‍♂️

Edit: I don’t expect it to hit 35 now but back when it was in the 27-29 range in dec, was expecting 40 actually. The ROI would have been insane with 35c considering the intrinsic value they would have, the amounts of contracts I could buy leading to higher delta change & IV Spike at these levelsYeah so I guess I shouldn’t touch tesla Put credit spreads with only a 5k account? I just thought I’d they expired worthless I’d get max gain and if they expired ITM or didn’t go my way I would lose my collateralNice, let’s get that bread.Cool cool cool feeing a lot of heat for my remarks lol.

I mean that justification is the same as Fauci assuming Americans were to stupid to not buy all the masks, I always vote lead with truthyou're a useful idiot for tech billionairesEquity, can't buy calls on cciv bruhOh, I seeNot buying back is bullish because it means she thinks it will go up to ten percent again

I’m in NIO right now instead but just sayingReally wish I stared during the covid crash. Only 3-4 meme stocks nowadays🤡I’ve been playing with some spreads but no precise strategies per-se (Condor etc). With those recommended spreads do you have a % margin you would sell?Haha, this is a partisan issue for you, isn’t it? You honestly believe your chosen side is better somehow? Dude, they’re all shit. They don’t care about you. Fuck Pelosi and Fuck Perdue. Stop SimpingSure is but democratic admin coming in. Buyden’s already outlined a plan that will focus more on renewable energy. Shit is going to printLMAO I mean, I'm always tied up in something. Rarely manage to sit cash more than a day. Never have more then 20% in one positionI know how to, was wondering if you’d rather hold FCEL or Sun/wI laughed if it makes you feel betterWhatever you sayNah semiconductor work gigs.  Music scene maybe something it has going for it.  Don't know as didn't catch a lot of music while was there.Yup. Dems and Reps have more in common with each other then they do with us normal folkHow would it start trading tomorrow if the offering didn’t go through?Good luck buddy. Went to ranger school with a psyops dude, good fucking dude. Wonder how that’s gonna be with the captain that is under investigation for the riots in DC. I’m shooting for 18A with selection date in Aug. Godspeed.Well, it’s not the equivalent(legally speaking). He did not call for people to be violent. The legal consequences should fall on those who chose to bring weapons to the capitol, not the president. 

That’s why we have the law in the first place. If I go shoot someone because I thought you did something bad to me, it isn’t your fault. Even if you did do something really bad, you still didn’t shoot that person. Therefore, you shouldn’t be held accountable.

Edit: changed “bring armed weapons” to bring weaponsBe happy that trump is out, my man. Likely no more republicans are going to be in office after this. So there’s 4+ years of peace and harmony for you. Lighten upNot really? All those right people thought TSLA was overvalued last year are not rich yet.I don’t even have the appWhat about OXYNo biggie. Most shops have dedicated teams who handle AWS and Spark. These things tend to be large and complex. 

Just read up on Spark, what it is and why it’s important. 

As to AWS, look up Lightsail. This will get you a small Linux instance on AWS. Just get it up and running, put Python on it and run some simple script. It should run you $5 a month. 

You can then say, I am familiar with AWS, Linux...experience: mid level. 

That’s your stack. YouTube is your friend and build up your skill set. Lightsail will at least give you hands on experience - better than nothing. You don’t have to be an expert but present a good list of skills and willingness to learn, especially if you list Linux and how you stood up an instance.You mean besides algos & big firms pinning it between 23 & 26 to shake out the paper handed WSB FD retards until said catalysts?This is the same logic with put credit spreads for any stock. So I would recommend less volatile stocks that won’t have 10% swings or sell/buy very deep OTM puts for the strategy. You will get way less premium but it gives you more peace of mindYou know itI don’t have a Twitter or anything like that but we both know what happens when you assumeDuh. I’m dumb. Good shit thoLol what’s the username im curiousGood retarded tesla logicYeah, during the covid crash I was like...damn, everything must go up and it did😂I make small plays and hold them until close to expiration.Dude, it's not even worth it. Can't argue with someone who is so biasedShe is objectively not the most corrupt politician in power right now lol. It’s not even closeSo what companies are part of it? Shit mooned already kindaIt doesn’t.Basically everything here kind of sucks. Great weather and weed though 👍Did you Read the message?

PI is required by the SEC to obtain confirmations on indications of interest after effectiveness but before secondary market trading in Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO begins.  The Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering is NOW expected to be declared effective tomorrow morning, 01/13/2021 and trading in the secondary market will begin immediately afterwards.  As a result, there would be insufficient amount of time for PI to obtain customer confirmations and complete the allocation process prior to the security's trading in the secondary market.  Therefore, PI has withdrawn from the Affirm Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock IPO offering.You too man, maybe I’ll catch you at Bragg this fallUnderstood. The law is the law. However mob justice doesn’t work like that. A similar case was debated in the courts before that’s why this is not technically a crime.  Kkk member got together and lynched people in the past, in the court it was argued the guy who pointed the finger was not responsible because he was not involved in the lynching. You draw a line where you want but when something as critical as this happens everyone remotely involved and looked the other way should be charged. People don’t understand how quickly everything can go to shit.I’m saying they have to go together not that you can’t be right and poor you tardI'm not talking about the app, I'm talking about the company. Uber has: ubereats, postmates, uber etc.

Lyft has...lyftPersonally i don't invest in crude resources so not rare earth metals/steel/oil.ok I'll check it out thanks broHonestly I don’t think the catalysts will matter much atm if it doesn’t plan to move since we have shit ton open interest on Jan & feb calls esp 30c. If the market has some sort of correction in the next two weeks, that would make things worse and will go sideways in the best case scenario. I do expect it to be 40+ end of febAlso I won’t be surprised if we hit the resistance at around 27.6 wed or thurs, fail to successfully break it and come back to 23-24 range. Will be massively fucked at this range.

But if we do break it, 30+ coming v soon<3, LRHR. (low risk high reward) bbMandemDontHearMeThoOnly plays I'm making now are NIO (already cashed out) and ICLNWho said she was the most corrupt politician? Aight, sounds like your fighting straw men that aren’t here. Looks like you got this on your own. Peace ✌🏻https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239738/ishares-global-clean-energy-etf


Plug and ENPH are top two. You also get some exposure to REGI which has done fucking incredible this year. Lots more too that I haven’t researchedYeah take hippie politicians over bat shit crazy ones have here so always positives and negatives.Yeah I read it. I’m not sure why you keep asking that. So PI pulled out because they didn’t get it priced in time to be part of the offering. It doesn’t mean it wasn’t priced with another bank. It specifically says it starts trading tomorrow.I’ll know who you are by your WSB lisence plate.Yeah I agree with that. I don’t agree with quite a few specifics of the law in these situations. But it’s all we got. Without a stern line then laws are useless, which it’s gotten so blurred in the last few years anyways. So yea it’s a mess“Right” here means TSLA will burst 1 day

You can make money now being wrong currently and still be right somedayAnd Tesla doesn’t even use gasAlright, RDFNGood luck.Oh yeah lol f that cornball he never has anything of value to add to the sub he stays on his bs I bet he doesn’t even have positionsKinda dumb he can still interact w my posts even tho I got him blocked lolYeah I did NIO as well and sold, now I’m holding PLUG I bought at 61!
