1) Q4 ER is starting and banks will set the mood going into Q4 earnings in general. With low interest and the market run-up, it's expected that they're performing well. It's really if they can blow past expectations at this point and what management's guidance is. Just meeting expectation won't justify their company's valuation;

2) Biden doesn't seem like he'll have a honeymoon period with how polarized Congress is. While he wants to get a larger stimulus package out there, it depends on senators like Manchin, Murkowski, and Collins, who are as moderate as you can get;

3) Dec economic report wasn't that great. Manufacturing is expanding but the economy is pushing out both temp and long-term jobs. Important to note, however, that manufacturing is a leading economic indicator while payroll is a current indicator; and

4) Santa rally typically lasts a week after NYE, so starting this week, it's over. There could be a rotation or profit-taking this week.The next 4 / 8 years will be the greenest fucking years in the history of green. It'll be so green they'll literally have to re-define the color greenBuy anything 30 mins after market openNext time I’d rather just get born richCan't wait to autistically look at futures all nightʕ•ᴥ•ʔ r fukcan't freaking believe it.

What do I doNice another green week for Tesla 1000$ EOWThis is just spitballing so tell me what you think, but the user flair space is a pretty good spot to convey information which works cross-platform. What if we created a system that gave you, at a glance, 2-3 pieces of information about a WSB user?

Say, a 'WSB age' field, a comment activity field, and a submission activity field

Maybe something like Noob, 1-3 weeks, 1-6 months, 1-x years for the WSB age, then one of three emojis (ice, normal, fire) for activity.

So your user flair would be "3 Years 🔥 🔥" or something like that if you're both an active submitter and commenter. 

This would probably completely overwrite our current flairs or maybe allow extra text on the side. idk. Just an idea as to how we might address putting more eyes on the post history of people bringing information to our community.

**EDIT:** It seems like the most common dissenting response is "Yeah that's ok but I like my flair. Would a combination of still having unique flairs and the wsb stats be a good solution or do you not like it either way?My move tomorrow is to “invest” large sums of moneyAnyone know any pornstars that look like Nancy Pelosi?

Joe Biden, with the help of a Democrat-controlled House + Senate, will pump $2.4 trillion into the sector during 2021. My prediction is that sometime in the next 5 years, **ICLN** will cost $300+ per share (maybe more). Getting it now, even after a week surge, is still an absolute steal. Get in now before the real pump happens. This is once in a lifetime opportunity, we haven't seen an infrastructure change like this since the industrial revolution. The dam has broken, and smart money, even oil companies such as Shell and BP, have already started pouring funds into the clean energy sector.

The energy sector is about to turn upside down and clean energy will be the only way to power anything by 2035.

&#x200B;

**ICLN** GANG RISE UPDon’t cheat on your wife.

Words of wisdom.These doom and gloom posts won’t age well by tmrwMan... remember the days back in like March when we’d watch futures together and they’d hit 5% up or down within a few hours? Those were the days.Anyone else get a bit scared when you see similarities between the dot-com bubble and the currently proclaimed "EV-Bubble"? Everyone seem to be buying EV-stocks and they pop up everywhere. It doesn't matter which EV-stock you buy, it will go up. Same as how people in the 90's just put money into internet companies because it "couldn't go wrong".

It's all about which companies will win the EV-race in the end, and there isn't room enough for all of them..Stocks will be either up or down tomorrowHERE COME THE BEARS SLITHERING OUT THE WOODWORK LIKE THE SNAKES THEY ARE\*markets down .4%\*

The most impressive features are the intensity and enthusiasm of bulls, the breadth of coverage of stocks and the market, and, above all, the rising hostility toward bears. In 1929, to be a bear was to risk physical attack and guarantee character assassination. For us, 1999 was the only experience we have had of clients reacting as if we were deliberately and maliciously depriving them of gains. In comparison, 2008 was nothing. But in the last few months the hostile tone has been rapidly ratcheting up. The irony for bears though is that it’s exactly what we want to hear. It’s a classic precursor of the ultimate break; together with stocks rising, not for their fundamentals, but simply because they are rising."say what you will, watching buttcorn price action is entertaining AFTo everyone shilling Boeing puts.

That balance is Nio and Apple car gaining traction. 

So. At open I’m gonna wait for the biggest, fattest, green Tesla spike and buy puts for March. Somewhere in the range of 650. I’ll have to look at the prices. ($3050 with 87% volatility. Fucking gross.)I am strongly considering joining GME gang tomorrow. I’ve watched from the sidelines and resisted for too long now.Watched those Trumptards kill that cop with an American flag.

Change my mind

Edit: the fact that the only response you all can make is "it only goes up" and "buy puts" should make you all concernedBABA $260 by eowFor those playing PSTH, I’ve been in for a few months now and there’s a pretty predictable trend;

PSTH should dip some tomorrow. That’s when I’ll be accumulating some more (probably more feb/June calls) . Small bump at market open then drift down to 28-29(maybe 27 but I doubt it). It’ll reverse sometime late next week and end with slightly higher highs next Friday at market close. 

Obviously, if there is an announcement this all goes out the window. ✌🏻Social security is an MLM change my mindThink I’m gonna turn $1250 into $4000 tomorrow :)New price target for nio from BOAWith all this PSTH shilling I'll certainly sell tomorrow.Snow in Austin caused a blackout.

For example on Friday I sold my puts I had bought earlier in the day when SPY hit a major trend line on its mid day drop. It later went under that trend line and I jumped in on more puts because there was a chance we could drop a while until we reached the next support.

$GOEV will present at CES 2021 alongside many other new EV brands this week!
They will introduce their new consumer-model which might be groundbreaking (it's fairly new, cant say if it will catch on but they want to rent the cars without a contract with a single monthly fee that includes everything from charging to insurance).

Additionally, $GOEV is rumored to be the skateboard used for the Apple Car (via Hyundai's & Canoo's partnership).Pigs getting slaughtered Monday, and no doubt that includes the majority of those posting here on WSB.

Resident JPM intern downvote once to confirmAre 1/15s still considered leapsSector rotation to Nasdaq 🤪Nerds who hate section 230 talk look away now

Section 230 likely won’t be repealed because it would be useless. Repealing would have such a chilling effect on free speech if social media is held to The NY Times rule that almost every scholar agrees that the Supreme Court would analogize social media to bookstores instead of newspapers which would in effect give the same protection as 230.

The biggest issue right now is what happens to Amazon AWS etc. that is arguably infrastructure, and when infrastructure starts acting too discriminatory the court might step in.

CHALLENGE UPDATE:

I took a very big risk trading QS, and have been getting hammered hard by it recently. However, things are not as bad as they appear, when you consider the insane amount of premium I am collecting...

My true cost basis is $65 - $5.50 premium = $59.5 / share. After selling a single weekly covered call, that cost basis will drop to around $54 / share. Each additional weekly CC will continue to drop the cost basis over time. Which means **even with the stock I own being down 20% from my entry, I would still end up with a profit.** That is the power of selling extremely high IV options.

Only if QS tanks well below $50, and stays there for months on end, do I risk an actual loss on this trade. I just hope that doesn't happen...

All they have left is downvoting the evil commie comments on reddit 😔Holy shit apple!First, flair me

Most of you are too young to know you had to be the first 3 commenters on the weekend thread to get a flair. Fastest fingers wonIve been trying to gain a better understanding of the bond market and its relation and implications to other markets. 

I understand that when yields fall this is an indicator and effect of investors higher demand for bonds and as a result bond prices rise. Generally investors are piling into bonds as a safe haven asset and money  flows from riskier asset classes like equities to bonds?

So if this is true then the falling yields during corona, should mean that money has been flowing into bonds, correct? 

I have a hard time understanding this with the background of the general sentiment that during corona investors apparantly have been piling into equities FROM bonds due to falling interest rates and yields in bonds? Thus explaining the huge rally in equities. 

The only explanation I see is that money has been flowing into BOTH equities and bonds during corona, because of falling yields and a huge rally in equities? Where am I going wrong?

Edit: I knew you were all retards already but couldnt think of another place to ask at this point in time.Holy fuk these futures. What's a good stock for the apocalypse?Okay i am trying tk help out my gf is there any weekly call that will return like 15% guaranteed next week she only has like $200 in her accountMake tomorrow red and the rest of the week green so I can take huge gains from selling puts and moving them into sharesYou don’t have to fuck with country music but Jason Aldean and Morgan Wallen are people you need to buy calls on[deleted]I want to buy this dip.. but what if it dips lower$BABA fucked tomorrow?I know Ken Kriffin the CEO of citadel.

The Twitter logo is BLUEIDK, the Dems were the first to go after tech this way in 2016. Silicon valley might just be playing nice with the new leadership but backlash over this might push some vulnerable Dems into action across party lines. The Senate is still pretty close.

Either way I wouldn't rule it out and keep an eye on the headlines.Humor me for a second, maybe the Dems do policy based on public need and not vendettas.Yeah baby print itttttt

Edit: I don't actually believe this but if some fucking time traveller told me that we hit 1600 by the first week of February, I wouldn't be surprised; these TSLA bulls are getting so eager and the FOMO is too real with Papa Musk becoming the richest in the world.I’m full tilt on TSLA shorts & hedged with some ARK Calls has been working well.

ModsChildren hospitalMeWhat price would be green?Is NAMBLA a charityPeople love their flairs. I don’t like the ban info either. Like why do users need to know thatI just ate so much buttThis is stupid.  Lots of long time active posters are full of shit and people who never post and just lurk can provide pretty valuable DD. Like if somebody is mostly lurking on here and then they take the time to post something then it is likely to be more thought out than whatever the average WSB dummy shits out his frito-hole.  If anybody is stupid enough to fuck their life up by blowing money based on what somebody posts on the internet then you were gonna fuck your life up by getting scammed one way or another anyway.Why can’t you just sticky a comment on posts from people who have no WSB history?Once the user is called out in the comments for their lack of activity/age of their account, I think our hivemind is strong enough to shoo them away, or at least bring attention to the fact that they're "sus"People earned their flair, and I think they won't want to lose it. Mods are gay btw.Don’t get rid of my flair!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥Feels basic for this sub. Can I also please get a change in my flair to “Patron Saint of Anal” or somMaybe - but I like my current flair I earned from votebot

I also like the ban flairs to mark the degensI like my flair. Has a subtle touch to it.I’m a 3yr commenter and DD poster of ICLN in November can I get some new flairpleas include penis size tooSounds like a good idea just make it super short like 5 characters. Just don't fuck up former flairsAnything for a flair daddyLoses the uniqueness of it

Plus people make alts that they use so age might not be as fun as flairs given

Edit: Ban numbered flairs are kinda pointless imo as it just crowds the good flairsCan we just use dick ascii? The longer the dick the more trustworthyNah man, stay true to WSB. Don’t go vanilla.

People love their flair.Separating new people from veterans at a glance would be nice.I’ve been here over a year and still dumb as hell. No one should listen to me.I dig it. Better than the ban flair at the moment.Any flair at all would be nice...I think the combination of unique flairs and those with WSB age/activity would be coolLet's do it. I don't post anything because I don't know how to make funny videos so I just talk shit. Have only flair to gain.I think its a great idea so we can more easily identify the gay noobsI’d rather have a funny phraseI fuck with this.thats a fire ass ideaI think that only activity should be considered with flairs, nothing elseYes both would be perfect thank youI would like a warning like only has ghey shares, or gme retard ectAny way for the user to pick 🌈🐻🐂?

Like the idea thoughYesSounds goodI’m down.I love it - gives a weighted believability. 

Kinda sad though to think that the “local virgin” flair guy would lose his. It sort of is the perfect flair for him tbh.Just flag PLTR holdersIf it gets this damn prison tattoo I got for mentioning something between a boat and a raft I’d like that.I like it1. imo a flair like "ball licker" conveys a lot more information on a person's comment history than how long they've been commenting. 
2. I think flaring users based off post age has the potential to create a bias where old DD is pumped and new DD is in the shadows never to be seen. 
3. For a sub that dicks on boomers all day, I think the last thing we should do is recreate their mentality in possibly shunning new ideasBetter pin biden tweet to fuk bears.I’m inGayWorth a test run maybeI'd say try and keep unique flair too but it's a great ideaLike it. Do the account age.  The other thing with I've and fire... maybe.I fuck with itWhat if people hide their flair?I like this idea, but I also like earned flair for stupid shit too.  Why not both?I like the account age and the activity levelFlair me daddyGreat ideaAll I wanted for Christmas was WSB flair. To answer your question this is meh. It's kind of a cool idea but the flair here is such a badge of honor, I'd say keep it unique.🐂 and 🐻 flair plsThis sounds cool, how does age work if I quit and re-joined at one point? I’m gonna look like a noob :(. Thanks for always working to make this place better zjAs someone who cycles through reddit accounts every couple of months, I don't really like the idea.Just the stats. Or...if someone has been here say 3 years or more, let them pick their own (within reason).sounds goodThere's a healthy chunk of those who are very active in the daily discussion but don't submit much, and those are further split between the pure shitposters and the play discussers. That system wouldn't be able to differentiate between those who are dishing out plays and those dishing out shitposts.Reminds me of when r/bodybuilding did a similar thing giving flair rating people’s physiques if they sent in photos.

It ended because it turns out some of the mods were passing around the photos and making fun of people.

I feel like this would be an even more autistic version of that, we should do it.- too much info crammed into a tight space

- if necessary, the info (such as account age) can be gained in other ways; no need to duplicate

- it's irrelevant most of the time because people can post their positions to establish their credibility

- flairs for activity incentivizes quantity. could end up having users polluting more to get flairs

- better the way it isI like this, plus what you put in the edit.I don't think I would like this. Getting a unique wsb flair is one of my goals. Plus if we cared about a poster, we can just check their profile.Current flair system already displays notoriety. A flair system like you suggested, in my opinion would dilute the current flair system and also, unintentionally create a hierarchy which would not benefit the flow of WSB.

I vote against.We need gain loss verified on flairI’ve been here like 4 years and never gotten flair, mostly a lurker but I’m a retard that bough tilray shares at the top after its initial run up, I’ve earned my place in the community.I told my mommy when  I got this flair so you better not take it away. I'd be fine with combined flair with time spend in this gambling den.No ones that hotDo you even remember Battery day bro?I like your big dick energyIt’s almost certain now, with motley stimulus headline, PT bumps, NIO hyping up EV, good stimulus talks, and blue presidency.

Look at what these companies are doing and realize how terrifying it is they wield this power.how about the PGA banning Trumps courses lol. this is bigger than just social media. every industry that can , WILL take a piece of this pie and make good publicity from it. Trump fucked himself when he was at his weakest, there is nothing more to say. nothing will come of it.Remember when bakers were told they didn’t have to bake wedding cakes for gay couples? Social media doesn’t have to host terrorist.They are going to take away our shit posting.after this & what these wackos r still planning for inauguration, u better believe social media is gonna get regulated under full Dem controlMmm and who would push for this regulation?

They’ll just slowly bleed it down to keep retail from jumping ship too fast.Using all my margin to buy shares at openWhere do you find info on what Cathie buys?I was looking at that, there's no way they don't come back up. Probably won't recapture previous price, but I could see mid 90s within a few weekswith average analyst giving it a price of 150.00 probably a good time to get in and hold. How do you know she bought it?And why did it drop?Failed drug + investigation thoughwhere do you see information/news about Cathie buying ?Being reasonable isn’t allowed hereSmart no doubt. But if I had substantial money on the line at this point, I would just set alerts and watch it like a hawk. The crazy price action could trigger a sell when it really isn’t what your trying to do with a traditional stop. Just engage your own stop in your head. Just too much on the line.A lot of brokers have trailing stopsThe bears are down 14-3Or you could just buy PLTR this week and have an easier ride to the top.

Tinder is easy mode, get like 10 to 20 matches a day of 7/10+.If you’re holding for a college fund what differences does a few dollars makeIf you don't believe AAPL will be significantly higher than it is today, by the time your kids are in college, don't buy it at all.This dude next week: “so I lost my kids college fund on an FD. What do”AAPL overvalued, buy ARKK

But on a real note, if you’re DCA you’re fineProbably safe pretty much. It will go up soon before the earnings.Buy leaps on AAPL. As close to a guarantee as you'll get.Go to r/investingYou could average the shares over a period of time say buy 10 this week 10 next week etc etc or just buy all in if you like the priceAverage in retardICLN.

Go see the Doctor!!!It's simple. The CEO simply takes 100% of the revenue.Nope, ur right. CEO gets more comp than the company's entire revenue. 345,000,000 shares unlocked in March. SNOW is cancer in the medium term.It's actually so hilarious that the CEO makes more than the revenue of the entire company ahaha. IIRC it's all stock/options though so it's really just paid for by dilution.

I have no idea why dumb boomers value this company so highly. They are going to get burned so hard and then fuck outta tech stonks until they die and get replaced by someone else.Shit was manipulated up, I got burned on puts for a big loss in December 

I’m buying puts again on SNOW sometime in late Feb, but I’m okay with missing out on the inevitable drop because timing it seems impossibleMade a ton off snow, felt smart, then it took it all back from me.  In a week that stock can make you rich or send you to the poor house>It’s ... Its.

When the market sells off on scary news, that's BULLISH.

When the market sells off on no news at all, that's BEARISH.

Selling off on scary news means the weak hands, the stupid money, are panic selling. Selling off on no news means the big boys have inside info and are getting out before the news becomes public.Atleast till -9 or so, full correctionI really wouldn’t call what’s been happening “no reason”.ImpeachmentBe greedier when others are greedy.But have you seen the big shortEh he's board certified (and kept it up) so that's a physician to me even if not practicing.

There is no reason to screw yourself out of whatever gains you have made when the market turns (and if you're able to buy a hundred stocks of Tesla, buy puts.  Hedge a little.

Unless the amount is absolutely trivial, then it is pretty basedNo matter what anyone says, lamborghinis are obviously very nice. There’s a reason they cost that much, there’s a reason they are the “go to” car of choice when talking about being rich or getting girls attentions. It might not be everyone’s style, but anyone to say they’re ugly are just jealous people trying to make themselves feel better because they know it’s not realistic to ever own one. So psychologically it feels better to think you don’t want one, instead of can’t have one.The nicest cars ever made😩Let’s goo!what happens in 15 mins?Lmao for what?You forgot the 🚀🚀🚀🚀If it hits 30 this week I’ll buy a lamboI'll buy a bar of steel if it does.

Last time he shorted TSLA it went from $600 to $700. Then he deleted his tweets like a bitchEverything crash Even Market Crash so Burry is not wrongRemember how he was wayyy too soon for the big short?Just have to wait two years like when he shorted housingHe said so months ago and it never didAnyone can literally say anything in the stock market, and eventually it will probably happen. To get a good idea of who’s actually good is how consistently they can predict and be right. Being right a lot more than they are wrong. Burry has been announcing TSLA crashing for several months, and it’s still mooning. He got lucky a few times in the past and everyone thinks he’s a god. He’s making a fool of himself with his tweets, many of which he’s caught deleting. If you want to listen to him, go ahead. Personally, I also believe TSLA will crash, and so does many other people. But something weird is going on and it’s only going up, and no one wants to touch it right now. It’s ruined way too many bears. Haven’t you been reading headlines about the amount of money lost due to people shorting TSLA?

Just be careful man...You can be right and still lose money btw.BYE TSLAI'm too drunk to post my positions properly, but I've got 4x  jan 21 2022 400 put contracts since Tesla is a highly overvalued car company.You’re gonna spend 2k to shirt TSLA?Apple homers will still buy itI imagine it will be all smooth and curvy tear drop shaped.

Dump the calls before earnings IMO unless they are way out.I’d say confidently over $1kTSLA was targeted by big auto, oil, and professional shorts.  TSLA kicked all their asses.

Hype when there’s clear good news, which means yes it’s going up.

Or hype just because something became a meme stock and everyone is praying together. This one usually means it’s fucked, usually, not always.I remember seeing Tesla at $112 a share about 4 years ago. I had so much faith in the company even though it weren’t talked about that much, but I was impatient.

Is it bullish for QS that Nio announced a kick-ass solid state battery?

Or is it bearish because QS doesn't plan to have manufacturing scale for a few years, while Nio will supposedly be ready in a year?Hey, you, I’m still counting on this!CCP not.Since when loserAlexa play lonely by AkonMost likely because no one is selling themWe live in a post circuit breaker world.Circuit breakers are like once in a decade moments, we aren’t going to have them every few months...Why?whyporque?Did you not see last weekYou did your part about bought a contract at ask, right?Too many sellerMore than what is now$100-120$125$75WhichYeah go head budATH every week stocks only go up palTsla?👍👍BA puts???Why?No.Damn the amount of people who didn’t get this referencePussyWe're all breaking up with each other.

🤡🤡🤡I am not Chinese and I agwee. Gyna #1! No you’re the first person to think this ever.It's a bit different than pre-corona for sure. One of the reasons is the prospect of inflation coupled with no interest rate hike in sight, causing things to go a bit higher. 

The second reason is a surge in retail investor activity not seen in a very long time thanks to apps like Robinhood and a little thing called 'desperation'. This is a soft padding but with inelastic goods (shares of Tesla for example), small changes in demand impact prices quite a bit hence the erratic nature you are seeing.

For a third reason, and this is the most speculative... I think people were fearful of a big recession before corona. Now that we know something like a pandemic (and maybe even an insurrection) will keep stocks safe, is there really that much risk relative to return?you don't say/\>looks at TSLA's p/e of 1,600

FUNDAMENTALS DON'T MATTER

NEWS DON'T MATTERTrump loses real power in under two weeks, so no one cares what he does as president anymore (look at how little effect his tweets have on the market these days).

His supporters doing moronic things like "Click all the ads! It'll hurt Google and Twitter!" is a bullish signal.Bought twitter shares after they banned the Mango.I think the market favors hilarious shit like the president getting simulatenously banned from all social media. It's the cleanse we all needed after 2020.When lots of things are uncertain, tech simply isn’t. Regardless of political comes and goes, tech is fully integrated into society and it isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Pick almost any tech company (not memes) and zoom out over the last ten to fifteen years. Growth...plain and simple.You think the folks who live in Butterfuck, Oklahoma are the biggest consumers for big tech?Found the bearDon’t take that away from them. It’s all they got.It literally looks like they’re trying to loseNIONo one knows for weeklies, if monthlies, TSLA or ARKG callsNIO putsWe only down .38% simmer downI'd be buying way OTM calls on the New York GiantsChiefsBengalsRavensTitans, Tannehill is underrated, the offense is dominant, fix the defense and we moon!! Buying the dip after today’s lossZM is never a buy.  


TSLA is always a buy. 


And this is coming from an idiot who has only bought 1 share of TSLA ever and sold for a $90 gain in about a week.  
I am always 0.0001% away from FOMOing into Tesla, which means it’s only going to go up.  Until I jump in.I sure hope soTaxes were 35% for 8 years before 2016 and we mooned 300% during that time

Supply-side economics is a fucking joke. What matters and has always mattered to economic growth is monetary velocity.its  never been green recently with the dollar rallying more than .25%TLT has been sliding the past week. If JPow can't even control bonds, literally the one asset class he's allowed to buy, then there's no hope for stonks.Virtue signaling cucksThey believe their hateful bigoted actions are justifiable in stopping their perceived hateful bigoted actions of othersPure soy.Applauded?

Trump is trying to rile his supporters up to overthrow a democratic process with force.who the fuck are youDude welcome back. Don’t say you support free speech or you’ll get sent to downvote jailBan again pleasenobody gives a  shitBan. Jk you didn’t miss shit. It’s the end of the world until it isn’t.Banlol sounds like you must have said something really dumbDude stop bragging so hard about being an engineer damnSlave away for 5-10 years and make some good options moves and FIRE then travel like a nomadDo the things you hate until you don’t have to is how that goes

Not an engineer but currently working in a high income job that I hate but it is what it isYou aren't bragging, you're whiningThere's generally a market crash every 10 years, so work for a decade, quit your job when it crashes and put all your savings into the stock market, you should be a multi millionaire 6 months laterI heard engineers turn gay coz they’re in classes full of dudes that don’t wear deodorant so they get accustomed to the pheromonesSlave away for a couple years and go travelI'm an engineer that's been making six figures for the past 13 years and I hate my life. The best my lifes ever been was when I worked in retail while in college. Sometimes I think about quitting my job and applying to work in retail.I mean you can pivot your engineering degree and go into just about anything else math/logic based. Make some money in finance, have some solid investments, and gtfo in a few yearsWhy not take a year out to travel once you graduate and get it out of your system? Then get your engineering job afterDo it.  Nows the time.  Otherwise you’ll be stuck in a cubicle for 20 years and wake up one morning and hang yourselfLive a comfortable life and put most of your salary into weekly calls in literally anything for a year. Then retire.

You're welcome, I don't even take fees.i said fuck that shit and now im living the wsb lifeTake 6 months off.  Travel the world.  By the end of it you will be ready for a stable job and friends.if you got that degree from a US institution, i regret to inform you that you know nothing about engineering yet. you’ll learn it on the job though so no worries.Life has a way of taking you where you really intend to go. Your present may not seem like that but if you put in the effort and make most of the opportunities that come your way you may actually end up achieving what you wanted to. You can not control the outcomes you can only control your actions. The moment you realize this and focus on your actions with 100% conviction you will feel free. That freedom is far more important than what people give it credit for. This is coming from a retard that got engineering degree in a foreign country and is now working in his 6th country.Huh...Bro engineers get to travel and work all over you dumb ass.. Literally construction nomads go all over the place and engineers get treated the best. Trust me you crying fagguette you wouldn't last a day doing the actual work you're better off flashing your degree at people and telling them why it's mathematically supposed to work on paper. such a kidFind a job where traveling is expected and see the world (or your own backyard) at your companies expense. Then go off on your own when you can afford it.Lmao as a professional engineer I can tell you your school experience is nothing like industryEnjoy the situation while it lasts. This either goes well or very bad depending if he passes legislation he promised. Then again, it seems the lockdown made it print for us so who tf knowsGuy can’t even spell the ticker right. I’m in!It’s AAPL you uncultured swineApply just trying to unlock meme strength with the EV shitIf that was the case a better company than Hyundai would’ve signed with them.

Asking for a friend.It's always peak euphoria after TSLA goes crazy lolits pronounced euphoriaManipulationReally no good reason other than metals being heavily manipulated. Good reason to own physical gold and silver. One day the spring will pop and silver will go from $25 to $150 overnight. Gold will go up a ton too but not as much as silver.

ICLN TO DA MOON🚀🚀🚀😵🤯I'm not sure you are understanding what free speech is. Free speech is the right to be protected from prosecution by the government for what you say. A separate corporation allowing you to use or not use its platform is not protected in any way by free speech.

I agree with you that it's a little worrisome but they have no legal obligation to let you say shit.You can speak freely all you want. But you aren’t entitled to use those platforms as you see fit in your own discretion.No one is obligated to help you spread your messagedo you not understand that the tech companies choosing not to host that content is itself free speechYou are welcome to stand on a corner and say things within reason. These companies don't owe you shit.Because it's their platform? if you want free speech, just go talk outsideWe really are fucked. You’re either too dumb to realize this and agree with it or your too lazy to careMy in-laws are immigrants who lived in the USSR before and after the collapse (Ukraine).  They tell me this movie looks familiarT...they give themself that power. We’re a capitalist country...so businesses can make their own decisions?  You can host and discuss whatever topics you want, you won’t be imprisoned lol.  Trump and Parler were banned for inciting violence. Your free speech can’t cause harm to someone else because that infringes THEIR rights. Whole “can’t yell fire in a crowded theater” thing.Twitter is just an Internet forum. Internet forums have rules, which they can set themselves. That the president of the United States chooses it to be his main outlet of communication is ridiculous in the first place, and now it shows. 

Nothing to do with freedom of speech. Everybody can still say what you want. Just not on certain Internet forums..🤡Free to speak as long as you aren’t mega phoning lies and inciting violence for millions of dummies to believe. Oh, and it’s also a private company and you’re using their service.Agreed. By shutting down their outlet, you don't pacify your enemies, you drive them to lash out even stronger.Your butt must really hurt to think that we care if you’re conservative.Yes on Reddit. Differing opinion = hate speech.Y'all releasing incel vibes, get fucked with your victim mentality.Whatbaby off a balcony?Links?We try to have ONE small violent insurrection and the libs are losing their shit and censoring usThey loved free market capitalism til it came for them lmao.Just build you own internet broSaturday: "We have many competing for our business"

From what I read, at least as far as the car industry, it's mainly due to new cars being more complex and thus needing more semiconductors. So more demand.

The question can only be answered by you. Clearly, it’s good to have savings and not yolo it all on advice from a meme stock sub. It’s the level of risk YOUR willing to take. Clearly, there are much more stable investments with much smaller returns. This is a casino (with a Wendy’s in the back).Always, ALWAYS keep back up cash when pour.Keep 6 months of expenses in cash as reserve for bad times.Honestly wait for some big pullback. Current run, even if you expect a long term bull market, is beyond insanity/euphoric levels so any minor red day is likely to trigger a sell off (don’t expect something March levels by like a -5% week would be healthy). Have some stocks that you wouldn’t mind owning and sell some puts after a big red day to take advantage of increased IV/premiums and generate some income without having to use all of your capitalLook at the karma number we can confirm!!!!People in HERE claiming to buy leaps 9/10 times sell that shit within a week.

On one end - fuck Nazis. On another end - don’t tell me what I can and can’t say.A belt is a belt to me man idk bout that I’d buy a nice jacket or watch or shoesAfter looking at the price of those... absolutely not. Unless there’s a whole belt market you know about where this can be an investment that appreciates in value (similar to watches or baseball cards) then please don’t spend that kind of money on a belt lol.

On the other hand - if you REALLY fucking want it and think it will make you happy then get the thing. But don’t fall into the trap of consistently buying shit because you think it will make you happy... hedonic adaption always wins and you’re typically left not really giving a shit about the thing after awhile (this doesn’t seem like it will be your issue since you have trouble spending money on yourself).

On the other other hand. No matter how much money I make, I’m still super frugal and spend my money practically. If you’re not like this and have the money and want to spend the money and it won’t screw with you financially then fuck everything I said and get your leather straps son.TSLA calls dudeYea man buy the beltyolo. every year you have one less birthday.pure paper handI mean I sold a couple of things in my Roth Friday but damn just hold and hedge and keep cash on hand or something.be strong brother 💎👋 zero or hero🦸‍♂️You will regret that decisionYou’re pretty retarded if you think ICLN is a shitty, overbought meme.

We have moved from the previous censorship of objective calls to violence into new territory. Change in regulation=more censorship. They’re scrubbing more and more off the bathroom walls and eventually people are going to assume that what you don’t scrub off is what you stand for. If you scrub nothing it’s clear that your establishment doesn’t align with the writing even if it is subjectively wrongI only use Trump because he is a very easy example. Like I said, I could give less of a fuck about the politics surrounding the issue. But now it’s pretty undeniable  the tech giants are more powerful than the government. How we continue from here is unknownBanning trump, so hot right now!Exactly, but if they choose not to host terrorists, they need to be held accountable for said terrorist posts, no?In terms of stocks, doesn’t matter.

Hurricanes rarely hit Florida. I doubt some of you dumb motherfuckers don't realize Florida went without a landfall from 2005-2017. Which leads to point 2 fuckers.

They put the space industry in Florida cuz da canes don't hit and being a lowly Space Force employee I know the biz is growing. 

So we got jobs and no hurricanes. Proving your point useless.Thank god. Its too crowdedHe’s probably citing the 26 year old Boeing plane that went down in Indonesia. Sad story but there’s a reason why Indonesia has a major plane crash every year....One of their planes crashed right as it took off in oingo boingo country. They did not fuel their 🚀 enough.Another Boeing crashed yesterday. Most likely due to bad maintenance on the part of airlines, but I don’t think retail investors would think this through since it is bad publicity for Boeing again.

Hyundai Motors (and Kia) double down to invest $87 billion into GOEV over a span of 5 years to develop smart electric vehicles, with an ambitious goal of over 25% of total auto sales being electric vehicles by 2025

Hyundai Motors just acquired an 80% controlling stake in the creepy robot company Boston Dynamics

Hyundai is working with Apple on "Project Titan", an electric vehicle project. Will GOEV be involved with Apple's smart car?

Apple's smart car is projected to hit consumers in 2027, and be sold as an "experience" that changes our perception of auto travel. Think if Steve Jobs achieved ipod level creativity and success with electric vehicles

BlackBerry has entered a deal with GOEV to produce for their cars the ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) aka the computer/software of the car

Now imagine it's 2027, and the first fleet of autonomous, electric smart cars hits the streets. Branding by Apple, sold by Hyundai, designed by GOEV, programmed and secured by BlackBerry.

Subscription based smart electric vehicles.Well there is a 'business update' tomorrow...with negative news it might be your chance!


There is also NCLH and RCL, which could be better opportunities. I'm married to CCL because I've held since May...so I have to hold for tax reasons...CCL had 8 billion in October, now they SHOULD still have a year left. There is still dilution potential though, so who knows...If it continues to climb I'm definitely going on a cruise as a celebration. I'll be 21 which means I can go on the cruises by myself too!Haven’t bought yet but getting as many $80 calls as I can tomorrow🍄TSLA bears been out in full force since market closed on Friday and TSLA went down 1% ahI feel like it reeks newly rich or low rich.Tacky does not mean ugly.🤦‍♂️BruhWhat about VALE?The message is be modest. No need to kill yourself financially and physically to impress people you won’t see decades laterSome people do prefer renting and having done both, I can see the argument for renting long term. There’s pros and cons to both bro. Houses are a pain in the ass, anytime something breaks it’s on you to fix it and pay for repairs, you are lighting money on fire to property taxes and mortgage interest so the argument against rent is kind of moot, and the whole bUiLdInG equItY argument is retarded - houses are not a good investment, likely to underperform the market, and very illiquid with high transaction costs. Only buy a house if you really want one, never because you think it’s a good financial decision. Ask any wealthy person and they will confirm thisThey’ll find out when taxes come around 😅Nah, not everyone. I’ve seen million dollar homes on auction sites being foreclosed and sold for cheap due to job loss, divorce, deaths, etc.Not for stocksI used to tell the ladies “I have a three inch dick and only last a minute.”

With rates staying near 0 until 2023, AtATs high debt suddenly is a huge benefit. They have massive cash flows to pay it down, while paying no interestOne-time dividend.

I've been around long enough to see this happen time and time again and I do not think itll end well for call holders (and the whole market tbh) this week. Hard run ups inevitably to lead to hard profit taking and people that think TSLA is exempt are going to learn the hard way to take profit where you can.This is what I’m thinking, I think we go to $32 tomorrowBeen in since units and agree, the only comparable pump was that one day there was the bloomberg rumor, and that was even less on a percentage basis.TrueI mean, it’s not a hot take or anything.

I mean Petco is IPO’ing this week, or also check other stocks in the same sector like Zoetis, Freshpet, Elanco, Trupanion all of them are killing it (well ran yes but a growing industry).  Video games are probably growing even faster HOWEVER GME’s business model is broken. No one buys physical games anymore specially not in a store. As per consoles most are purchased directly or via better ran retailers.  It’s simply a broken business model.  There are so much better companies why invest in a lottery ticket.> This means something and I must know what

Super strange but legit.Because I have calls and my bad luck overrides literally everything else.Do they come with a complimentary Pooh bear?I wanna hang outWish my grandpa woulda told me that when I had 1/15 $700c back in NovemberThat's what my grandma always saysNeverI chose not to accept your facts. First!Buy and hold long termIt rose 20% in the past 5 days. I'm just keeping an eye on a small correction to jump in. If all else fails, I'll probably still buy into a lesser degree and wait for a dip for calls.“Management positions”I played the TSLA split and made a ridiculous amount so.....buy a lot, this is no lottoPlans for more maga protest, I think things more unstable than they appearWhat are you doing in my diaryHaha true. I’m gonna delete the app but I’ll still be online occasionally 🤘🏼Neither yetthat's a smart idea, but I'm afraid I'll miss the last spike before it pops. 

I'm incrementally investing like that in dogecoin because I've been feeling froggy 🤪Crox at ICR tomorrow at 930am. Coupd be some price actionupvoting is hard work palSecond half of March I bought half way back in to indexes (up 60%). I saw we were trending back up and wanted to get in at least partially. The other half I mixed between theta gang, day trading, and buying fucking spy puts as a hedge (up 30%). 

My biggest regret was buying fucking spy puts with half my money and then having to dig my way out of that or I’d be up 100%+ on the other half instead of 30%... or 1000s of % if I bought calls instead...

Theta gang dug me out of the spy put losses lolFirst time in response to corona videos I was seeing from overseas, I knew the “it’s just a flu” the media was originally pushing was bullshit. It wasn’t just Trump originally pushing that bullshit it was everyone lol

I also bought a house with only 3% down in last January and am up over 10% on that... 

This time I think it’s from vaccines being overhyped and us being in complete euphoria. Everyone I know is recommending stocks and cryptos it’s insane. I also think that Russian and Chinese disinformation campaigns are going to tear us apart.Both. I think we are in clear euphoria. Everything purchasable is going up. Retail investors are almost tapped. Even my homeless brother is buying shit on Robinhood and giving me stock advice. 

Also, the divide in the US will only get worse. This is a byproduct of Russian and Chinese disinformation campaigns. We are playing right into their hands. As we continue to become more divided we may even see an invasion of Taiwan by China or continued invasion of Eastern Europe by Russia in the next couple years.Why?Can I change my flair at least lolApple should go to the 140 MarkRIP bearIT'S A CAPITULATION BROIt's not, he would've told me about a situation like thatTruly the worst outcomeRight, but they just set themsleves up to enjoy permanent non-support of 30% of America. That can bite them later and is going to hit user counts.No but having 30% of the country angry at you is still a short term profit hit as they switch and a legit long term legislative threat. Also butterfuck, OK businesses advertise wherever their customers are...LmaoThose are the delayed results, check investing.com.   dumpppppingIv is probably like 300%

I know it's sad lolActually did that for a while.. took a year off and moved to actually and just did volunteering work while traveling around the country and loved it. Parents and family convinced me to come back and finish my degree..So true as I’ve looked back on the small years I’ve been here I’ve gotten almost anything I really really wanted. The universe freaking scary for real...I like that perspective.. honestly been feeling like I’ve been fighting against “life’s path” for a few years now..Ik, I would say I’m pretty aware of the opportunities outside of “education” as an engineer.. and I’m not bagging on it it’s a great job (I’ve had multiple internships and have seen a broad range of jobs and opportunists).. just genuinely feel like it isn’t what I want to doI just sometimes find myself wishing I didn’t have the aptitude for it so I didn’t even have the option in the first place..They are literally just fomoing EV.

Just my thoughts, but it makes me sad.Your in-laws sound like they don’t know what the difference between a government limiting your free speech vs Twitter

TSLA is going to be the straw in the S&P as well.  All those wanting the market to stay this hot haven't seen what happens on the other side.

Most of the retail traders have little stomach when shit goes bad, and they don’t have the bank account either.

No one can tell me this isn’t because of stimulus checks hitting people’s Chase accounts and everyone is like, why not? The fed rate is so low there is nowhere else to go to make returns, but it cannot keep going.37.5 expiring next week for now.

Why do people not understand that the 1st amendment actually doesnt mean you can say anything...Got plenty of shoes and jacketsHonestly, I just enjoy getting classier designer belts. Something like Hermès would likely keep its value to some regard but I’m not looking to sell this item. It’s more of a personal pleasure then not. Shoes and belts, I’ve stopped growing and already have an extensive color list for pants, belts... not so much, shirts I could careless, I have some collectible items but mostly I just wear plain white T-shirts and whatever color jeans I feel like matching with my shoes. I like the fact that these belts are reversible and last forever. I’ve spent plenty of money on crap leather belts that end up trashed in a year plus. Honestly higher end belts only get better with time if you care for the leather. I’m mainly looking to add a new set of colors into my color way or belts.

I doubt this would financially ruin me. I guess I’m just trying to justify spending money on myself for my birthday. Just a single male with nothing available to do for my birthday so any money I would have spent on pre-covid activities is saved because I’m incredibly limited to what I can do, obviously everyone is.Check futures.

What did King George say?!hope it was a genius power play and u got paid 

cause if notI was wondering why the daily was so well moderated. ThanksI bought some last week at the dip and up at 10 percent. Probably pull out mid week once I feel good about the gains.So just buy all the LEAPS? Would it make any difference if I bought ITM or OTM?What kind for ICLN?Lol those hours are insane.good luck u got this20 hour days??? How are you still fucking aliveI’m in it I just want moarSame"Best" would represent the majority's consensus though.Kinda confused on the answer you are looking for. Alot of people are buying calls due to the stimmy pump and hype around the country going green. Calls = lots of risk if stimmy doesn't go through cuz potential dip then expiration.. Stocks =  less risk due to no expiration and lower volatility?Did not see that. Thought it was this year. You’ll prob make tendiesI'm down 10% atm.How?It is an ETF that traces the the fairly predictable VIX index or VIX index futures for your option purchasing pleasure. You can go short and long on VIX using UXVY, VIXY, VXX, VIXY, SVXY, VIXM. Each are designed to hedge for different timeframes.Oh like you think it will hit somethingGet rich off options you’ll get tons of puss puss. Chin up kingDoesn't matter, Dems love their regulations and conservatives are really really pissed right now. Like appease the masses level pissed.

 They'd like nothing better then to call it a monopoly slap them with antitrust lawsuits and look like the good guy.

I could totally see them taking a swipe at FAANGCambridge Analytica and disinformation was a serious issue in 2016 elections.I do agree that that's a big problem.I guess more risk based because if multiple stimulus force the fed (unlikely) to raise interest rates that will be the focus of 2021 and 2022 leading up to the midterm elections.

I don't think it matters per se and they'll pass a stimulus. $2k seems like small potatoes. Go big and give out $10k per personYou're rockets are kinda convincing, but why not CMC? :Dwhen it’s not subway ima find all of you and fuck you with a six inch extra mayoYea I’m good with whatever honestly. Every rumor has been a solid company and ackman can’t go wrong. I just want to see it within the next couple months otherwise I gotta push my calls out further again, and I really don’t want to sell them and pay the capital gains.Worth a shot LOL300k of it is on marginGlad it's nothing like that. I wouldn't wish it one anybody. 

I'm not going anywhere but to tendietown with my fellow autists.That theta tho😵Man and I thought $1080 eow was pretty retarded...I dunnoI see. What happened in September?Nice. Respect for putting your money where your mouth is. I think it’ll pay off. I’ve only got around $4k in this one but will probably buy more.Sorry... Was treasury yield... not too long ago this was in the .80% range. One of the measures to keep the printer brrring is low inflation, this is inflationary action

There's also been a treasury yield rate increase past 1%, but not finding the link for that. Basically they said the fed might have to step in.

EDIT: changed to treas yield > 1%I bought another call when it dipped to 38 briefly but still holding $30 2023 calls tooTicker?Maybe it’s time for another paper trading competitionPrint("Gang Gang")Maybe not in your area, if you are rural but it’s the most in demand fields. Overall.More than everything else regardless. STEM is always in demand and can go non-traditional routes far, far, more easier than a sociology degree.Political Science and Gender Pronoun Engineering doesnt count.Pretty much.Check other historical delisted stocks. I'm guessing it either pays out or gets zeroed. Probably dependent on if you can trade the stock after delisting announcement but prior to actual delisting. I highly doubt it'll happen though, NYSE already refused an EO to delist other 🇨🇳 companies.Same stressful division happened in 2016 post election. Idgaf what side you’re on man (I’m conservative) shit moves forward. Honestly half the shit that’s going on doesn’t effect your daily life so don’t stress out about it and just view life’s problems in general as cars riding past you while you sit on the side of the road. Don’t chase the cars don’t try and stop them just let them come and go.It’s always been this way. Now though we have two groups of people who can no longer agree to live peacefully with a shared set of values and each side is playing for keeps until one is flat out destroyed.Idk maybe... I'm holding nio for the long haul though so I just see it as a buying opportunityIn my early 20s I barely felt a hangover drinking shitty vodka all the time. I started feeling them in my late 20s. Im 33 now and they are brutal. Im scared of what older hangovers will feel like. I also drink daily so that doesn't help.I'm impressed. That's either a long time to remember a lot of knowledge you don't use or a lot of studying. Or both. Either way, good luck on your new job.Obviously mine 😬Yea but TSLA actually movesI'm playing ER too and have  1/22,1/29, 2/5, and 2/12.

Idk you’re smarter than me, I believe in u!I’m ICLN gang 4 life! It’s my largest position and have zero intentions to sell for the next 4yrs, roll call!!Haha I'm not a-scaredYou have a really short memory  because Tesla had a huge run up to Battery dayAgreed. I’m an ultra bull for TSLA. I think it’s going to keep consistently rising until 1T market cap. After that...I’m out lol. I’ll cheer for it to keep rising, but I’m done playing the lottery. If TSLA keeps pumping to $1,000 I’ll have made plenty enough to not care for moreSuch good times manWhy are you lying to this poor man lol. It’s only up 19%Holy fuck I’m stupid af.Ah rate cuts... we hardly knew ye...Think about whether anyone wants to hear that from you.

Just start posting again.Put the pill in liquid and waitIt’s hard to find but it exists.   It’s what docs use for big boy stuff$CLOVholy shit, I hope you feel better / get things fixed in an acceptable way.  I thought you were kidding.Will have to check that out. Wife gets it real bad and takes meds for it.Ill just use this example. If i own a business and someone comes in and starts screaming some people say this business is terrible and if something was done about that...i wont mention killing because that wouldnt be good but something. I should be allowed to kick that customer out and not be accused of censorship right? They can yell in the street if they want idc. Send a letter.it's the easiest marketing ploy right now. you'd be the worst fucking firm if you didn't take advantage of it.Lmao exactly, this guy thinks it’s 2005 and you can start up a blog in your basement that people will read. It all leads back to the tech establishment and it’s clear that if you don’t align with their views you will be shouldered out one way or anotherJFC really? Dude seems like he has a messiah complex.someone has never been to a live game lmaoToo much big money in it to let that hold though I thinkhow do you get those?I get it for sure. I’ve just seen people get screwed hard  using a stop loss. Flash crash can really mess shit up. You could use a stop limit to guard against this. But then that might not protect you from an actual crash. It’s a tricky subject. At the end of the day it’s on you and what you want to do. But if you have life changing money sitting there. I’d be figuring out a way to check on it at work. Good luck though! Not trying to freak you out. You’ll be fine!It's just a flavor of stop lossThat's weird afDon't have one, good genesIt never is. 

I’ve created enough wealth that my kids kids kids kids would never have to work (if I had kids). And it’s still not enough to keep me out of the muck every day. 

I’ve had to train myself to self-care, because when I break down I break down hard...and then I’m no good to the gigantic pile of people that depend on me to be sharp and effective every day. 

Set goals. Meet them. Reward yourself. That is the healthy and sustainable cycle.It grewYou have it too? Fuck I’m jealousThis is true, 400k for a house for me, that was 360 at the start of the pandemic and i closed thinking “glad I got it at this price”. Appraised 10k above closing price 3 weeks later (it’s brand new)I remember the last time buyers said thatlove u boobooThe saddest part is that a shitton of the support would go to rural whites.

They think everything is a zero sum game and don't understand an economy growing together and everyone getting more tendies.

They think getting rich is taking from others.Detroit? Islamabad? Kabul?We were exhausted and decided not to move. Prioritized and bought back our shares.I struggle a lot with psychiatric issues and I do believe cannabis helps cope with them. However, I've tried to quit several times unsuccessfully...Oh I’m sure NIO is getting a huge pump. But I think a lot of it will be premarket and I think NIO will open too high with too much premium to buy calls once the markets open. But if you’re like insanely ultra crazy bullish and think NIO is going to moon even harder than TSLA has recently, then I guess go for itI’m for sure buying in at a NIO dip. I’m uncertain if there will be one. But the premium NIO will be at open is not worth buying NIO at open. Unless NIO is going to pump like TSLA has been recently. That’s probably the only way it’s worth it. I’m just gonna sit out and watch. I’ll buy at dips if there are anyYeah at the age where its still kind of freak stuff people die my age from but imagine it gets much worse.And they’re expensive enough. I can’t think of another ticker with that volume/premium thoughOh so nonsense then? I've seen thousands of technical posts between here and stocktwits and most of them were wrong. I don't see how it's any different from picking heads/tailsOn $10 or $10,000?ah. then i assume i’ll be getting it tomorrow 9:30amA Lada.When it prints I’m taking profit, for right now it’s just a waiting game. 18c are probably smarter and will still give nice profit but I’m all in or all out on this one lolu/zjz this man gave 2 golden fuckboy awards pls give him a flair :(Just tell me what to short lolSorry JamesAfter being up over 100% the past month they’re down 10% today. 🙄They trade at less than 2 P/E even if 💩🪙 "tanks" all the way down to 28k. I will cum if we get a 33% dip to buy.Some days, the food bank is like living large. Other days, it’s just crap food.Ah so you too are a man of cultureya green is good, pot & energy.  no way green new deal happens this year though maybe 2022/23 if things are going okSeriously, it all tastes like shitYesBothdidn’t know ackman controls V and MABased.

OPEC cut production 
Banks aren't funding new explorations
Alot of oil companies are still below profitability
Industry massively shrank
Over all supply is being cut
EV market isn't replacing vehicles at a fast enough rate to offset current demands

TLDR: Supply go down, cost to find new oil go up and harder means price go up. Even Cathie Woods highlighted this happening in her recent podcast 

I expect oil to trade atleast $70 a barrel and push to over $100 so the existing companies and countries can exit strategy to fund new investmentsI'm gonna take a look at SLV again. But funny money is correlatedI have quite a few TSM calls and was thinking of getting more, but the IV is kinda high going into this weekI’m fucking sorry I reminded everyone. Imma go #ropeMLK day my guyWhat’s a good expiry for the LEAPS?Oh yea if you’re talking shares just hold that shit. Short term idk seems to be trending down but it had a good run end of year. Probably hit 60-70 soon tbhWow he just set one up“yes definitely” he has stressed on his Chinese identity instead of Taiwanese on multiple occasions so…Because Tesla the company cannot possibly hope to meet the valuation of TSLA the stock. The market has at this point priced in TSLA owning more than 100% of the EV market.If it gets posted here all day long followed by 🚀🚀🚀🚀 it’s a memeYes obviously I know about the Hyundai thing...what is the added news over the weekendIll be watching and pulling for you.holy fuck were retarded hereThe only thing I’m worried about is inflation, but inflation is needed after the crash last March so maybe it’s not a problem. I just can’t see the economy recovering then immediately crashing again.If interest rates stay low/zero I dont see it dropping, where else can people put their money? HYSA before march were 2.30% APY or more now they are 0.2%I’m never holding anything through the holidays again lmao, lost 60% of my gains and got them all back afterMeant never loved but beaver love sounds funnierI can't afford one im poorMy wife came home and said have you ever listened to that song.  Holy shit.  Creepy.The only Dork is the Dad that can't seem to find anything in common with there Kids.It should dip this week, Along with IV. But I’m not sure how low it goes, I’m buying if it goes below $16 cuz Cohen bought at $16, but who knows it could go lowerSometimes i will buy if the price is right earlier, nothing specific about 1030, just choice. You likely will pay a premium if you want something right at 930 (sometimes you can find deals tho)The reason they have a profit is because they sell carbon credits. They also have way less volume than any other car company. Shit’s actually retarded this bubble will burst HARDHow much did they dip?Goodthat is why invest in the deflationary currency (Orangecoins)lol okay then I guess everyone who predicted TSLA hitting 800 was wrong because they predicted it too early. Shit logic!RemindMe in 1 monthEh not if you make bank. Bears get so much shit but it’s very possible to make good money as a bear. People on here act like you always have to be bull or bear. But why not be whichever one makes sense in the moment? So many permabulls on here acting like it’s a bad thing to see an overvalued asset and bet against it. Probably because they think it’s easier to just spam buy calls and hope you aren’t the last to fomoTy. They are tiny openings. It’s weird. I hope I can still find loveGod speed, retardJust gotta figure out how to get around all that camo. Hopefully they got good programmers.Go back to the fucking grave Bernanke, JPOW prints harder and longer than you ever couldSuggestion?I hear u/cashflow_ has an inverted penisI definitely took profit. Short term i had 1/8 60.5s made 200%ish on those. “Longer” term. I have a bunch of 1/29 60s, 3/19 57.5s, and 3/19 60s. Up between 100-200% on those. Will trim the 1/29s aggressively into conference rumors this week. And keep the 3/19s to play takeout/earnings. 

EDIT:takeout *rumors*Whats dollar tree protein powder like?That’s what I’m doing, there’s speculation that’s it’ll be 25-35, if you like the way the company looks then you could even hold past then. Idk, not your financial advisor

Buy the rumor sell the newsI have 1000 shares at $11Theta gang can hopeI tried waiting for a dip but it never went down. ICLN is looking like a good long term hold especially with Biden.


- Position: 9 shares of ICLN. no optionsI bought it as a joke.  Kept it because it's awesomeI’ve got 60% of my portfolio in ARKK. I just want some solid, consistent gains. I’m going boomer style.Of course not kingGot money on the over or under? My producer probably put money on them. Who they playingAgain as a non footballian—good for them! Hope they take out the packers at the super bowl (or can they not because AFC and something something.... I’m trying man sorry)P bullish to me ngl the plane was old af means they will need to buy a new oneI think it's a long position to hold. They've bottomed out as much as I think they will, and at this point, it's whether they decide to stay in business or not. I'm pretty sure they will, so it's just the long game.

When they bounce back, we'll clean up.how do you see corn?I would love a transfer to the US honestly, hoping I can do that with my company. You guys seem to run steady and pay well. 

I don’t work rigs or anything though so I have some decent job stability. Covid really hit hard though.Official news of signing deal with Hyundai for iCar by end of the quarter.EV rumors. Apparently there are talks of a partnership between Apple and HyundaiBetween that and what Q4 expectations look like, I would say we see a massive run through the month.Bubbles always pop eventually. It takes a while tho. And then you buy that fucking dip and do it again. 

Bubble has a long ways to go before popping. We’re about to expand green energy on a global scale that’s never been done in any sector at this rapid of a pace. EVER. 

The depth and breadth of this green energy expansion is the largest in history, by like 1000 fold. It’s gonna be a rocket ride for a while.Same hereThat's a really interesting question, and I don't know the answer. I will say that I just paid $5K for historical options data, after writing code for months for my new bot. 😬

You are correct that volume is a signal worth examining. I haven't really backtested it, though. I'm not sure if it's as strong a signal in predicting tops, as it is in predicting bottoms. I think declining volume on a multi-day selloff is a good predictor of bottoms. We saw this in March 2020 and March 2009. The idea is this: bottoms are formed, not when buyers come into the market, but when there are no more sellers. When there are no more sellers, the only direction is up. 

It's hard to get good intraday volume data.Ya Burry bets money while Elon builds multiple multi-billion dollar companies. Know who I'm going with.Blue or pinkBasically every stock is a bubble right nowI think it’s because the event was turned into a giant media circusif i run you over with a tesla, are u gonna blame elonFlorida man lives there and this guy ∆Tydie CCP scumBruh...that’s why i said itI hear that! It's how I started (multiples of 9) and rounded up to 100. And I've heard varying things about Robinhood, either that they just pay out the warrant or will actually let you convert. I'd rather convert if it's a good merger, but don't know what to expect with Robinhood, everybody's favorite broker.ExplainNice I'm thinking the same thing. Hold shares through merger.  Get that money man.  Let's hope for a good weekBan post screenshotGood question, no answer yetA vulture the size of a small two seat electric vehicle.

It swings to 820 or below abandon ship mate

And buy the dip laterLiterally google everything about their Q4 and iCar. I’ve explained this to 7 people on here today. No one fucking researches this shit anymore.i don’t remember either reddit created it for me or i was fucked up when i made itIt's when he got banned and for how longEnough DD for me, what’s the Sofi SPAC?But what’s the SPAC ticker for it?Looks like bug fixes and improvements but who knowsI got mine after I updated the appLMFAO 29.5B on < 1B of Rev?

I’m sure it’s gonna include some green stuff in there.I read it was set for Feb 11th.ya BA is a tough one, should rebound in the commercial planes but assume defense cuts coming in new adminhow long u think the dip gonna last? a one day type of thing or all week?Thank you for the tip. Much loveHmmmm

I’m hella long term bullish on GOEV but got impatient losing money on it everyday for no reason. Might have to buy back inMake sure you get 100 stock so you get some on board credit with whatever one you cruise with.Go higher bro. If your buying two years out buy higher strike prices man.Ah, sorry. You’re right, didn’t really think about what you said. No it’s not tacky (in my opinion). Tacky either means cheap or bad taste. Lambos aren’t cheap and taste is subjective. 

Overall, tacky is a bad term to use for a lambo in my opinion. You either like and/or admire it, or you don’t, but you certainly don’t ever talk it down because it just screams jealousy.Which is why I went on to say the second part. And also a million dollar home ain’t shit these daysDon't worry, so has theirsYou might be right. I saw one of my friends who lives alone for the first time in 6 months this weekend and his social skills were so rusty I don’t know if he’ll ever recover. Pretty sadI feel you, homes. This year fucked up me, but at least money was made.


We just gotta get vaccinated, head back to the gym and build our confidence back up.I agree and I think Tesla is overvalued but the guy needs to shut up because he has much of a clue about Tesla stock as we do....okay?Per contract I guess. Was looking at June expiryno they don't lmaoWtf does a price target matter if you don’t know the valuation you are getting on the companyThat was a really risky clickGod you're autistic 💀I have tlry and nobody talking about itAnd don’t forget PLTR lolCorrect. TSLA is like a hybrid. It’s a meme stock, but it’s also very real.Thanks good sirNo problem bro. Im glad to help. Im  gonna try the recipe u/kangadoood put out there. 

I feel like it could be delicious but the window of ideal texture is limited. If the original recipe he put out is legit, I’d like to through some poprocks in there...really try to engage all the senses. Not so much that it overwhelms the palate...enough for the dewmeal to still feel carbonated.Yea but their revenues are on a decline unless hbo max can offset box office revenues, hopefully they can dump directtv and raise cash to be able to compete with Verizon & T-mobile which are ahead in 5g.It's available at Total Wine.

Take Uber and Lyft's valuation, add it to the next 9 major automotive manufacturers, and they're collectively still worth less than Tesla.thats fine and all. but...to be the only company selling cars? you're smoking some shit.God told me soThat’s hilarious, X gang!How do you know?Blue senate was 100% unexpected and hasn't been fully priced in yet thoughLmao, mine is way lower than thatwhere do i look up futures at?It'll actually be cheaper than that by JuneThis is the wayI’d love to see that (though I’m not opposed to a dip).Dw power will be back up by tomorrowLiterally none of these are an inverseWtf are you talking about?I hope you’re right but I was playing it like earning. Buy the rumor sell the news#IV crush enters the chatThere’s a DD post here that explains it. Basically their filing is unique and in favor of investing in shares. For every 9 shares you hold post merger you get at least 1 or 2 more warrantsThat is retarded.   Do it yourself lmao.  But the oldest boy who plays siege said the connection has been more stable with no hiccups and we have like 20 devices connected at all times.  1gb fiber line fyiThe app that comes with it is super simple and easy to use. Can see alot of the traffic going through each device, etc. I believe when you walk away from each pod, it connects you to the closest pod. Cool stuff like that. The only drawback is that each pod only has 1 ethernet portPaper hands — close your positions with a loss at open, or...wait until mondays power hour and close your positions with profit.  This is merely a dip to buy. Crash isn’t happening until late Jan early febAll of that was secondary to how his license plate looked.Funny you mentioned that, buddy of mine moved to MA for a couple years so I changed my registration to that state to save on insurance and inspection on my all manual Toyota Corolla.  This was when I was very young, humble beginnings.HIGHER CHAD!!And what about his bet on Herbalife?

That being said I still have $10k in PSTH because of the SPAC hype.No way in hell will it ever drop below 400A lot of reports of "brain fog," inability to concentrate, and headaches, with symptoms lasting several months. It's still too early to tell if it's the kind of thing that will just clear itself up given time but seems to be affecting enough otherwise healthy people that I'm not going to put myself at undue risk. I'm trying to make money and retire while I still have some youth left, leaving myself mentally 20 years older is counterproductive.

Sorry to hear your mental health has been struggling.Literally just a slight cough and feeling tried for a week. I understand it’s tough for people who are obese and over the age of 75, but if ur not in those categories it’s better than most coughsSeems like PLTR 27-28 has been fairly safe the last few weeksI did sell my NIO calls and my BABA stock (both up) but the BABA calls were already down 80% so I figured maybe there is some upside. I think I've learned not to buy LEAPs that  cost more than $2k--but I'm about to buy some SQ leaps that cost that much tomorrow I think....I really love the semi’s this month. NVDA AMD TSM MU

That’s my recommendation. I’ve got about $600k in leaps and calls across those four tickers rn270s for feb and 300s for AprilWell the IV crush that people talk about is when idiots buy way OTM options around earnings for which they pay a lot of premium due to high IV. After earnings, even if they are right in their directions the stocks doesn’t move enough to cover the expected move so they end up losing money as the IV volatility, and hence premiums, collapse after earnings. Of course, the opposite can happen where as market had a expected move we’ll below the realized move and that is when you make bank or lose a lot if you’re selling premiumOh damn, count me in!Steel Dynamics (STLD) is said to be producing the cybertruck steelMeanwhile, Cleveland up by three touchdowns already lmfaoBut will it thoHow much does TD charge per trade?You're finethat's messed upBeen in THCB since $10.70 try again

Or do you think you're the only one capable of original thought.Hmm...I'm clearly too transparent with my wordsJokes on him, my wife stole thatI’m trolling, obviously you wait til it pops then by calls. I was saying QCOM is currently nearly double the price at the top of the bubble. So if TSLA follows the same trend, 2040 is when it doubles in priceIt’s different this time 💎Ban for suggesting banIt's generally a bit volatility my dudeDawg USA is not Japan, just enjoy the ride for now. We got two years of free money and basically 0 interest. What’s the catalyst for a huge crash like last MarchYeah, don’t get in at open$30 April expiration 😎But uncertainty not good thoughNo we said puts> Stripe chief executive officer Patrick Collison squashed the rumor like a bug on the sidewalk.  

https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2020/12/pershing-square-stock-will-find-a-merger-partner-before-its-deadline/amp/Well that’s convenient for everyone trying to pump it as a Stripe merger when everyhings pointing to it not going that way. Theres no law about them talking about going public, and the founders keep saying they have no intentions of doing that anytime soon. Can you show me something that points to it being Stripe aside from you wanting that to be the case?Prolly a good idea. i think their earnings report is Feb 18th.Neat. Mines a 19, grimmspeed j pipe, top mount, boost control solenoid, intake, inverted bilsteins, bunch of other stuff. Love the carNo, just small.>$QS

That's what I think as well, as that's exactly what my TA Bot says.Hang in there. The people you need in your life aren’t always who you think they are.I was locked up for one day does that give me more cred than Akon? Holy shitthat press release is from Wednesday: https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-proposal-enable-online-sports-wagering-part-2021-state-stateThats a good play, thanks. I'm in.I sold some $20 1/15 GH IV. Can’t believe there’s ppl that stupid out there lmaoBut let’s be real the returns unless you have fuck loads of 100’s of shares are terrible selling covered callsSo brave. Live your truth broRoku has gone up quickly. It will probably max out then dip in a week. They’re not TSLA.Yes, me too. But amazon isn't splitting.But it you didn’t have any🚀🚀🚀But why though?Eh I wouldn’t touch it with a ten foot pole unless it crashed to March levelsSPY will drag it down with it. That is usually the case when SPY diesDepends on if you think people will genuinely give up that tech because if what’s going on. Outrage is fickle and normally short lived. Full disclosure, I think Twitter is a cesspool and only good for finding things out real time and otherwise it’s just a sharks vs jets circlejerk. FB is just where people post crap for their families or just share random crap to other boomers. Really full disclosure, AAPL is bae. But also I hate it when it stagnants for months for no reason!That’s under that assumption that each and everyone one of them is going to completely boycott the companies in perpetuity. It would be generous to even say that 0.5% of republican voters will never do business with big tech forever. 

This then also touches on the point as to why the market is ATH while the economy is in the shitter. Poorer people are shits out of luck at the moment, but those with good jobs have continued to earn well. Vast majority of great jobs are in major cities, that are always predominately democratic. 

Someone from Butterfuck, OK is extremely unlikely to buy a Pelaton, as opposed to a person from San Francisco.If he violated his contract and they let him go that's fine.  If he's within the bounds of his contract then fuck em let him do his.True! Doesn't mean people have to be ok with it. Power dynamics also come into play. Twitter is the David to Trump's Goliath, here. Same as Kaepernick to the NFL.It’s joe Biden’s America. Now we support corporations ultimate authority!! But only on removal of free speech!!!!For 2020, same. No shame.Ah. In that case finish your degree then use your maths skills to live off stock market tendies and become a nomad hahaThis is exactly what i am saying. Our intelligence is too limited to grasp the workings of the universe. The best way is to control the controllable and be blissful.What happens is we try to make sense of our future based upon our present and discount the changes brought in by the consequences of our actions that are yet to happen. So you can not really look into the future. Focus on your preset and take charge of your actions. It’s as simple as that. An apple tree will only bear an apple , it may be late to bloom but if it’s growing it will definitely bear an apple.Well try this out for size my company got bought by a much larger company and I got 150k in straight cash. Only had been there a year. If you’re actually smart and get to a good company you can make good ass moneyYeah lol. I’d buy one but let’s be real no one is gonna have the same kind of self driving innovation and other quirkiness of daddy 🍉6 1/2Of course. Zip locked baggied to maintain freshness.Getting more comfortable🤣🤣😍Oh shit LOLKk fine at least 2 to 5 baggers, happy? 😂So we should nationalize facebook?Easy, communicate the same way you use to before they existed. You sound entitled. At the end of the day they are a BUSINESS  and a BUSINESS can decide who they offer their SERVICES  to.Because they only have that power because you use themI did that for the firs time in a while yesterday and saw a robocop video.When your company basically controls speech, ya. This isn't a mom and pop bakery.

But glad you are ok with big tech deciding what is ok for you to hear. Don't like it? Stay off it. What's the problem?Not being democrat = hosting nazisWas able to get Feb calls for $25 a while ago and I’m rolling in it. I believe it’s gonna keep printing hence more callsThank god I was out at that time (sold for a small loss a month before), got back in after.

I told my dad to put all his money in VRTX, good thing he never listens to me or I would have been disowned.Oops I thought he said gravityyou're thinking of *charles* dickensWell if you get back in I'm the proud holder of 12 calls total.  Half 110 and half 105 02/19 monthlies.

Earnings is the next week after that expiration.

Kept averaging down when it was hovering around 100, bought all the 110s when it was 108 so was down bigly.One of the few times diamond hands have paid offWatching my wolves lose to the Spurs for their 8th str8 loss.

If you eventually make the mistake you’ll think of this comment and be like ‘holy fuck, he was right’This is a true cetaphil user, nobody buys it without cringing at the price. I’ll keep that in mind thanks famJust would assume they will have a hard time making money with interest rates so low for the foreseeable future.

Yea huhI knew a guy in school who could squeeze white shit out his nipsOh I 100% agree. I’m saying - freedom of speech is great but don’t be surprised when you tell someone to hit you in the face with a twisted tea, they do it.If it’s really want you to splurge on then go for itI think they just hate womenHmm my bad I was confused.. I actually don’t know about that but I assume it works the same way the buying price is. So yeah I bet The interest doesn’t change until openThis is WSB you clown. This is for gambling and good luck using rationality in this market. 

BANLmao all good brotha. That’s what we autists are here for. For “guidance” 🤡They didn’t even respond though. That’s disrespectful as hell. I agree Tesla has been doing good steady grinding but they have some major issues with quality to this day. Where’s the Elon that slept on the floor next to the machines?Dope, you looking to double down or just ride it through the year? Seems like a safe and more stable investment relative to individual clean stocks.But they BOUGHT it right? Bc EARNINGSKinda tasts like fish tbh, tried that already... she is beautiful tho, would say model like!She doesnt like analYou still get buzzed from nicotine? Like a teen?“everyone else is wrong but me”If I can get banned for 35 days for shitting on America, he can get banned for trying to shill ChinaWhen the dude does literally nothing but post on pro CCP subreddits it's safe to call them a China shillAgain, what are you raving on aboutNIO?the only thing you're trying to be is stupidAnd your source is some random twitter account that had like a 6-word tweet and nothing about nukes or anything of the sort?

Delusional? I think we all can see who is delusional here 😂😂😂Yes but he said wait for a pull back because they will fall over time with no product for years. Get out of here.Few days before. Should start running up I’m pretty bullish on FBI actually bought nio calls cuz I love money so suck on these balls bitchIt will take approximately 45 seconds😂😂 so in your opinion, the market will never have a red day ever? Just admit, you’re down 80% all timeYou should short GME. Sounds like you’re well versed about the company.YesExtreme Tendie Finder?You mean VIX?How ok’d are you? I’m 33 and feel like 44 but that’s because i was born and raised in a country in a different country. I’m a proud American now. I’ve been drinking sorry about the sentence structure and misspelling lolCuz market at ath basically moving money from cash to stonks. Falling yield = expectation of more monetary stimulusNah I don't. Just a wife. Seriously tho man, if you have that little touch should not be risking money in the stock market. This shit is vicious. Only play what you can afford to lose.

Hope you guys get shit figured out and can gain some savings. 

This sub is fun and I love gambling. But I'm not gonna if I lose my trading funds.Alright then ill let you on the SLV train hop on were on our way to 15% 🚀🚀🚀🚀One of the best.

And NIO gets a BofA upgrade reiterating buy w/ a $70 PT.

SorryGo back and read our discussion again, but slower this timeShould exit on Wed or Thu the lastest to avoid sell off Fridays.Ummm probably 50. 
I’m holding shares now. I’ll buy into leaps for next year if there’s a dip again.Honestly, alive just not well. I sleep through my weekends and then right back to the grind. Gotten used to running on 2-3 hours of sleepAlso this is Wallstreet bets sir this is a casino...❤️Oh well, give it a year and you’ll be doing just fineGot it so I wanted to hedge for 2021, which one would you recommend ?If you don’t know what Call Options are, that’s an entirely different conversation .By or before a certain date. That's what options are. Calls are betting it will go up from where it is, Puts are betting that it will go down from where it is. Calls are the option to buy, Puts are the option to sell.

Each contract gives you control over 100 shares. You don't own the shares, but you have the *option* to purchase or sell them at the strike price. You also have the option to sell your contract to someone else, which is how most options trading goes down.

Read up, my friend, there is money to be made and lost!Stimulus in 2020 seems to have barely staved off deflation. I would be extremely surprised to see CPI go above 2-3% in 2021. Rates aren't going up until we near natural unemployment again.just one of the founding steel stock of AmericaOh my god whyyI’m saying people here are panicking easily retard, not that we’re definitely going green.I admittedly probably bought too early. I could see it dropping down to $15-16 if tomorrow's a red day, but we'll see.For perspective, the 10 year yield was between 2-3% for most of 2011-2019. 0.80% is extraordinarily low, historically.I mean if they don't want the dollar to go to 0 and lose all global purchasing power, they're gonna need to do something to offset the printing lol raise taxes, etc.S-c-r or t-s-c-r-f. Still otc in US but they have Canada's most popular sports app and second most popular in the US. Deals with NBA, Penn and other casinos to open up sports betting as it's legalised across us states and Canada which largely has bipartisan support to raise tax revenue for all the covid expenses. They have like 500 million users monthly and are uniquely positioned to have betting inside an already popular sports app.

Doesn't have to get anywhere near dkng to payoff big time, if they do end up competing with dkng then tendie heaven.

I have 27.5k shares and will probably add more.I've always thought those were great.Yes that’s the statistic, but there’s more nuance. For example a Biology degree in generally useless unless you get more education

Just buy $Tesla yoloThanks man. I studied for around 6 months. My current job is rough on me mentally and physically so it was motivation.#collusion!!!!!It’s bout to be fuck u/DonCorleone47 in the ass bets you dumb fuckYou'd think so but ICLN gapped up overnight when Biden's nomination was confirmed on January 6th despite there being no legal way for Trump to beat him there

The market is retarded and will react to news like Paris because retail investors can't think more than 2 weeks in advanceYeah.. I’m missing something, I’ve always had this.You're a true American patriotThey typically make money off of AUM and other products. We are so used to doing our own trades that we are like "wait what why would you have someone else make your trade" - I lifted the below off of a popular WM firm just to illustrate how they make money from the above.

**Representative Assisted Trade Fee**$25 additional per trade*Flat-rate commission and fees apply*Didn't the markets drop like 15% or so something 3 weeks before Battery day?

Love them, but I miss so much of the game cuz I’m fucked up, talking to people, just doing whatever.  If you actually wanna watch the game, TV gives you a better experience, you can’t argue with that.https://ark-funds.com/subscribeI appreciate the help. Even if I get dicked and it ends up selling at 830 or 820 a share, it’s still life changing money. I’m up over 700% from what I bought them. If that dips to 650% yeah it would suck, but I’ll be okay. I’m going through pilot training right now and our flights can take up to 6 hours, can’t really be on my phone in the plane hahaMaybe it has to do with the volatility. All the other stocks I own I can. Very oddAlright alright alrightSome would say production is better than consumption. I guess I’m looking for a balance, but I’m not sure ik what would be right.

I’m going to try and get April 130 calls tomorrow morning if it isn’t up too much.Ah I’m Canadian so I didn’t see it on my stay holiday list.. I feel cheatedId take as far out as you can. It depends on how much you want to pay for each contract.But ICLN has had quite the runup lately.

Gotta have something safe and consistent.I don’t bet on sports anymore and I am a lifelong Browns fan so I would never gamble on my team.They could actually.  Browns (AFC) beating the Pack (NFC) in this Super Bowl would be perfectly reasonable after this year.Sounds like a plan B)

I also think IF there is some correction, we are insulated being in the travel sector!Nice! Didn’t hear about that!Good to know I'll be on it market openYa, I’ve got exposure to ICLN & holdings within. I may add to some positions that are already +100%. I typically sell half my stocks that I’m +100% on and let the rest ride ‘house money’ forever, but green energy will be huge. I’m keeping my eye on Commonwealth Fusion Energy coming soon. Fusion Energy will revolutionize energy as we know it.50/50The nice thing about options is you can win with puts OR calls...If I get run over by your Tesla because Tesla's autopilot fucked up, yes I'd blame Tesla.May Allah be with us all and bring us many tendies🧎‍♂️I’m American just not retarded and 🥭 washedNot sure how RH will handle warrants, I've heard so many different things about that on this sub. I haven't contacted them directly about it. I do use rh, but I own my psth shares on tda just in caseEvery share you buy comes with 2/9 of a warrant, to be received once you hold through the merger, so for every 9 shares you buy you will receive two warrants post-merger. The warrants will have a strike price of $23, if I understand correctlyI'm expecting some up and down until a merger is confirmed. Since I haven't heard any news yet, I'm not convinced we're gonna hold 30, but I'm always hopefulhttps://i.imgur.com/2uS4JoI.jpgFight me for itSorry for picking your brain for your opinion. down voted..It's a ban day - you were banned on the 10th of December 2020 for 2 days (1 bans total)

I was banned on the 6th of October for 35 days (1 ban total)InterestingI want to learn sports betting have you made some tendiesNo idea my friend, but I'm still long the market. Could go tits upI’m guessing you Called it a split because those places have pen of 50%. Lots of beatable games but so much heat these days which leads to travel. I was lucky enough to have a hole card game last me a year at my local casinoI'm all in Carnival Cruise so I clear the 100 stock bar. I bought in late April so you could say I saved the company, I deserve some on board credit!!!It’s just a year out and that’s the highest call option they have listed on robinhoodMulti million dollar homes ain’t shit either. Not many ppl are in the market for them, so it sits for years waiting for the right buyer. Then, when selling, might be for a significant loss. 🤢Thanks for the pep talk, I'm ready to go get them now 😊Who needs social skills when you have TSLA 1000c 1/15Luckily I got that home gym homie, hitting maxes left and rightFor me it's the...."I know I'm right play but I'm willing to pay a premium to long date it to make sure of it"I'm bought Jan 2022 putsIt’s all subject to supply and demand in the open market.

For Blanton’s price point I think I’d rather have Four Roses single barrel. Especially considering when I find it lately it’s been marked up so much cuz the name recognitionType VIX into your watch list.  It’s the CBOE Market Volatility Index.  Maybe it’s blocked for some traders?  I don’t know why it would be...  Volumes are low so spreads can get out of hand, but it’s been easy money for me the last couple months.Don’t mess with putting money in VIX if your are new to the game. Just use it as a volatility indicator for the market as a whole when considering other trades.  VIX trades have a lot of moving parts, expire at market open (rather than close), etc.RIP in peace

Username does not check out.i hope you’re right so i can afford itNo, just my current holdings...

Will adjust at Monday open.Bro if you can’t figure it out based on the information I have provided, I can’t help you.Jesus you didn’t even read that post: you get 2 warrants for 9 shares, and one extra warrants per 9 units which aren’t available anymore.You will get 2 warrants per 9 shares if you hold through the merger. There is a risk to holding through merger, as most SPACs drop then, hence the incentive. Shares are good because they have a floor of $20. Warrants have no floor and so carry more risk, but they can also offer a higher reward in the event that the price rockets.

You gotta have your facts straight, don’t just shoot from the hip based on retards’ DDs.Yeah I got fiber as well. Wouldn’t know anything about wiring shit like that. So it’s definitely possible? Might see if I have a buddy that could do it, so I could hardwire to my master. Would it be worth doing that, or should I just go full mesh network?The Nest WiFi access points don’t have Ethernet ports now. Just the main one have one Ethernet port.  I use a switch to hook up the ps5 and Apple TV.What makes you think that? I’m not being a dick. I’m honestly interestedMy last diamond hand was FB 300c ex1/15 that I got in September, was up 50% twice before all the bullshit. Lost a cool 15k so I’m pretty shaken from diamond hands. Still very bullish on FB though. I think the coming Er will be a big bumpYeah I genuinely don’t care anymore if I get covid . I actually hope I get it every day so I can finally start living a life and not be a massive coward having to put my life on pause for months on end. Trump got it and recovered like come onYeah I’ve had friends have it they are fine . People are making out to be some bullshit that turns you into a zombie like what the fkDoesn’t mean everyone else will have a similar reaction. It’s foolish to think soI did 25.5, which would've been fine eod friday but I panicked in the morning when it was over 26. PLTR does seem to be beginning an uptrend now thoughLessssgo. Are you just going to hold if it breaks lower?Yeah. I figured with a weekly or monthly you’re very exposed to IV with earnings since they’re often inflated going into earnings. I was thinking with a 3 month out option I’d be able to weather the storm if there was any type of crush or downfall in price but, honestly I didn’t want to leave gains on the table due to my ignorance or potentially go in the red when I could sell for a profit.holy fuck.I can't even text my boss to gloat. He'd probably fire meI’d buy some contracts to find out$75 to transfer an account and I think $0.75 a contract for optionsyou realize the first time EVER for THCB to reach $10.70 was on Nov 23, right after I posted the DD?lmao you literally made a post on "thcb and qs to the moon" on Dec 23 at the fucking top, please tell me what is mooning next so I can short itIt might, but a quote was created to answer thisAt least I’m not a bearLook im not trying to fear monger but all bubbles went vertical before they collapsed, I cant predict the future and I might be overreacting, but there is a scary coralationHere look at this top is tesla bottom is qcom https://imgur.com/gallery/lLghePuWhat time is the bestI don't think it's stripe either, but I think that if it was, they would still have to deny it.TA bot?yesI sold $15 G H I V myself and bought back to close when they hit near 0.15. I was pretty happy with my first CC experienceI put 10k into ICLN, made $2k (20%)from it going up last week and $160 (1.6%) return in 2 weeks. If I hypothetically sold these calls every month I would get close to 45% return just from selling the calls. 

Edit: but yeah you’re right most of the time.That's my thoughts as well. 20% in a week and due for some correction.Return to this comment in 6 monthsI’m sure you’re right. I bet there wouldn’t have been a massive uproar calling out the nfl. No one would’ve intervened and everyone would’ve acted mature.Ok I think I got it. So there’s different rules based on the perception or how large an organization is?I think his self driving will be his main competitive advantage in the future. I hope EV competitors catch up to the hardware and prices begin to drop tho:(((Umm check again we got time in this hoeNot my point. It's about legal liability and the difference between being classified as a platform or a publisher.

I should have known this sub wouldn't understand.

My bad.I get it, but they want to be free from liability (platform), but control speech (publisher). Platforms can't be sued (liability), but publishers can be sued by the content they allow.

They want the cake, and eat it too.Don’t Fox News and CNN already decide what is ok for you to hear? Same thing.Get fucked loser, this isn’t a political forum. Big tech makes me money they can do whatever they want.People were calling for insurrection and killing of politicians, big tech is not democrat or republican they just want good PR and more money.haha before i got into options that was the biggest one day loss in my accountit didn’t even know they had an upcoming drug announcementYep same I thought they were gonna expire worthlessThat’s the one she uses for herself 🤢As I like to tell folks, my business most likely is not your business.  But let's have lunch.You'll prob be fine unless IV crush. I don't really expect nio to stay down with such a strong presentation. I bought the puts on friday I'm just getting in and getting out, then using the profit from puts back into shares lmaoTheta gang is going to be killing youYeah - I don’t confirm your biases. I don’t fit in here. 

66% correction coming soon. Strap upThat answers my question. This week was the local maximum for TSLA.That's true only 10pm after all. Better idea when european market opens.Anytime you see VIX brewing while ES/SPX is modestly down means the market is pricing in more uncertainty for whatever that may be building up.

After all, means the avg pricing of puts are building up vs calls. 

Sometimes it's pretty obvious when market is pricing in a correction like back in early Sep when everything is going to the moon but then VIX was going green as well.

Anyways this is low volume and early. I was just surprised it was at 3% that's all.It’s true I bought TAN at one point lolIm just seeing too many finally people selling their shit. Which is why I said I see it flattening for a week or two before selling offWho's worrying? It obviously works just wondering if it works on an individual level although I guess it would become harder and harder to borrow money.You didn’t. You wouldn’t!No I welcome the competition and wish the best man (or in your case the best woman) luck! 😝What’s ur alt?Do you even know what the definition of thot is retard?I’d think the dude is an attention whoreEnlighten a retard, how it’s up 2% if the price is 229, but us price is 236??Adam Grimes has a book on TA that is good

Adam Mancini on Twitter is a good guy to follow, he uses nothing but TA and he does it the right way.

Those colored lines you see in the pictures in my profile are drawn connecting 2 highs or 2 lows.

For instance, there is one with a dark red line that runs through the February high and September high. 

The further back a trend line goes, the stronger it generally is. Intraday trend lines are pretty useless, but trend lines that go back months work.I saw. Very impressive. Good work.

I don’t know why you’re convinced I am making this up lmaoMy avg cost is just shy of the current price, so I'm not very bearish, only by couple of hundred dollars. I got in to diversify my portfolio more but after all of the political dramas, it's just sitting there and not printing. I'm tired of holding it while passing on other bullish opportunities. Thinking of closing the positions to buy some more ICLN leaps calls.Nah ive been making bank  buying the dips and selling the rips since 9$.Oh my badMy guy i have $45k and only $30k is exposed to the market. Ive gone from $5k-$31k so far investing.

They will print big.Probably UXVY $12 2022 or VIXY $20 2022 calls, both of which will increase if VIX goes up.Like I said, I’m getting rich or going broke.Totally agree...

What a dickhead.Your local drug dealer.   🤷‍♂️Basically your posts on Twitter arent press releases. They are ads. They want certain ads. If they censored your private communication that you paid for thatd be a different story.It is perfectly applicable. Scale means nothing. If i see someone screaming i should have the right to kick them out. If i dont then im gonna go to some shitty businesses tomorrow and start screaming lol.❄️ All you want, unregulated speech on the internet is not possible other than going through tor. This is the undeniable truth, regardless of where you stand on censorshipOr just be lazy and go to [cathiesark.com](https://cathiesark.com)Ah haha ya that would be a problem watching stocks while flying. No problem. Congrats. You are correct that you’ve already won big. 🙌Lol it’s perfectly fine to never be satisfied. That’s a gift we share. And there is no consumption without production in this instance. So that’s an easy argument to make. 

Just take my advice about the goals: “If I hit X by Y, I’ll buy myself (or do or whatever) Z”.Nope... only reason I’m half way comfortable is the

What do I knowBanks still are turning away from funding oil companies to push the renewable energy and climate change initiative/narrative. Means anyone finding new oil needs to float the entire project. 

You also currently have a bunch of educated professionals looking for work in other industries because oil took such a huge hit during the pandemic for employment as well as big tech no longer assisting/lending their programs and software for increased exploration.


All forces are making it expensive to find new oil while all entities are cutting back supply to increase costsPuts on CanadaGlad I heldnah to get chinese money you need to be forced to align the political correctness in China, like the hololive incidentWow that really is huge.

Asking seriously because I’d like to learn more  about sports but I’m a fucking dweebDefinitely. My guess is that travel sector stocks that are the same as they were in March last year are likely to rebound when everything blows over and people need to cure their stir crazy.

The only thing that sucks is that there's no growth right now, so there are technically better investments.

Break even on the day.Yeah I replaced it with pen bc I forgot the name of the action and didn’t want others to get confused. I’ve only counted online and done OK. Looked for places I the north east USA that have better shoes (Atlantic city and the likes) and couldn’t find anything I was comfortable with.Congrats on the local game, I agree as travel gets easier to do, restriction gets tougher. Especially with the fact that they have counters watching the boards on their staff. Oh well, love the idea I was just a bit late to the gameI ust seen that. They’re expensive bro. Best of luck lol.You are forgetting how many multi-millionaires there are. That’s the reason why in main city’s that are HCOL area nobody blinks at a 5mill house where they are selling like hot cakes. 

Looking at homes like that and saying a group of people live there and can’t afford it doesn’t make your life any better lol.Go get 'em buddy I'm cheering for youGotcccha yeah tough for me to short with stimmies still printing but it seems logicalI will take a chance before the merger and go in with 10% for PSAC in case the deal goes bad. What about you?Old Forester Rye is amazing as well.I have been chronically disappointed by Four Roses.  Not sure if it's just a pallet thing or I am I unimpressed.I bought NIO 1/15 66c

Just one contract, and not because I think it's a brilliant play.  More just to break my cherry.  I want to do small, safe trades until I feel like I have some idea what I'm doing.  I have a couple 100k in play at vanguard and I want to do some puts as insurance also, I'm willing to spend some money in order to sleep well.Kinda surprised nobody has brought that back as an F2P game.And that's your argument? So more people will use robotaxis instead of personal cars? And that's supposed to help Tesla... how? 

You're a clown my friendYou said that already, but you didn't say how you know. If I own shares wouldn't they have sent me a notification informing me?Gotcha lolLolLol kI read enough PSTH 🚀That’s basically what I said though? You get 2 additional shares/warrants for every 9 shares you hold through merger at a lower cost per share. 

Wasn’t trying to tell you which way to go, just referring to the filing which you now are aware of. I’ll probably hold my shares regardless until it’s a target that I’m not high onYeah man it's really easy.  Mesh is easier but for my gaming stuff I keep all of it hardwired, but like i said, the kids don't complain about anything and I have their consoles on the wireless.I’ll start with - I’m probably wrong. But, I think with new stimulus talks, fall through and reconditioning of the Republican Party, shift to green energy - I think we are still in a solid run up, but I know that regardless of my political opinions on trump, he has proven to be a sore loser and probably has many advocates to help him hurt the US in spite (he is best friends with Un, after all)



Really it comes down to this - no one knows, I just think we have a bit more of a rally before a correction like last year, and then another turn forward, in the same fashion of last year, that will dampen the idea that Trump handled the economy poorly. If his last year and Biden’s first year are the same, Trump isn’t the “worst president ever” anymore, but instead “caught in the turning of tides”I’ll tell ya man...locking in small profits feels shitty when you see a position fly after you locked in, but hat feels even worse is knowing you could have locked in Something and then get absolutely destroyed. There are always new opportunities to make money by the market, but there are even more opportunities to lose money by you. Trust your gut, lock in your gains and keep rolling. You got thisWell its seem to affect everyone very differently. One of my friends is in his early 30s and used to run marathon, but he was stuck on a respirator for 3 weeks back in June. He is okayish now, but just started back at his job (he is a doctor working with covid patients). His girlfriend got it as well at the same time and she didn't even feel a thing.I mean I’m not gonna trust media on something like this. People like to see things go to shit, so they just hype it up. Everyone I know, including older grandparents, ended up being fine. I’m sure some people get it bad, but let’s be real, those same people would be rekt by the regular flu.Yeah I've had a few close ones too but have decided to wait until about 2pm to see if theta works against, if I actually want to close anything that's now made me money. 

I have 1600 shares right now so I'm playing with a fair bit. Closed all of them by about 2pm last Friday and opened for this Friday starting at 27, 27.5, 28.Average down lolLmfao right. What even is this game rn?I feel like I’m watching a college game, not playoff nflIf Cleveland manages to lose at this point it would probably be the most browns thing that could ever possibly happen and the universe would implodeTry harder, maybe you'll make some money too10:30am- 11am

But I have been holding my calls since NovemberTechnical analysis bot, but I'm not putting money on it because over the last 7 days it did go down at least 23%. Its likely we could see that this week as well. I can keep you updated on it when market opens.You can buy them back 🤨Just sell em every week fuck it lol20% gain is what I am waiting for. It hits that, and I am out. Bought at $350. If there is dip, I will hold and wait. 

Apple really could’ve had this market. Roku launched their product around the same time as AppleTV. 2008 ish. 

This is why I am not bullish on the iCar. Being a $2T co doesn’t guarantee success.Oh I'm not saying cancel culture would have been chill, just that it would have been fair and fine by me.It is not really a matter of rules. It's a matter of how those in power wield that power. Trump behaved poorly using Twitter and Twitter had a way to use its power to limit his impact. Kaepernick was using his platform as an NFL player to bring attention to something totally outside the NFL. Ironically, now that speaking out against injustice is a bit more en vogue, the NFL is doing a lot to try to do what Kaepernick was doing all along.For sure. On Carvana you can find 2021 Tesla for like 35k doe which I would 💯 buy if I came up big enough to do so😬😬😬You right, take it to r/politics they'll understand you there.There’s no legal definition of a platform. All Section 230 says is:

“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider." 

You can still sue people for libel/defamation for sharing information through social media, but the site isn’t responsible.Now imagine if only CNN existed.People call for crazy shit on r/politics too. You can find insane shit on any public forum with 500k+ people.

But big tech looks the other way because they clearly chose a side.Yeah I think they unexpectedly cancelled a trial so it wasn’t scheduled.

Still a huge overreaction in the share price though, they have a backup drug for that already in phase II i think.

You still in or did you say fuck it?🥭: “SAD”Lmao okay, I don’t even have positions in Tesla I’m cash rn. But yes you still must be new to the stock market and have not observed Tesla as well as the rest of the entire market since last March. Logic no longer exists pal.Looks like we got the next Autist Burry here

If it was so easy to time bubble, everyone would be doing itIt’s a secret 🤫Yeah but can you identify a joke when you see one?Making social media posts on any website is being an "attention whore" though. Technically, we are both doing that right now.I honestly don't know the exact correlation. I suspect we are leading them, and they are catching up to us?Fuck. I feel like I was touched by greatnessDamn bro, you might be right... she keeps sucking my dick, i have to do itPussyDude your digging here, do you want another shovel? 😂

I have a twitter account BTW thank you 😘

CNN? I'm a Europoor I don't watch your news channels, I tuned in a small bit during the elections that's about it.Nah you’re good, I’m not convinced until it’s +7%

I hope it doesNo you've gone too far back now! They're alluding to the Paris agreement of 1918 where Mr. Wilhelm and his howitzers were dutifully told to fuck off by Marshall Petain and his little Renault pea shootersEven gay bears like football. I’m not sure what that makes you.I think soIll try that, thank youI’m celibate, sorry boo.Do me nextDon’t kid yourself. Dems are gonna take full advantage of owning the prez, senate and house that they may only have for 4 years. 

It’s gonna be a flurry of bills. And they won’t have to send them back and forth for years cuz they’ll all be on the same page.Any chance on OPEC undercutting US and keeping prices low? I’m not sure how tariffs could come into playGme will never see $30 againso the actions he took to avoid offending the political bottomline is essentially politicalSame, I don't believe they have a beta car out in a year time, would be shockedYeah but the bubble has barely started getting inflated yet no where close to popping. You tesla bears have been wrong for years. How long until you see the light.It’s literally my name.Even if you didn’t think the dems would sweep that was the bullish hedge 

That shit is gonna be the gift that keeps on givingOf course buddy happy to helpI think it’s bad luck. Not sure if others do, but when I was big into sports gambling I swore off betting on my team after some unfortunate losses because my team didn’t cover.Ugh I know the feeling - it can be frustrating, but at least CCL is way above the S&P since April. We should get growth with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine data and more Oxford data by the end of the month.


There is also CDC data with what % of the population has been vaccinated, so hopefully cases/deaths drop as the at-risk get vaccinated...then cruise stocks should rise...


GOOD LUCK!!!My point...making money is possible at ALL times... bubble or no bubbleYou are going to extreme lengths to defend a corporation, and for that I condemn you yo retard jailI already have 20k in calls bought on Friday dip 🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🧟🧟🧟🧟Just popped up when I opened it.They will still try to sell at 3pm and it will count as a day trade. I have some money but I’m not gainsporn rich in there yet. I assume it’s just random.Sombody piss in your cheerios or what? Your kind of rude bud. Fucking 🌈🐻Criticized daddy Trump a bit too much for a certain moderator's liking.Word i know people have been going hard over the past 2-3 years, but never sparked my interest. Thats about to changeIt seems to have the right ingredients for a jump. I might go in with 1k-2k.Have you had small batch or single barrel? 

I agree the regular is underwhelming. 

If you like more oaky have you had Stagg Jr?Or Old Forester 1920You never know, it could work out given all the NIO news lately...  good luck!  My first option trade was a $300 SPY put contract that I sold for ~$1200 thanks to being a news junkie and guessing a market dump.  After that I lost a few thousand over a year of teaching myself what not to do.The US will always be divided into two groups: the haves and the have nots. The haves will buy Teslas, the have nots will realize that it simply doesn't make economic sense to own a shitty car when you can get a ride on a rich dude's Tesla for a small fee.It’s been the talk of the town in this subStill not getting rid of NIO thoYou just don’t seem 100% on the details is all. Eg “shares/warrants at a lower cost”Ight I got something to consider now. I’ll do some research, but if I can hook the Xbox directly to a mesh router i’d think it should be enough for me.Thanks man. Gl to you with everything I really mean itGood luck this week. I didn't roll them out yet because I think PLTR will regain what it lost on Friday.there's a ben's a rapist joke in there somewhereHow retarded would it be to log back into bovada and bet on the steelers pulling it fucking off?The fact that you bought common shares means you don't know how to make money off SPACs. And thanks I'm up 5M in 2020.Thoughts on 45c 1/1/22 ? Or 35c 4/16Your TA bot is saying $QS going up this week?Yeah you should almost always buy them back if you’re up over 90%. At that point the best you can do is make an extra 10% and if some news pops up you can lose unlimited profit.I would but the ducking Chicago exchange hasn’t written that many expiration dates.Roku's low cost for entry and partnerships with television manufacturers has made it an absolute force.

Bull signs include Draft Kings tripling their ad spend on the platform.

[Even The ROKU channel is getting traction with 14% growth between quarters \(more than the 11% install base for ROKU\)](https://twitter.com/GrousARK/status/1347559092575985664).

But like I said, I'm excited for Roku's future and earnings (I think February), I'm just waiting for a dip this week or next because of their run-up.We have a chance but we needed a score thereSounds great. How is that anyone’s problem except the GOP?It’s optics though, 5 people dead and a cop as well. Big tech def responsible for lots of stoking of the fire but needed a concrete person or tho my to blame and they fit the bill pretty wellsaid fuck it and sold for a loss. i was over diversified at the time anyway. now i’m split between ark and icln and keep some cash on hand to play weekliesYeah I’m aware. I’m not new to the stock market. I just know what a bubble top looks like. 

I’ll leave it at that. Check back in a few monthsHe cannot. He is not autistic and does not belong here if he's taking posts here seriouslyMake better jokes retard😝OkayAh shit!My powers are weak nowDoubt it. I'm sure Opec wants prices higher with lower supply then lower with low supply. Everyones hurting now while China gets further ahead.

Russia and Opec need money

And frankly lets say they did. It would bankrupt US companies and eventually oil futures would sling shot higher even faster. 

Look at UCO and USO. Theres no world in the future that can exist as bad as last March and negative cost. 

Prices are going to swing up no matter what.Well I don't see you making that point at all. I was just replying to your one comment stating "You can't act like every stock is a bubble bud". Basically the entire market is overvalued at these levelslmao YOU DO yikes bro sikorsky has nothing to do with itPositions?

PENN $100c 4/16
OKTA $270c 2/19
APHA $8.5c 2/5
CLOV $20c 12/17

NIO $55p 1/22Nice, it just happened to me to. I just went to look at NIO options prices and it popped up. Good luck with these new trades!Nope. Just tired of providing info to other people for good money stocks, and they either don’t read what’s happening in other comments in this topic, or they just don’t research. Besides, the iCar news has been pretty big the past couple days.Nice. Yeah it’s fun I like watching games. This time of year is fun because of NFL playoffs. I also really like March madness for college hoopsI have had single barrel.  Didn't mind it.  I have not had Stagg Jr.  On my list.Huge Old Forrester Rye fan.  Huge.  Turned into a bar staple at my house.Except Tesla is currently worth more than the market pandering to both the haves and the have-nots.

It's always startling how Tesla fanboys don't understand how ridiculously overpriced Tesla isThat’s why I used terms like “I’ve heard” and non specifics. Wasn’t trying to be misleading just suggesting you look at the filing DD. 

Either way we on the same teamAnd you as well. We all in it together everyone wants to eat ya know. Much love happy new year100 percent truly retardedOr should I say. Do it pussy, you won’t. This is the way. Lmao 😂I’m fuckin with the $45’s... it accounts for some fuckery in the mean timeWell one of them but not the actual one which specifically says call.Interesting. So you can sell FDs on anything (uncovered) and once you profit you can buy it back to closeARKG has a pretty good stake in VRTXQuit making assumptions. When you assume you make an ass out of U and ME. I’m not claiming it’ll go up nor down, just stating my observations. If you were at all doing the same since March you’d realize fundamentals as well as any sort of logic is no longer relevant. Bubbles included.Learn how to get a real buzz (like meth or crack). I bet you vape don't you?Ima fan of the mango man

Give me racist redneck or some bullshit flair

Plz do me daddyOk then, all inThe point of my thread was about traders’ lack of conviction. No matter the circumstances of the market as a whole, conviction with trades is representative of your own confidence that stems from your research. You simply cannot use the excuse that the metaphorical “bubble” is going to pop in order to justify your lack of confidence and conviction. Traders now have 0 backbone and point to lofty valuations to give themselves reason to be scared and even lazy.I’m excited and ready to lose it all!Stagg jr is great. 

I got lucky and got a George T Stagg this year. One of the best pours I’ve ever had

Haven’t had the OF Rye but I do love a good ryeYour missing the forest for the trees, TSLA has solved the automotive and rideshare industries, and with solar and batteries they are getting into the grid which is opening up a new market.[done ](https://imgur.com/a/9wIRSaX) worth the $1

☺️Yeah, if you want. But, Definitely more risk.vrtx is absolutely dominant in their cystic fibrosis treatmentsI bet you have putsNo thanksLook at this https://youtu.be/CQr2wiFMMDMI understand this point and think it's valid to a degree but the current market situation is very unpredictable. We're at ATH, currencies are volatile, oil is volatile, pending tariffs and trade agreements, it's really hard to be super confident that any one stock or etf is going to head in a specific direction atm. These are the times where hedge funds and professional traders that know how to hedge their positions effectively make their worthI have started the move over as so much new "premium" bourbon is trending towards scotchSo it's going into... another saturated, low-margin bubble market? That again doesn't explain why the valuation is so ridiculously high.God I can’t imagine getting assigned on some shit for like 50k. How you even get out of that lmaoI learned that when I was in PTI and lost like 70% overnight when their cystic fibrosis drug failed to beat Orkambi.Lmao coming from a guy who gets a buzz from nicotine.  If thats not the gayest bear post ive ever seen. Go smoke another cigarette and sit on your moms couch and enjoy the buzz, pussy
